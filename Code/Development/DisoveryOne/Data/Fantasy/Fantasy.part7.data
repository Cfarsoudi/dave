          FADE IN:

          On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
          with a billion stars.
          Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
          BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
          breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

          1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
          down the street and heads out of town.

          2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2

          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
          at the sky.
          JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
          spare parts of other devices.

                         JANE
          Hurry!
          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
          well, rubbing his head.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh-- watch your head.

                         SELVIG
          Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"
          of yours supposed to look like?

                         JANE
          It's a little different each time.
          Once it looked like, I don't know,
          melted stars, pooling in a corner
          of the sky. But last week it was a
          rolling rainbow ribbon--

                         SELVIG

                         (GENTLY TEASING)
          "Racing "round Orion?" I've always
          said you should have been a poet.
          Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A.

                         JANE
          Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
          my gloves, will you?
          Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
          a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Not until you see it!

                         SELVIG
          (re: the gloves)
          I recognize those. Think how proud
          he'd be to see you now.
          Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.

                         JANE
          Thank you.

                         SELVIG
          For what?

                         JANE
          The benefit of the doubt.
          The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
          they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          It's never taken this long before.
          Darcy calls up from the front seat.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Can I turn on the radio?

                         JANE
          (an edge to her voice)
          Sure, if you like rocking out to
          KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
          time."
          Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

          3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3

          The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
          equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
          together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
          handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
          frustrated Jane with sympathy.

                         JANE
          The anomalies are always
          precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
          She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
          tracking occurrences and patterns.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          The last seventeen occurrences have
          been predictable to the minute... I
          just don't understand.
          Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
          She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
          the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.

                         DARCY
          Jane?
          Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
          champagne begins to vibrate.

                         JANE
          There's got to be some new
          variable... Or an equipment
          malfunction...
          The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
          them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.

                         DARCY
          I don't think there's anything
          wrong with your equipment...
          The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
          shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
          They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
          the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
          everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Jane?

                         JANE
          What?!

                         DARCY
          I think you want to see this.
          Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
          the desert --

          MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
          Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

                         JANE
          Holy. Shatner.

                         SELVIG
          That's your "subtle" aurora?!

                         JANE
          No-- yes! Let's go!

          4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4

          The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
          event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
          out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
          The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
          her, yanks her back in.

          5 INT. SUV 5

          Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

                         JANE
          Isn't this great?!
          A thought strikes her.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          You're seeing it too, right? I'm
          not crazy?

                         SELVIG
          That's debateable. Put your seat
          belt on!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
          The SUV lurches.

          6 EXT. DESERT 6

          Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
          out of the clouds comes --

          AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
          Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
          thousand freight trains as it touches down.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.

          7 INT. SUV 7

          Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
          enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
          into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
          window, TAPING the storm.

                         JANE
          You've gotta get us closer so I can
          take a magnetic reading.
          Darcy laughs.

                         DARCY
          Yeah, right! Good one!
          (then, realizing)
          Oh God, you're serious...

                         JANE
          You want those college credits or
          not?

          8 EXT. SUV 8

          The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
          leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
          two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
          take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
          strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
          them with a terrifying intensity.

          9 INT. SUV 9

          The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
          the wheel, starts to head away.

                         DARCY
          Keep the credits. I'll intern at
          Burger King.

                         JANE
          What are you doing?!

                         DARCY
          Saving our lives!
          Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
          struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --

                         A MAN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
          Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
          slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
          The SUV swerves -- but too late.

          10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

          The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
          him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

          11 INT. SUV 11

          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
          They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
          A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

          12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12

          The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
          man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
          charred and blackened.

                         DARCY
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

                         JANE
          Get the first aid kit.
          Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
          next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
          She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
          clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
          long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
          features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
          the life back into him.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.
          Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
          his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
          azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
          them.
          For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
          The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
          freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.

                         DARCY
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.
          A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
          She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

                         JANE

                         HIS EYES--

                         DARCY

                         (DREAMILY)
          --are beautiful.

                         JANE
          --are dilating. That's a good
          sign.

                         SELVIG
          We still have to get him to a
          hospital.

                         JANE

                         (HOPEFULLY)
          After we get a reading on the
          storm?

                         SELVIG
          Immediately, Jane.
          Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
          above their heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
          glowing remnants of the storm, and into:

          13 EXT. SPACE 13

          EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
          resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.)
          Questions, they've always asked
          questions -- this race called man,
          on this planet they call earth.
          Passionately longing to know how
          they are connected to the heavens.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
          We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
          cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
          galaxy.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In ages past, they looked to us as
          gods, for indeed so many times we
          saved them from calamity. We tried
          to show them how their world was
          but one of the Nine Realms of the
          Cosmos, linked to all others by the
          branches of Yggdrasil...
          We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
          sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
          shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
          out into the black void of space.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
          a universe of wonder, beauty, and
          terror that they barely
          comprehended.
          We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
          a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But for all their thirst for
          knowledge, they let our lessons
          fall into myth and dreams.
          Where did he come from? He came
          from us, the proudest race of
          warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
          He came from this -- the greatest
          Realm the universe has ever known.
          We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
          over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
          what's on the other side:

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He came... from Asgard!

          14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14

          Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
          landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
          modern yet timeless.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.

          15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15

          The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
          other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
          out before it.
          We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE

                         STANDS --

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
          land at his side.

          16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16

          Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
          vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

                         ODIN
          Do you think he's ready?

                         FRIGGA
          He thinks he is. He has his
          father's confidence.

                         ODIN
          He'll need his father's wisdom.

                         FRIGGA
          And his humility?
          Odin reacts.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
          at his side to give him counsel.
          Have faith in your sons.

                         ODIN
          Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
          could be a great King...
          Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
          synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
          as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
          trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
          sheer will.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
          Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
          A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (QUIETLY)
          ...if we only had more time.

                         FRIGGA
          For once, our son needs something
          we cannot provide.

                         ODIN
          I can fight it a little longer...

                         FRIGGA
          No. You've put it off too long! I
          worry for you.
          He touches her cheek.

                         ODIN
          I've destroyed demons and monsters,
          devastated whole worlds, laid waste
          to mighty kingdoms, and still you
          worry for me?

                         FRIGGA
          Always.

                         ODIN
          Not today. Now come kiss your
          king... while I'm still king.
          He pulls her close, and they kiss.

          17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17

          Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
          hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
          fire lit room.
          Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
          against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
          recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
          Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
          An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
          He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
          below.

                         THOR
          Another!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
          The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
          intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
          length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
          He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
          the Hall.
          We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
          shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
          horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
          from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
          horned headpiece.
          Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
          a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
          throne room.

                         LOKI

                         (TO THOR)
          Nervous, brother?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.

                         THOR
          Have you ever known me to be
          nervous?

                         LOKI
          There was the time in Nornheim...

                         THOR
          That wasn't nerves, brother. It
          was the rage of battle. How else
          could I have fought my way through
          a hundred warriors and pulled us
          out alive?
          The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
          Thor.

                         LOKI
          As I recall, I was the one who
          veiled us in smoke to ease our
          escape.

                         THOR
          Some do battle, others just do
          tricks.
          The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
          it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
          EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
          across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
          goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Loki...
          Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
          back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that was just a waste of good
          wine.

                         LOKI
          Just a bit of fun.
          (to the Attendant)
          Right, my friend?
          The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED

          HELMET.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          (re: Thor's helmet)
          Nice feathers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.

                         THOR
          You don't really want to start this
          again, do you, Cow?

                         LOKI
          I was being sincere!

                         THOR
          You're incapable of sincerity.

                         LOKI
          Am I?
          He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I've looked forward to this day as
          long as you have. You're my
          brother and my friend. Sometimes
          I'm envious, but never doubt that I
          love you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
          Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
          He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
          liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
          brother's shoulder.

                         THOR
          Thank you.
          The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

                         LOKI
          Give us a kiss.

                         THOR
          Stop.
          Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          How do I look?

                         LOKI
          Like a king.
          They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It's time.

                         THOR
          You go ahead.
          Loki casts him a wary look.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'll be along. Go on.
          Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.

          17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A

          VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
          event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
          stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
          eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
          FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
          moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
          holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
          dreamily.

                         FANDRAL
          Thank you, love.
          (to the Maidens)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.

                         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Now who'd like to polish my sword
          for me?
          The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
          HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
          of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
          the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
          ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
          Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
          Attendant quickly backs away.
          From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
          SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
          HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
          reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
          on the table.

                         SIF
          (to the weapons)
          I'll miss you.

          18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18

          Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
          room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
          Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
          Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
          the front of the hall. They are:

          THE WARRIORS THREE
          VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
          oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
          swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
          HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
          side.
          With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
          a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
          with.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I hope this goes quickly. I'm
          famished.

                         FANDRAL

                         (FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
          Noooo!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Are you attached to that pretty
          face of yours? Because one more
          word, and you won't be.

                         FANDRAL
          (to the others)
          My, we are hungry, aren't we?
          The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
          it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
          Just one smile.
          Hogun stares at him grimly.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          All right, half a smile. Look,
          forget the smile, just show some
          teeth.

                         SIF
          Fandral, is it true the famous
          Warriors Three are ready to meet
          any challenge?

                         FANDRAL
          Name it, Lady Sif.

                         SIF
          Keep your mouth shut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12.

          19 INT. VAULT - DAY 19

          Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready,
          stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath
          the palace.
          A cold BREEZE blows past them.

          19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A

          Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
          hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

                         FRIGGA
          It's all right to be nervous.

                         THOR
          Why does everyone keep saying that?
          I'm not nervous!

                         FRIGGA
          You may be able to fool the rest of

                         ASGARD --

                         THOR
          ...but never you. I know.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor, just remember that you have
          something even the great Allfather
          never had.

                         THOR
          And what is that?

                         FRIGGA
          Me for a mother.
          She smiles.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Now don't keep your father waiting.
          Frigga leaves.

          20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20

          Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki
          and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the
          hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
          the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
          formation. They part to reveal --

                         ODIN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
          Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
          holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
          him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
          Ruler of Asgard.
          Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
          casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
          seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
          A murmur spreads through the crowd.

                         VOLSTAGG
          (sotto, to Loki)
          Where is he?

                         LOKI
          He said he'd be along.
          Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What?

                         SIF
          He wants to make an entrance.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
          he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
          like he's ready to feed him to his
          ravens.

                         LOKI
          I wouldn't worry. Father will
          forgive him. He always does.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13.
          Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
          lower level --

                         MJOLNIR
          Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
          behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
          CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
          before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
          adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.

                         SIF
          Oh, please.
          Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

          21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21

          As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
          breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
          warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
          something's not right.
          They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
          hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
          pedestal.
          LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
          SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

          22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22

          Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
          of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
          Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
          her. She can't help but smile.
          Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
          The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
          authority.
          He raises Gungnir before him.

                         ODIN
          Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
          power strong. With it I have
          defended Asgard and the lives of
          the innocent across the Nine Realms
          since the time of the Great
          Beginning. And though the day has
          come for a new King to wield his
          own weapon -- that duty remains the
          same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
          first-born.

                         ODIN (CONT'D)
          So long entrusted with this mighty
          hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
          heart of a dying star, from the
          sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
          lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
          wields this hammer commands the
          lightning and the storm. Its power
          has no equal -- as a weapon, to
          destroy, or as a tool, to build.
          It is a fit companion for a King.

          23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23

          The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
          strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
          catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
          and BLUE-SKINNED.
          One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
          to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
          Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
          standing in the shadows behind it.
          As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
          They turn back around.
          Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

          24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24

          The Ceremony continues.

                         ODIN
          Today I entrust you with the
          greatest honor in all the Nine
          Realms. The sacred throne of
          Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
          achieve peace. So, too, must a new
          generation sacrifice to maintain
          that peace. Responsibility, duty,
          honor. These are not merely
          virtues to which we must aspire.
          They are essential to every soldier
          and to every King.
          The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
          their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
          hall.
          Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
          with pride.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard
          the Nine Realms?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to preserve the peace?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to cast aside all
          selfish ambition and pledge
          yourself only to the good of all
          the Realms?
          Beat.

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Then on this day, I, Odin
          Allfather, proclaim you--
          Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
          creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
          hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
          and the crowd see it too.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (REALIZING)
          Frost giants...
          The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the
          palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their
          weapons, as Thor races from the hall.

          25B INT. VAULT - DAY 25B

          Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
          Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
          stop short.
          Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
          We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
          clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
          remains on the floor.
          They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
          Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
          creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
          It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

                         SIF
          The Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          I thought it was but a legend.
          Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
          the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
          the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
          Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.

                         FANDRAL
          I've never been inside the Vault
          before. It's said the Tesseract
          was once held here.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          The Tesseract? I thought that was
          but a legend too!

                         SIF
          Shush!
          Odin surveys the destruction.

                         THOR
          The Jotuns must pay for what
          they've done!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.

                         ODIN
          They have paid with their lives.
          The Destroyer did its job, and the
          Casket is safe. All is well.

                         THOR
          "All is well?!" They broke into
          the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
          Giants had stolen even one of these

                         RELICS--

                         ODIN
          But they didn't.

                         THOR
          I want to know why they--

                         ODIN

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          The Casket of Ancient Winters
          belonged to the Jotuns. They
          believe it's their birthright.

                         THOR
          And if you hadn't taken it from
          them they would have laid waste to
          all the Nine Realms!

                         ODIN
          I have a truce with Laufey, the
          Jotun King.

                         THOR
          He just broke your truce! We must
          act!
          Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

                         ODIN
          Leave us.
          Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          And what action would you take?

                         THOR
          March into Jotunheim as you once
          did, teach them a lesson, break
          their spirits so they'll never dare
          try to cross our borders again!

                         ODIN
          You're thinking only as a warrior!

                         THOR
          This was an act of war!

                         ODIN
          It was the act of but a few, doomed
          to fail.

                         THOR
          They got this far!

                         ODIN
          We will find the breach in our
          defenses. It will be found, and it
          will be sealed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.

                         THOR
          As King of Asgard, I would--

                         ODIN
          You are not King. Not yet.
          Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
          as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
          doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
          watches him go.

          26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26

          Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
          festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
          and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
          massive tables.
          From across the room, Loki watches him.

          AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
          Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
          search of his dinner.

                         SIF
          Redecorating, are we?
          Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What's this -- ?!

                         HOGUN
          I told you they'd cancel it.

                         FANDRAL
          We thought that was just you being
          your normal cheery self.
          Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          All this food -- so innocent, cast
          to the ground. It breaks the
          heart!
          Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
          calmly moves towards him.

                         THOR
          It's unwise to be in my company
          right now, brother.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18.

                         LOKI
          Who said I was wise?

                         THOR
          (re: the empty hall)
          This was to be my day of triumph.

                         LOKI
          It will come. In time.

                         (ADMITS)
          If it's any consolation, I think
          you're right. About the Frost
          Giants, about Laufey, everything.
          If a few of them could penetrate
          the defenses of Asgard once, who's
          to say they won't try again. Next
          time with an army?

                         THOR
          Yes, exactly!

                         LOKI
          But there's nothing we can do
          without defying Father.
          Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
          Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          No... stop there! I know that
          look!

                         THOR
          It's the only way to ensure the
          safety of our borders.

                         LOKI
          It's madness!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Madness? What sort of madness?

                         LOKI
          Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

                         THOR
          The safety of our Realm is no jest.
          We're going to Jotunheim.

          What?!

                          SIF
          Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
          this is one you must not break.
          Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.

                         FANDRAL
          This isn't like a journey to Earth,
          where you summon a little lightning
          and thunder and the mortals worship
          you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And if the Frost Giants don't kill
          you, your Father will!

                         THOR
          My father fought his way into
          Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
          and took their Casket! We'd just
          be looking for answers.

                         SIF
          It is forbidden!
          Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
          case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.

                         THOR
          My friends, have you forgotten all
          that we've done together?
          He turns to Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Who brought you into the sweet
          embrace of the most exotic maidens
          in all of Yggdrasil?

                         FANDRAL
          You did.

                         THOR

                         (TO HOGUN)
          Who led you into the most glorious
          of battles...

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          ...and to delicacies so succulent,
          you thought you'd died and gone to
          Valhalla?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.

                         VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
          You did. / You did.
          He turns to Sif.

                         THOR
          And who proved wrong all who
          scoffed at the idea that a young
          maiden could be one of the fiercest
          warriors this Realm has ever known?

                         SIF
          I did.

                         THOR

                         (QUICKLY)
          True. But I supported you...
          (then, to the others)
          My friends, trust me now. We must
          do this.
          The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
          convincing him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Come on. You're not going to let
          my brother and me take all the
          glory, are you?
          Loki looks startled.

                         LOKI
          What?

                         THOR
          You are coming with me...

                         LOKI
          Yes, of course! I won't let my
          brother march into Jotunheim alone.
          I will be at his side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And I.

                         FANDRAL
          And I.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.

                         HOGUN
          And I. The Warriors Three fight
          together.

                         SIF
          I fear we'll live to regret this.

                         VOLSTAGG
          If we're lucky.

          27 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27

          Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
          across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
          ready their battle gear for their journey.
          Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
          Hogun notices.

                         THOR
          We must first find a way to get
          past Heimdall.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That will be no easy task. It's
          said the Gatekeeper can see a
          single dew drop fall from a blade
          of grass a thousand worlds away.

                         FANDRAL
          And he can hear a cricket passing
          gas in Niffelheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Jest not! He heareth all!

                         FANDRAL
          Please. Getting past him should be
          simple enough now, since he seems
          to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
          under his nose.
          Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Forgive him! He meaneth no
          offense!
          Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20A.

          28 EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28

          Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
          the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
          most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

          THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
          Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
          mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
          ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
          Observatory.

          29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29

          The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
          Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
          them, blocking their way, staring them down.
          There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
          Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
          intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
          glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

                         LOKI
          Keep your weapons sheathed and your
          mouths closed. This is going to
          take subtlety and sincerity, not
          brute strength. Leave it to me.
          Loki dismounts and steps forward.

          LOKI (CONT'D)

                         GOOD HEIMDALL--

                         HEIMDALL
          You're not dressed warmly enough.
          Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.

                         LOKI
          I'm sorry?

                         HEIMDALL
          The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
          will kill you all in time, even
          Thor.

                         (THEN)
          You think you can deceive me? I,
          who watch all? I, who can sense
          the flapping of a butterfly's wings
          a thousand worlds away?
          He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.

          HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
          Or can hear a cricket passing gas
          in Niffelheim?
          Fandral looks gob-smacked.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.

                         FANDRAL
          That was just a bit of a jest,
          really...
          Loki goes into damage control.

                         LOKI
          You must be mistaken. We're not--

                         THOR

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          Enough.

                         (TO HEIMDALL)
          Heimdall, may we pass?
          Heimdall stares him down.

                         HEIMDALL
          For ages have I guarded Asgard and
          kept it safe from those who would
          do it harm. In all that time,
          never has an enemy slipped by my
          watch -- until this day. I wish to
          know how that happened.

                         THOR
          Then tell no one where we've gone
          until we've returned.
          Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
          pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
          him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What happened? Your silver tongue
          turn to lead?

                         LOKI
          Get me off this bridge before it
          cracks under your girth.
          Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.

          30 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30

          Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
          platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
          at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.

                         HEIMDALL
          Be warned. I will honor my sworn
          oath to protect this Realm as its
          Gatekeeper. If your return
          threatens the safety of Asgard,
          Bifrost will remain closed to you.
          You'll be left to die in the cold
          wastes of Jotunheim.

                         THOR
          I have no plans to die today.

                         HEIMDALL
          None do.
          Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
          apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

          31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31

          The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
          the Observatory.

          32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32

          Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
          Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
          section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
          sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
          the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
          The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
          and his five comrades stand.

                         HEIMDALL
          All is ready. You may pass.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Couldn't you just leave the bridge
          open for us?

                         HEIMDALL
          To keep this bridge open would
          unleash the full power of the
          Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
          you upon it.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Ah. Never mind, then.
          Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
          grins.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.

                         THOR
          Come on. Don't be bashful.
          The others join him at his side, then step towards the
          Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
          changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
          elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
          off the platform and inside the vortex.

          33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33

          A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
          out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
          and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
          imprinted on the ice around them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
          Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
          grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
          precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
          inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

                         THOR
          Come on, big fella. Up...!
          With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
          ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:

                         VOLSTAGG
          This belt! This belt is now my
          lucky belt! I will never remove
          it! Even when bathing!

                         FANDRAL
          You bathe?
          Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
          at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
          is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
          apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
          and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
          and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
          city lies in the distance.

                         HOGUN
          We shouldn't be here.

                         THOR
          Too late now.

                         FANDRAL
          Actually, it's not. We could turn
          right around, hop back to Asgard,
          share a mug by the fire. Could be
          nice.
          Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps we should wait.
          Thor turns back to his brother.

                         THOR
          For what?

                         LOKI
          To survey the enemy. To gauge
          their strengths and weaknesses from
          a distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I'm liking that. Gauging,
          surveying. Particularly the
          distance part.

                         THOR
          We know all we must. It's time to
          act.
          Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

                         SIF
          He's just got to swing his
          hammer...

          34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34

          The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
          shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
          looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
          Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

                         THOR
          It feels good, doesn't it? To be
          together again, adventuring on
          another world?

                         FANDRAL
          Adventuring? Is that what we're
          doing?

                         THOR
          What would you call it?

                         FANDRAL
          Freezing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Starving.

                         SIF
          Whining.

                         THOR
          How about a song to lift our
          spirits?
          The others groan.

                         HOGUN
          No, not that!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.

                         SIF
          Please don't make us sing again!

                         FANDRAL
          If I have to listen to Volstagg's
          singing voice one more time, I'll
          fall on my own sword!

                         SIF
          Well, now I'm on board.
          She and Thor share a grin.
          The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
          structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
          warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
          central plaza.

          SIF (CONT'D)
          Where are they?

                         THOR
          Hiding. As cowards always do.
          Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
          Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
          FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.

          35 EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35

          The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
          the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
          The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
          A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.

                         JOTUN SENTRY
          What is your business here,
          Asgardian?
          The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.

                         THOR
          I speak only to your King. Not to
          his foot soldiers.

          JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
          Then speak.
          Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
          where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
          waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
          proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
          his people have endured.

                         LAUFEY
          I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

                         THOR
          And I am--

                         LAUFEY
          We know who you are, Odinson. Why
          have you brought the stench of your
          blood into my world?

                         THOR
          I demand answers.
          Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.

                         LAUFEY
          You "demand?"

                         THOR
          How did your people get into
          Asgard?

                         LAUFEY
          The house of Odin is full of
          traitors.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
          by the Jotun King's words.

                         THOR
          Do not dishonor my father's name
          with your lies.

                         LAUFEY
          Your father is a murderer and a
          thief. He stole what was ours, and
          left our world in ruins. We have
          the right to reclaim the Casket.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.

                         THOR
          Not when you'd use it to make war
          against other Realms.
          Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

                         LAUFEY
          And why have you come here? To
          make peace? You long for battle.
          You crave it. I see you for what
          you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
          a boy, trying to prove himself a
          man.

                         THOR
          This boy has grown tired of your
          mockery.
          Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
          front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
          Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
          tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
          him.

                         LOKI
          Thor, stop and think. Look around
          you. We are outnumbered.

                         THOR
          Know your place, brother...

                         LAUFEY
          You should listen to his counsel.
          You know not what your actions
          would unleash.
          Laufey steps out of the shadows.

          LAUFEY (CONT'D)
          But I do. Go now, while I still
          allow it.
          Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

                         LOKI
          We will accept your most gracious
          offer.
          The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
          a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
          breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
          nearby mutters under his breath.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.

                         JOTUN
          Run back home, little princess.
          Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
          coming.

                         LOKI
          Damn.
          In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
          the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
          draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
          Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
          own!
          ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
          around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
          SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

                         FANDRAL
          I'm hoping that's just decorative.
          Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
          Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
          separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
          around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
          this.

                         THOR
          Next!
          Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Well? What move, do you think?

                         VOLSTAGG
          I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."

                         FANDRAL
          At this close range? I think "The
          Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (DISGUSTED)
          Maybe if they were three feet tall!
          No! How about "The Randy
          Valkyrie"?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.

                         HOGUN
          Shut up!
          Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
          loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
          A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
          hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
          mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
          hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
          him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
          back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
          with his mace.
          Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
          double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.

                         SIF
          If you don't treat me like a lady,
          I won't act like a lady!
          She takes out the Jotun.
          Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
          the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
          swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
          The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
          out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
          crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.

                         LOKI
          (to the falling Giant)
          Pathetic.
          He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
          either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
          once.
          Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
          The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
          punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.

                         THOR
          Come on! At least make it a
          challenge for me!
          He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
          tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
          rises, grins.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that's more like it!
          He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
          head over heels.
          Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
          back to his grasp.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          (re: the fallen Brute)
          Ugly and stupid.
          Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
          ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
          Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
          sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
          the chest. The Jotun falls dead.

                         SIF
          (to Hogun, re: knife)
          I'm so glad I taught him how to do
          that!
          Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
          hits in.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You may want to put some ice on
          that!
          The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
          a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
          Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          You may be taller, but I'm wider!
          Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
          flying.
          Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
          sending him crashing to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          It's not too late for you to
          surrender.
          Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
          bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
          Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
          Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
          Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
          ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
          Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
          to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
          opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
          out a small FLASK.
          Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
          to his comrades.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Don't let them grab hold of you!
          He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
          battle.
          Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
          stops mid ice layer.
          The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
          and the warrior drops to one knee.
          Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
          quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
          her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
          chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          (on his belly)
          Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
          had him!

                         SIF
          Of course you did.
          Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
          them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
          bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
          the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
          out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
          A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
          FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
          Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
          goes.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Hang on!
          Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
          Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
          worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
          close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

                         HOGUN
          Watch the legs!

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (REALIZING)
          Right. Sorry.
          Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
          freeing Hogun's feet.
          Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.

                         FANDRAL
          You really think your icicles are a
          match for Asgardian steel?
          Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
          away.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Fair enough.
          Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
          sword and snaps it in half.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Could we stop just a moment while I
          get another sword?
          Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
          then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
          the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
          through with his own weapon.
          The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
          pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
          forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
          rendering him helpless.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
          Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
          felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
          unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
          them off.
          Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That's unfortunate.
          He hurries to his wounded comrade.

                         FANDRAL
          I may need a bit of help. Not a
          good look, is it?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Just try not to bleed.

                         FANDRAL
          How's the face?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Flawless.
          Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
          stalagmite.
          Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
          Giants.
          The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
          hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
          grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
          his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
          Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
          of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
          -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
          painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
          The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
          unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
          distraction, KICKS the Giant.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
          Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
          the Jotuns around him.

                         THOR
          Come on!
          But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
          Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
          from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
          Mjolnir falls to the ground.
          A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
          ground, to no avail.
          Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
          slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
          leave.
          From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
          it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
          palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
          wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
          The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
          feet.

                         LOKI
          That can't be good.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Yes, it could! Might be an early
          spring!
          They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
          shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
          awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
          Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31.

                         LOKI
          Thor, we must go!
          Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
          mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
          look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
          of battle.

                         THOR
          Then go!

                         SIF
          There are too many of them!

                         THOR
          I can stop them!
          The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
          around them.

                         SIF
          Thor!
          But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Run!
          Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
          the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
          chase.
          Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
          The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
          disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

                         MOMENT --

          THOR'S FIST
          Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
          He opens his hand, beckoning.
          One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
          him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
          the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
          raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
          with all his might.
          KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
          channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
          Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
          shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.

          But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
          shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
          where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
          beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          What's Thor done?

                         LOKI
          Likely killed us all!
          As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
          mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
          quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
          The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
          a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
          move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
          Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
          raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
          the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
          comrades.

          35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A

          Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

                         THOR
          Loki, we have to see.
          Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
          But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
          the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
          many, even for a Thunder God.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (TO LOKI)
          Actually, could you bring the mists
          back, please?
          Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
          The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
          ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
          down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
          comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
          all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad
          in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
          The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
          stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
          Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
          his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
          react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
          to-face with Odin.
          Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
          about to happen.
          Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
          Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
          not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
          earshot of the others.

                         ODIN
          Laufey. End this.

                         LAUFEY
          Your boy sought this out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.

                         ODIN
          You're right. These are the
          actions of a boy. Treat them as
          such. You and I can stop this
          before there's further bloodshed.
          Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
          blade at the end of his arm.

                         LAUFEY
          We are beyond diplomacy now,
          Allfather. He'll get what he came
          for -- war and death.
          Odin looks grim, determined.

                         ODIN
          So be it.
          Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
          Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
          the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
          in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
          The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
          fleeing Jotuns with delight.

                         THOR
          Now! We'll finish them together!

                         ODIN
          Silence!
          Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
          Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
          the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
          hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
          Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

          36 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36

          Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls
          Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
          Heimdall backs away.

                         THOR
          Why did you bring us back?

                         ODIN
          Do you realize what you've done?
          What you've started?

                         THOR
          I was protecting my home.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34.

                         ODIN
          You cannot protect your friends.
          How can you hope to protect a
          kingdom?
          Odin turns to the others.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (RE: FANDRAL)
          Get him to the healing room!
          Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
          room.

                         THOR
          There won't be a kingdom to protect
          if you're afraid to act!
          Odin stares at him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Whatever the cost, the world must
          know that the new King of Asgard
          will not be held in contempt.

                         ODIN
          That's pride and vanity that talks!
          Not leadership! Have you forgotten
          everything I've taught you? What
          of a warrior's patience, cunning?

                         THOR
          While you wait and be patient, the
          Nine Realms laugh at us! The old
          ways are done. You'd stand giving
          speeches while Asgard falls!

                         ODIN
          You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

                         THOR
          And you are an old man and a fool!
          The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
          quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying
          beneath the calmness of his words.

                         ODIN
          A fool, yes! I was a fool to think
          you were ready.
          Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.

                         FATHER--
          Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
          tracks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.

                         ODIN
          Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed
          the express command of your King.
          Through your arrogance and
          stupidity, you have opened these
          peaceful Realms and innocent lives
          to the horrors of war.
          The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control
          panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along
          with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end
          of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
          Odin turns angrily to his son.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          You are unworthy of this Realm...
          Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of your title...
          He rips away Thor's cloak.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of the loved ones
          you've betrayed. I hereby take
          from you your powers.
          Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
          from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          In the name of my father...
          A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
          disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the
          chest piece.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...and of his father before...
          Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
          including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          I cast you out!
          Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
          THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and
          disappears in the vortex.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A.
          Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He
          closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something
          quietly.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERING)
          Whosoever holds this hammer, if he
          be worthy, shall possess the power
          of Thor.
          RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its
          smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then
          disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
          the Bifrost.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37

          Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's
          blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It
          swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS
          into him, as we:

          CUT TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36.
          After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

          DARCY (V.O.)
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

          JANE (V.O.)
          Get the first aid kit.

                         (THEN)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.

          THOR'S POV
          Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
          concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.

          END THOR'S POV

          TIME CUT TO:
          Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
          heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
          up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
          Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
          Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
          her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
          Thor searches the ground.

                         THOR
          Hammer...

                         DARCY
          Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
          That's pretty obvious.
          Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
          her flashlight down at the sand.

                         JANE
          Erik... look at this.
          He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
          pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
          Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
          snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
          away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We've got to move fast before
          anything changes.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We need soil samples, light
          readings, everything.
          She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
          readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
          Thor, who stares up at the sky.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, we need get him to a
          hospital.
          Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
          cannister.

                         JANE
          Not right now. It'll take too
          long. County's an hour away.
          We'll drop him off after we're done
          here.
          Selvig looks uncertain.

          JANE (CONT'D)

                         (RE: THOR)
          Look at him, he's fine.
          Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.

                         THOR
          Father! Heimdall! I know you can
          hear me! Open the bridge!

                         JANE
          (off Selvig's look)
          Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
          hospital, I'll stay here.

                         SELVIG
          You expect me to leave you alone in
          the middle of the desert?
          Thor turns to the others, frustrated.

                         THOR
          You! What world is this?
          The group is intimidated by his fervor.

                         SELVIG
          It's all right, my friend. We're
          going to get you some help.
          Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
          agitated, belligerent.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.

                         THOR
          Where am I?! Answer me!
          Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
          Jane looks on, concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.

                         JANE
          Erik, just back away...

                         SELVIG
          (to Thor, calming)
          You're in the desert outside the
          town of Puente Antiguo.

                         THOR
          What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

                         DARCY
          Uh... New Mexico?
          Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
          unsure what to make of it.

                         THOR
          You dare threaten Thor with so puny

                         A--
          Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
          ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
          ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.

                         DARCY
          What? He was freaking me out.

          38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38

          As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
          to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          Next time you decide to taser
          someone, do me a favor and make
          sure they're already inside the
          truck.

                         (TO JANE)
          Jane, come on...
          Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.

          39 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39

          The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
          overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
          energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
          into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a
          meteor.

                         40 OMITTED 40

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39.

          41 EXT. COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 41

          The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.

          42 INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 42

          Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two
          ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy
          stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          Name?

                         JANE
          He said it was "Thor."
          The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
          at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SPELLING)
          T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
          him?

                         JANE
          I've never met him before.

                         DARCY
          Until she hit him with the car.

                         JANE
          Grazed him, actually.

                         (THEN)
          Oh, and we tasered him, too.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Must have been quite the spat.

                         JANE
          I told you, I don't know him. I
          just want to make sure he's okay.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm going to need a name and
          contact number.

                         JANE
          Jane Foster.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (TYPING SLOWLY)

          J...A...N...

                         SELVIG
          Oh, for God's sake...
          He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
          business card.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          Here. Let's go.
          Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.

          43 INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43

          Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
          a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
          arm.

                         NURSE
          Hi. Just taking a little blood.
          Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.

                         THOR
          How dare you attack the son of
          Odin!

                         NURSE
          I need some help!
          Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.

          NURSE (CONT'D)
          We're trying to help you!

                         THOR
          Then bring me a healing stone, you
          savages!
          He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
          couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
          struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
          furniture overturned.

                         ORDERLY
          What the hell is this guy on?
          Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
          looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
          by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.

                         THOR
          You're no match for the Mighty--
          Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.

          44 EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 44

          Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls
          his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out,
          peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

                         TOWNIE
          Huh.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
          The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
          We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
          otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
          tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
          strains with all his might, with no luck.
          He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
          object.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.

           TOWNIE (CONT'D)
           Huh.

          45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45

          The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
          Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
          desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
          her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
          A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
          Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
          Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
          He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
          entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud.
          The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
          and excitement.

                         JANE
          Darcy, when you're done, take the
          soil samples to Professor Meyers in
          geology. Remind him, he owes me.

                         SELVIG
          We might want to perform a spectral
          analysis.

                         JANE
          "We?"

                         SELVIG
          I flew all the way out here --
          might as well make myself useful.
          This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
          inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
          rack-mounted server.

                         JANE
          You know what would be really
          useful? Do you still have that
          friend at LIGO?

                         SELVIG
          She was more than a friend.

                         JANE
          Could you call in a favor?

                         SELVIG
          You don't think this was just a
          magnetic storm?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.

                         JANE
          If I'm right, their observatory
          must have picked up gravitational
          waves during last night's event.

                         SELVIG
          Meaning?
          Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

                         JANE
          Meaning these anomalies might
          signify something bigger.

                         SELVIG
          How "big" are we talking about?
          Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
          the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
          appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
          covered with stars.

                         JANE
          I think the lensing around the
          edges is characteristic of an
          Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

                         DARCY
          A what?

                         SELVIG
          I thought you were a science major.

                         DARCY
          Political Science.
          Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

                         JANE
          She was the only applicant.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
          "theoretical" connection between
          two different points of space-time.
          Darcy stares blankly.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          A wormhole.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
          Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
          monitor.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Erik, look...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
          Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
          through the "bubble" in the clouds.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What do you see here?

                         SELVIG
          Stars.

                         JANE
          Yes. But not our stars.
          She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
          excitement.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          This is the star alignment for our
          quadrant, this time of year. So
          unless Ursa Minor decided to take
          the day off... those are someone
          else's constellations.
          Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
          Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
          the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
          image catches her eye.

                         DARCY
          Hey, check it out.
          Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.

                         SELVIG
          Is that...?

                         JANE
          I think I left something at the
          hospital.
          As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
          funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
          of a MAN.

          45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A

          At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the
          balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin,
          looking out over Asgard.

          46 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 46

          Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.

                         FRIGGA
          How could you have done this?

                         ODIN
          Do you understand what he set in
          motion? He's taken us to the brink
          of war!

                         FRIGGA
          But banishment? You would lose him
          forever? He's your son!

                         ODIN
          What would you have done?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.

                         FRIGGA
          I would not have exiled him to a
          world of mortals, stripped of his
          powers, to suffer alone. I would
          not have had the heart for such
          cruelty!

                         ODIN
          That is why I'm King.

                         (THEN)
          I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
          But there are some things that even
          I cannot undo.

                         FRIGGA
          You can bring him back.

                         ODIN
          No. His fate is in his own hands
          now.

          47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47

          Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
          wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
          avail.

                         THOR
          It's not possible.
          He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
          slips free from its restraint.

          47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A

          Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy
          nearby.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm sorry, only relatives can visit
          patients.

                         JANE

                         (THINKING FAST)
          But... I'm his wife.
          Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I thought you said you didn't know
          him.

                         JANE
          I meant I barely know him anymore.
          The man he's become. He's changed.
          I mean, what woman really knows her
          husband, anyway?

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          None of us, dear. He's in Room

          102.

          48 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 48

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the
          destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.

          They enter Thor's room.

          49 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 49

          They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.

          50 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 50

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.

          51 INT. JANE'S SUV 51

          Jane starts the car, frustrated.

                         JANE
          Typical. I just lost my most
          important piece of evidence.

                         DARCY
          So now what?

                         JANE
          We find him.

                         SELVIG
          Did you see what he did in there?
          I don't know if finding him is the
          best idea.

                         JANE
          I want to know what that thing was,
          and he may have the answers. We
          don't have a choice.

                         DARCY
          Oo-kay.
          She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

                         SELVIG
          So we're just going to spend the
          rest of the day looking for him?

                         JANE
          However long it takes.
          Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --

          BAM!
          She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
          scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.

          52 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 52

          Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.

                         JANE
          I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not
          doing that on purpose.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45.
          Thor looks up at the sky.

                         THOR
          Blue sky... one sun... This is
          Earth, isn't it?

                         DARCY
          I think you may have hit him with
          the car one time too many.

                         JANE

                         (TO THOR)
          Let's get you some clothes.

          53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53

          Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
          shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
          ROARING central fire.
          Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
          STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
          carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
          the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
          comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
          Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
          Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
          blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
          Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
          Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
          its normal color.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We should never have let him go.

                         SIF
          There was no stopping him.

                         FANDRAL
          At least he's only banished, not
          dead. Which is what we'd all be if
          that guard hadn't told Odin where
          we'd gone.

                         VOLSTAGG
          How did the guard even know?
          Loki stares at his arm.

                         LOKI
          I told him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.

                          FANDRAL
          What?

                         LOKI
          I told him to go to Odin after we'd
          left. Though he should be flogged
          for taking so long.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You told the guard?

                         LOKI
          I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
          had no idea Father would banish him
          for what he did.

                         SIF
          Loki, you're the only one who can
          help Thor now. You must go to the
          Allfather and convince him to
          change his mind!

                         LOKI
          And if I do, then what? I love
          Thor more dearly than any of you,
          but you know what he is. He's
          arrogant. He's reckless. He's
          dangerous. You saw how he was
          today. Is that what Asgard needs
          from its King?
          The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
          leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

                         SIF
          He may speak about the good of
          Asgard, but he's always been
          jealous of Thor.

                         VOLSTAGG
          True, but we should be grateful to
          him. He did save our lives.

                         HOGUN
          Laufey said there were traitors in
          the House of Odin.
          The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Why is it every time you choose to
          speak, it has to be something dark
          and ominous?

                         HOGUN
          A master of magic could easily
          bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
          The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.

                         VOLSTAGG
          No! Surely not!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.

                         FANDRAL
          Loki's always been one for
          mischief, but you're talking about
          something else entirely.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.

                         SIF
          Who else could elude Heimdall's
          gaze with tricks of light and
          shadow?

                         VOLSTAGG
          The ceremony was interrupted just
          before Thor was named King.

                         SIF
          We should go to the Allfather.

                         FANDRAL
          And tell him what? "Oh, by the
          way, we think your son just
          betrayed the throne. And do us a
          favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
          good fellow!"

                         SIF
          It's our duty. If any of our
          suspicions are right, then all of
          Asgard is in danger.

          54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54

          Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
          sitting on its stand.
          He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
          between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
          blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
          The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
          Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
          metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
          the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.

           ODIN (O.S.)
          Stop!
          Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
          goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
          Odin eyes Loki with dismay.

                         LOKI
          Am I cursed?

                         ODIN
          No. Put the Casket down.
          Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
          returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
          father.

                         LOKI
          What am I?

                         ODIN
          You're my son.

                         LOKI
          What more than that?
          Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
          Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The Casket wasn't the only thing
          you took from Jotunheim that day,
          was it?
          Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

                         ODIN
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          In the aftermath of the battle, I
          went into the Temple, and I found a
          baby. Small for a giant's
          offspring -- abandoned, suffering,
          left to die. Laufey's son.
          Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.

                         LOKI
          Laufey's son...
          He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
          blood. Why would you take me?

                         ODIN
          You were an innocent child.

                         LOKI
          You took me for a purpose, what was
          it?
          Odin doesn't answer.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Tell me!

                         ODIN
          I thought we could unite our
          kingdoms one day, bring about an
          alliance, bring about a permanent
          peace... through you. But those
          plans no longer matter.

                         LOKI
          So I am no more than another stolen
          relic, locked up here until you
          might have use of me.

                         ODIN
          Why do you twist my words?

                         LOKI
          You could have told me what I was
          from the beginning. Why didn't
          you?

                         ODIN
          You are my son. My blood. I
          wanted only to protect you from the
          truth.

                         LOKI
          Because I am the monster parents
          tell their children about at night?

                         ODIN
          Don't...

                         LOKI
          It all makes sense now. Why you
          favored Thor all these years.

                         ODIN
          Listen...

                         LOKI
          Because no matter how much you
          claim to "love" me, you could never
          have a Frost Giant sitting on the
          Throne of Asgard!
          Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
          move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of
          the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries
          to fight it off.

                         ODIN
          Listen to me!
          Loki strides away towards the exit.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Loki!
          Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
          and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
          The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
          now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
          trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
          Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
          scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
          Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,
          calls out.

          Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the
          sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.

          59 EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 59

          It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
          lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
          watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
          line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
          One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
          the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
          effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
          cell phones.
          They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
          PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
          TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
          from the back of the truck.
          He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
          the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

                         EAGER TOWNIE
          This'll do it.
          He yells to the driver.

          Okay, let 'er rip!
          The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then
          STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear
          of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off
          and go flying.
          People dive out of the way.
          The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"
          LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party
          continuing. They don't notice as --

          ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
          An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in
          a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering
          below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
          crater.
          He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object
          which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He
          pulls out a phone.

                         COULSON

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Sir -- we've found it.

          60 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 60

          In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks
          around for a t-shirt.
          Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
          his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,
          rippling biceps.

                         DARCY
          You know, for a crazy homeless guy,
          he's pretty cut.
          Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
          t-shirt.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Hey, sorry I tased you!
          Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
          equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
          stop to it.

                         JANE
          Excuse me... excuse me!
          She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
          t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
          "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE". Thor looks at it,
          puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52.

           JANE (CONT'D)
          My ex.
          Thor stares at her a beat.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          They're the only clothes I had
          that'll fit you. Sorry.

                         THOR
          They will suffice.
          Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
          the wall.

                         JANE
          You're welcome. Now tell me...
          Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
          his form in the Bifrost photo.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What were you doing, in that?
          He glances at it, dismissive.

                         THOR
          What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
          Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
          Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
          moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
          the book, curious.

                         SELVIG
          (amused, skeptical)
          The Bifrost...
          Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
          to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the
          book.

                         JANE
          What exactly is the Bifrost?

                         THOR

                         (IGNORING HER)
          This mortal form has grown weak.

                         JANE

                         BUT--

          61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61

          Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
          lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
          space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
          walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
          him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
          Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
          softly to him.

                         FRIGGA
          I asked him to be honest with you
          from the beginning. There should
          be no secrets in a family.

                         LOKI
          So why did he lie?

                         FRIGGA
          He kept the truth from you so that
          you would never feel different.
          You are in every way our son, Loki,
          and we your family. You must know
          that.
          Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)

                         (RE: ODIN)
          You can speak to him. He can see
          and hear us, even now.

                         LOKI
          How long will it last?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.

                         FRIGGA
          I don't know. This time is
          different. We were unprepared.

                         LOKI
          I never get used to seeing him like
          this. The most powerful being in
          the Nine Realms lying helpless
          until his body is restored.

                         FRIGGA
          But he's put it off for so long
          now, I fear...
          Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
          eyes.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          You're a good son.
          Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
          really feels.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          We mustn't lose hope that your
          father will return to us. And your
          brother.
          Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

                         LOKI
          What hope is there for Thor?

                         FRIGGA
          There's always a purpose to
          everything your father does. Thor
          may yet find a way home.
          Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
          the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
          hurriedly approaching.

          THE EINHERJAR GUARD
          Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
          the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
          baffled.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor is banished. The line of
          succession falls to you. Until he
          awakens, Asgard is yours.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A.
          The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
          EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
          before Loki, offers the spear to him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Make your father proud.
          Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
          feel of it in his hand.

          62 INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62

          Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local
          diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a
          huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
          pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
          Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

                         JANE
          Now tell us exactly what happened
          to you last night.
          Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
          flustered, looks away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Maybe start with how you got inside
          that cloud.

                         DARCY
          And how you could eat an entire box
          of Pop-Tarts and still be this
          hungry.
          Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
          coffee.

                         THOR
          (re: coffee mug)
          This drink. I like it.

                         DARCY
          (to Thor, re: coffee)
          Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
          Isabela makes the best coffee in
          town.
          Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

                         THOR

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Another!
          ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
          from behind the counter.

                         JANE
          Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Yo voy a pagar la taza.
          Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in
          Spanish.

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Did you see that? The first time
          she brings a man in here, and he's
          a lunatic!

                         JANE
          (to Thor, re: mug)
          What was that?
          He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

                         THOR
          It was delicious. I want another.

                         JANE
          Then you should just say so!

                         THOR
          I just did.

                         JANE
          I mean ask for it. Nicely.

                         THOR
          I meant no disrespect.

                         JANE
          All right, then no more smashing,
          deal?

                         THOR
          You have my word.

                         JANE
          Good.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55.
          A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
          the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them
          is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

                         ISABELA
          Morning, Pete. Jake.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          The usual, please, Izzy.
          Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          You missed all the excitement out
          at the crater.

                         ISABELA
          What crater?
          Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
          Townies with interest.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          They're saying some kind of
          satellite crashed in the desert.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          We were having a good time with it
          till the Feds showed up, chased us
          out.

                         JANE
          (to the Townies)
          Excuse me, did you say there was a
          satellite crash?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          Yep. They said it was radioactive.
          And I had my hands all over it.

                         (REALIZING)
          I'm probably sterile now.
          Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
          pancakes. Darcy is amazed by the sight.

                         DARCY
          Oh my God, this is going on
          Facebook.
          Darcy whips out her cellphone.

          DARCY (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Smile!

          Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his
          massive stack of food.

                         SELVIG
          (to the Townies)
          What did the satellite look like?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          I don't know nothing about
          satellites. But it was heavy.
          Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.
          This gets Thor's attention.

          Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
          and pulls the Townie around to face him.

                         THOR
          Where?!

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          About twelve miles east of here.
          Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
          the diner.

                         PETE
          I wouldn't bother! Looked like the
          whole Army was coming in when we
          left!

          63 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63

          Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

                         JANE
          Where are you going?

                         THOR
          Twelve miles east of here.
          He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
          with him.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          To get what belongs to me.

                         JANE
          So now you own a satellite?

                         THOR
          It's not what they say it is.

                         JANE
          Whatever it is, the government
          seems to think it's theirs. You
          intend to just walk in there and
          take it?

                         THOR
          Yes.
          He stops walking.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          If you take me there now, I'll tell
          you everything you wish to know.

                         JANE
          Everything?

                         THOR
          All the answers you seek will be
          yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
          Darcy looks to the others.

          "Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?"
          Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,

                         WHEN:

                         SELVIG
          Jane.
          He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
          care for him.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JANE)
          Please don't do this.

                         JANE
          You know what we saw last night.
          This can't be a coincidence. I
          want to know what's in that crater.

                         SELVIG
          I'm not talking about the crater.
          I'm talking about him.

                         JANE
          He's promised us answers.

                         SELVIG
          He's delusional! Listen to what
          he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost."
          "Mjolnir." These are the stories I
          grew up with as a child!

                         JANE
          I'd just be driving him out there,
          that's all.

                         SELVIG
          It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
          After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
          Darcy.

                         JANE
          I'm sorry. I can't take you.

                         THOR
          I understand. Then this is where
          we say goodbye.
          He takes her hand and kisses it.

                         JANE
          That's... thank you.
          Thor bows slightly to each of them.

                         THOR
          Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...
          Darcy. Farewell.
          He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.

                         SELVIG
          Now... let's get back to the lab.
          We have work to do.
          Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
          as he walks away down the street.

          64 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 64

          Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne
          Room.

          65 INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 65

          Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors
          Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.

                         SIF
          Allfather, we must speak with you

                         URGENTLY--
          But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --

                         LOKI
          Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
          horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
          Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What is this?

                         LOKI
          My friends... you haven't heard? I
          am now Ruler of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Where is Odin?

                         LOKI
          Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
          My mother fears he may never awaken
          again.

                         SIF
          We would speak with her.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          She has refused to leave my
          father's bedside. You can bring
          your "urgent" matter to me, your
          King.
          Sif covers quickly.

                         SIF
          We would ask you to end Thor's
          banishment.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.

                         LOKI
          My first command can not be to undo
          the Allfather's last. We're on the
          brink of war with Jotunheim. Our
          people must have a sense of
          continuity in order to feel safe in
          these difficult times.
          Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
          this.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          All of us must stand together, for
          the good of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Of course.
          Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
          stares after them.

          66 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by
          Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped
          by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices,
          partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine
          from her lab.

                         JANE
          Hey! That's my stuff!

          66A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government
          vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the
          lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all
          the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
          Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with
          scientific instruments and documents.

                         JANE
          What the hell is going on here?!
          The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.

                         COULSON
          Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

          SHIELD.
          Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60A.

                         JANE
          I don't care who you work for, you
          can't do this!

                         SELVIG
          Jane. This is more serious than
          you realize. Let it go.

                         JANE
          Let it go?! This is my life!

                         COULSON
          We're here investigating a security
          threat. We need to appropriate
          your equipment and all your
          atmospheric data.

                         JANE
          By "appropriate" you mean "steal?"
          Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.

                         COULSON
          This should more than compensate
          you for your trouble.
          She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.

                         JANE
          I can't just pick up replacements
          from RadioShack! I made most of
          that equipment myself!

                         COULSON
          Then I'm sure you can do it again.

                         JANE
          And I'm sure I can sue you for
          violating my constitutional rights!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.

                         COULSON
          We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
          He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
          fully herself, fueled by outrage.

                         JANE
          So are we! We're on the verge of

                         UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
          extraordinary.
          Jane holds up her notebook.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Everything I know about this
          phenomenon is in this lab and in
          this book, and no one has the right
          to take it from me.
          Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
          notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's
          carrying. Jane is stunned.

                         COULSON
          Thank you for your cooperation.
          He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.

          67 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 67

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now-
          empty space.

                         JANE
          Years of research, gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.

                         DARCY
          They even took my iPod.

                         SELVIG
          And your back-ups?

                         JANE
          Look around! They took our back-
          ups. They took the back-ups of our
          back-ups.

                         DARCY
          I just downloaded, like, thirty
          songs on there.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          Will you please stop talking about
          your iPod?!

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Who are these people?

                         SELVIG
          No one knows much about them. But
          I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in
          gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up,
          and he was never heard from again.

                         JANE
          I'm not going to let them do this.
          I'm getting everything back.

                         SELVIG
          Please, let me contact one of my
          colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some
          dealings with these people. I'll e-
          mail him and see if he can help.

                         DARCY
          They took your laptop, too.
          Annoyed, Selvig thinks.

          67A EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 67A

          Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the
          town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE

          INTERNET."

                         SELVIG
          I'll just be a minute.
          He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
          and sees something that intrigues her.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62A.

          68 INT. PET STORE - DAY 68

          Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.

                         THOR
          I need a horse.

          PET STORE CLERK
          Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just
          dogs, cats, birds.

                         THOR
          Then give me one of those, large
          enough to ride.
          The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
          Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door.
          Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63.

                         JANE
          You still want a lift?

          68A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A

          It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book --
          "THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS" -- to a group of kids.

                         LIBRARIAN

                         (READING)
          "And though they're large, giants
          can be quiet. You have to listen
          carefully for the sound of their
          footsteps -- because they may be
          closer than you think."
          Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
          e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with
          interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
          pleasantly.

          LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
          Joshua, come sit down. It's story
          time.
          The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
          over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

          "MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."
          He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
          Scandinavian Mythology.
          It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
          earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
          THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
          of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
          He eyes the illustration, pondering.

                         69 OMITTED 69

          70 EXT. DESERT - DUSK 70

          Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged
          terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.

          71 INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 71

          Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as
          Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A.

                         JANE
          I've never done anything like this
          before! Have you ever done
          anything like this before?
          Thor looks amused by her excitement.

                         THOR
          Many times. You're brave to do it.

                         JANE
          They just stole my entire life's
          work. I really don't have anything
          left to lose.

                         THOR
          But you're clever. Far more clever
          than anyone else in this Realm.

                         JANE
          "This Realm?" Why do you talk like
          that?

                         THOR
          You think me strange?
          Jane laughs, catches herself.

                         JANE
          Yeah. Just a little.

                         THOR
          Good strange or bad strange?

                         JANE
          I'm not quite sure yet.
          She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
          gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly
          turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Who are you? Really?

                         THOR
          You'll see soon enough.

                         JANE
          You promised me answers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B.
          Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

                         THOR
          What you seek -- it's a bridge.

                         JANE
          A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge?

                         THOR
          More like a rainbow bridge.

          God, I hope you're not crazy.

          71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A

          As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside,
          revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move
          closer, we see the glow comes from --

          A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE
          Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,
          barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
          that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the
          complex.
          Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
          translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
          crater.
          Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
          Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
          Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
          work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
          center of it all -- Mjolnir.

          72 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72

          Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through
          binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.

                         JANE
          That isn't a satellite crash. They
          would have hauled the wreckage
          away, not built a city around it.
          Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.

                         THOR
          You're going to need this.

                         JANE
          Why?--
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
          takes his jacket.

                         THOR
          Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I
          will return what they stole from
          you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.
          He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his
          request.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Deal?

                         JANE
          No! Look what's down there! You
          can't just walk in, grab our stuff,
          and walk out!

                         THOR
          No.
          Jane looks relieved.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm going to fly out.
          Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
          The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.

                         JANE
          Wait...
          But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

          72A EXT. SHIELD BASE / INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE STRUCTURE 72A

          A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
          holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
          off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
          above.

                         CUT TO:

          73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73
          It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:

          74 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM 74

          A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors
          security. AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of
          junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.

                         TECHIE
          Feed from the keyhole. Can barely
          penetrate the cloud cover.
          The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
          static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a
          terrain map.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Tech's barely working as it is,
          with all the interference that
          thing's giving off.
          He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, we've got a commercial
          aircraft coming in right over us,
          Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.

                         SITWELL
          Reroute it, like all the others.

                         TECHIE
          Right. Can I get the passengers
          some free drinks for the trouble?
          Sitwell glares at him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)

                         (SHRUGS)
          It'd be a nice gesture.
          The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
          on another screen, holds up a hand.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hold a sec... we got something
          outside the fence, west side...
          He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a
          THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.

                         SITWELL
          (into a radio)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.

          74A EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 74A

          A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a
          jeep to investigate.

          74B EXT. SHIELD SECURITY ROOM 74B

          Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his
          attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is
          coming from the hammer containment area.

          75 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - FENCE - MOMENTS LATER 75

          The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a
          flashlight, see nothing unusual.

                         AGENT JACKSON

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Looks like we're good here. Must
          have been another coyote.
          Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been
          bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.
          Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING
          illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
          large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of
          the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

                         AGENT DELANCEY
          Jackson?
          The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
          across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
          slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
          shotgun at Thor.
          Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
          thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
          Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.

          75A INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 75A

          Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.

                         SITWELL

                         (INTO RADIO)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- report.

          76 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - MOMENTS LATER 76

          Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across
          the base.
          Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the
          unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his
          radio.

                         SHIELD AGENT
          Agents down! We've got a perimeter
          breach!

          77 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 77

          The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference.
          Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and
          the Techie watch the monitors warily.
          On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
          starts to crackle with energy.

                         SITWELL
          (to the Techie)
          Get Coulson.
          Sitwell punches an alarm.

          78 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 78

          As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and
          SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.

          78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A

          A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the
          ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.
          She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's
          recorded message.

          SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
          You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
          Please leave me a message.
          His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.

                         JANE
          Erik, okay, first of all, don't
          worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.
          More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          But if you don't hear from me
          again, you might want to come out
          to the crater site and look for me.
          I kind of did what you said I
          shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.
          She hangs up.

          79 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79

          Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches
          across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the
          lit up site uneasily.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67.

          80 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80

          A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
          the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
          As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
          rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
          ground.
          Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
          fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
          more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
          cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
          Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
          entrance tube to the center of the site.
          A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
          see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
          right on him.
          Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
          raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
          He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
          catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
          hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
          the ATV's spotlight.
          Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
          the wheel to protect himself.
          The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
          entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
          Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
          the site entrance.

          80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A

          The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
          the crater lip.
          The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
          straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
          inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
          tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
          The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
          it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

           Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied
           aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
           Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.

          Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain
          begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash.
          He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour.

          82C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE 82C

          As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor
          races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads
          inside.

          82D INT. ENTRANCE TUBE 82D

          Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS
          round the corner.
          Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
          hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
          ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
          backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
          Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
          Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through
          the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to
          tunnels to find a way towards it.

          82E EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 82E

          Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the
          Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor.
          Coulson activates his radio.

          As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him,
          on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to
          the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
          Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him
          into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
          Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
          give chase.

          distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside
          the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and
          heading towards the cube structure.

          BARTON (CONT'D)
          Hello, handsome.

          83A INT. TUNNEL 83A

          Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
          Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --
          whatever it takes to keep moving.
          As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
          box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
          He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the
          middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a
          fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him
          reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --

          A HUGE SHIELD AGENT
          The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
          in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.

                         THOR
           You're big.
          Thor grins.

           THOR (CONT'D)
           Fought bigger.

          83B EXT. JUNCTION BOX 83B

          Thor and the Huge Agent explode through the wall of the
          junction box, then crash into the mud, sending them sliding.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68A.

          83C EXT. CRANE BUCKET 83C

          Barton has Thor in his sites. The sniper stands still as a
          statue.

          83D INT. TUNNEL 83D

          Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to
          Barton, when he stops short. He sees what looks like an
          electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,
          directly above the crater... and the hammer.

          83E EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 83E

          Jane sees SHIELD Agents and Guards swarming into the cube
          containment structure.

                         JANE
          No...

          84 EXT. CRATER 84

          Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
          Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor
          sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking
          his view.
          Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,
          whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
          the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
          Thor's momentum carries him past.
          Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge
          Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down
          at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into
          the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,
          defeated.
          Thor races back towards the structure.

          84H INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84H

          From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the
          structure.
          He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
          His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
          around it.
          Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
          one story up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68B.
          As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
          brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
          crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
          his interest piqued.
          Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane
          bucket comes into view.

          84I EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84I

          Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle
          site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the
          trigger.

          84J INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84J

          Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches
          out to it confidently.
          Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
          him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then
          radios Barton.

                         COULSON
          Barton...

          84K EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84K

          Barton stands ready to take Thor down. His finger starts to
          squeeze the trigger.

          COULSON (V.O., ON RADIO)
          ...hold your fire.
          Barton releases the trigger, pulls up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69.

          84L INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84L

          Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
          around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
          hammer doesn't move.
          Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
          -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
          his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
          and lightning above him.
          Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
          RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
          But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
          knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
          runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
          Coulson looks on, disappointed.
          SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
          Coulson activates his radio.

                         COULSON
          Ground units, move in. Show's
          over.
          As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
          care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
          rain -- a man broken, lost.
          From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
          room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
          to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
          damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

          86 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 86

          Jane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad
          to worse.
          She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him.
          Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears
          the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the
          glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.
          With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.

          Heimdall stands at his post, watching the scene. He lowers
          his head.

          88 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 88

          Jane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab.
          Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library,
          looks through it.

                         JANE
          I can't just leave him there.

          Why not?

                          JANE
          You didn't see what happened.
          Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.

                         DARCY
          Hey! Myeu-muh!
          Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig
          knowingly.

                         JANE

                         (RE: BOOK)
          Where did you find this?
          Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.

                         SELVIG
          In the children's section. I
          wanted to show you how ridiculous
          his story was.
          Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.

                         JANE
          Aren't you the one who's always
          told me to chase down all leads,
          all possibilities?

                         SELVIG
          I was talking about science, not
          magic!

                         JANE
          Magic's just science we don't
          understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.

                         SELVIG
          Who wrote science fiction.

                         JANE
          The precursor of science fact.

                         SELVIG
          In some cases.

                         JANE
          If that's really an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge out there, then there's
          something on the other side.

          through it before.

                         SELVIG
          Jane...

                         DARCY
          A primitive culture like the
          Vikings might have worshipped them
          as deities.
          They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly
          insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her,
          grateful for the support.

                         JANE
          Yes! Exactly! Thank you!
          Darcy beams.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, if you do this, you'll find
          yourself in a situation that I
          won't be able to get you out of
          this time.

                         DARCY
          I'll help you.
          Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no
          stopping her. He sighs.

          89 INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 89

          Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed
          behind him. Coulson stands across from him.

                         COULSON
          It's not easy to do what you did.
          You made us all look like a bunch
          of mall cops. That's hurtful.

                         (THEN)
          The men you so easily subdued are
          highly-trained professionals, and
          in my experience, it takes someone
          who's received similar training to
          do what you did to them. Would you
          like to tell me where you received
          your training?
          Thor sits silently.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
          Then again, you strike me more as
          the soldier of fortune type. What
          was it, South Africa?
          Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Certain groups pay well for a good
          mercenary. Especially HYDRA.
          Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Who are you?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72.

                         THOR
          Just a man.

                         COULSON
          One way or another, we find out
          what we want to know. We're good
          at that.
          Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.

          LOKI (O.S.)
          I thought he'd never leave.
          Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
          in 21st century attire.

                         THOR
          Loki? What are you doing here?

                         LOKI
          I had to see you.

                         THOR
          What's happened? Tell me! Is it
          Jotunheim? Let me explain to

                         FATHER--

                         LOKI
          Father is dead.
          Thor stares at him, stunned.

                         THOR
          What?

                         LOKI
          Your banishment, the threat of a
          new war, it was too much for him to
          bear.
          The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
          responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
          looks in his eyes, consolingly.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You mustn't blame yourself. I know
          that you loved him. I tried to
          tell him so, but he wouldn't
          listen.

           LOKI (CONT'D)

                         (THEN)
          It was cruel to put the hammer
          within your reach, knowing you
          could never lift it.
          Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The burden of the throne has fallen
          to me now.

                         THOR
          Can I come home?

                         LOKI
          The truce with Jotunheim is
          conditional upon your exile.

                         THOR
          But couldn't we find a way to--

                         LOKI
          Mother has forbidden your return.
          Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
          sorry.

                         THOR
          No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you
          for coming here.

                         LOKI
          Nothing could have stopped me.
          Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fare well, brother.

                         THOR
          Good-bye.

                         COULSON
          Good-bye? I just got back.
          Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Now. Where did we leave off?

          Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
          Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
          the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
          do it?
          He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
          go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
          He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
          from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.

          91 INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 91

          Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.

          "Donald Blake?"

                         SELVIG
          Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
          our team.

                         COULSON
          You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
          Selvig.

                         SELVIG
          Troubled, not dangerous. He was
          distraught when he found out that
          you'd taken all of our research.
          It was years of his life, gone! He
          got depressed, started drinking,
          and... well, you know the rest.

                         COULSON
          Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
          moment to verify his identity?

                         SELVIG
          Certainly.
          The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          You can understand how a man could
          go off like that. I mean, a big,
          faceless organization like yours,
          coming in with their jack-booted
          thugs and stealing private
          property...

                         (THEN)
          ...is how he described it.

                         COULSON
          That doesn't explain how he managed
          to tear through our security.
          Selvig shrugs.

                         SELVIG
          Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
          nut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A.
          On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
          York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo
          is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
          cellphone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
          The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
          SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS." Coulson eyes the screen.
          After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          It says here he's an M.D.

                         SELVIG
          He is. That is, he was. He
          switched careers and became a
          physicist. He's quite brilliant,
          really.

                         (THEN)
          If you would just release him to
          me, I promise to keep an eye on
          him.
          Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
          an AGENT nearby.

                         COULSON
          Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
          here.
          The Techie looks to him, surprised.

          COULSON (CONT'D)

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Make sure he stays in town for the
          next few days in case we need to
          talk to him again.
          Selvig shakes his hand.

                         SELVIG
          Thank you.

          92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A

          Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
          seated Thor.

                         SELVIG
          Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
          are!
          Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
          pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          It's going to be all right, my
          friend. Come on, I'm taking you
          home.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A.
          He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

          92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B

          As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
          Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
          Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
          written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
          it from the pile and pockets it.

          92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C

          Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
          record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
          "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA." He knows it's been a ruse
          all along.
          He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
          Room, then follows them outside.

          93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93

          Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
          away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          Just keep him away from the bars.

                         SELVIG
          I will!

                         THOR

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where are we going?
          Selvig drops his cool demeanor.

                         SELVIG
          To get a drink.
          Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
          As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
          GARRETT and CALE.

                         COULSON
          Follow them.

          94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94

          Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
          surface of the planet.

          95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95

          Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
          light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
          Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
          Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

                         LAUFEY
          Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

                         LOKI
          I've come alone and unarmed.

                         LAUFEY
          To what end?

                         LOKI
          To make you another proposition.

                         LAUFEY

                         (REALIZING)
          So you're the one who let us into
          Asgard.

                         LOKI
          You're welcome.

                         LAUFEY
          My men are dead, and I have no
          Casket. You are a deceiver.
          Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
          calmly stands his ground.

                         LOKI
          You have no idea what I am.
          The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
          guards stare in shock. Loki grins.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Hello, Father.
          Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
          Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.

                         LAUFEY
          Ah, the bastard son. I thought
          Odin had killed you. That's what I
          would have done. He's as weak as
          you are.

                         LOKI
          No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
          until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
          should not have so carelessly
          abandoned me.
          This gives Laufey pause.

                         LAUFEY
          Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
          I've ever made. I will hear you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.

                         LOKI
          I will conceal you and a handful of
          your soldiers, lead you into his
          chambers, and let you slay him
          where he lies. I'll keep the
          throne, and you will have the
          Casket.
          Laufey studies Loki's face.

                         LAUFEY
          Why would you do this?

                         LOKI
          When all is done, we will have a
          permanent peace between our two
          worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
          will have accomplished what Odin
          and Thor never could.

                         LAUFEY
          This is a great day for Jotunheim.
          Asgard is finally ours.

                         LOKI
          No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
          the Nine Realms will be yours, if
          you do as you're told.
          Laufey considers the proposition.

                         LAUFEY
          I accept.
          Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
          smile crosses his face.

          96 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96

          Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
          his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.

                         HEIMDALL
          I turned my gaze upon you in
          Jotunheim, but could neither see
          nor hear you. You were shrouded
          from me, like the Frost Giants who
          entered this Realm.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps your senses have weakened
          after your many years of service.

                         HEIMDALL
          Or perhaps someone has found a way
          to hide that which he does not wish
          me to see.
          Loki sizes him up, smiles.

                         LOKI
          You have great power, Heimdall.
          Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

                         HEIMDALL
          No.

                         LOKI
          And why is that?

                         HEIMDALL
          Because he is my King, and I am
          sworn to obey him.

                         LOKI
          Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
          obey me now. Yes?
          A beat.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         LOKI
          Good. Then you will open the
          Bifrost to no one until I have
          undone what my brother has started.
          Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A.

          97 INT. BAR - NIGHT 97

          Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
          The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots
          of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
          Thor follows his example.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.

                         SELVIG
          Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
          but a talented hacker.

                         THOR
          Thank you for what you've done.

                         SELVIG
          Don't thank me. I only did it for 
          Jane.

                         THOR
          Are you in love with her?

                         SELVIG
          Of course not! Jane's like a
          daughter to me. Her father and I
          taught at University together. A
          good man, but he never listened.
          This registers with Thor.

                         THOR
          Neither did I.
          Selvig eyes him with interest.

                         SELVIG
          I don't know if you're really 
          delusional, and I really don't care 
          at this point. I just care about 
          her. I've seen the way she looks
          at you.

                         THOR
          I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

                         SELVIG
          Good. If that's the case, then
          I'll buy you one more drink, and 
          you'll leave town tonight. 
          A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.

                         THOR
          I had it all backwards. I had it
          all wrong.
          Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
          he's seen before.

                         SELVIG
          It's not a bad thing, finding out
          that you don't have all the
          answers. That's when you start
          asking the right questions.
          Thor takes this in.

                         THOR
          For the first time in my life, I
          have no idea what I'm supposed to
          do. 

                         SELVIG
          Anyone who's ever going to find 
          their way in this world has to
          start by admitting they don't know
          where the hell they are.
          Thor nods.

          DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
          Hey, I know you, man... 
          An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one 
          of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
          approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          You were in the diner with that hot 
          girl.
          Thor doesn't like where this is going. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't mind her doing a little
          research on me.
          He laughs. Thor is annoyed. 

                         THOR
          I have no quarrel with you. But 
          she's a lady. You should be more 
          respectful.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.

                          DRUNK TOWNIE
           And you should shut the hell up, 
           princess.
           Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
           But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's 
          baiting. 

                          THOR 
           I will not fight him. 

                          DRUNK TOWNIE 
           Then it'll be easy to kick your 
           ass. 
           Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

                          SELVIG
           Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
           heads. 
          Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
          Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
          glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Another drink?

          98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98

          Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
          FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
          routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
          in time with the song.

                         THOR/SELVIG

                         (SINGING)
          "The mood is good, our hearts are
          full, there's magic in the air. /
          It's all because we're here
          tonight, and haven't got a care. /
          So raise a glass, and toast to
          life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
          la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
          indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
          friend is fine indeed!"
          Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
          Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
          straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
          WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
          Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
          walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.

          99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99

          The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
          with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
          lies on her bed, trying to read.
          She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
          the door and opens it to find --

                         THOR
          Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
          shoulder.

                         JANE
          Erik!

                         (TO THOR)
          Is he all right?

                         THOR
          He's fine. Not injured at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A.
          As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
          Selvig GROANS.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry, my friend.

                         JANE
          What happened?

                         THOR
          We drank. We fought. He made his
          ancestors proud.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.

                         JANE
          Put him on the bed.
          Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
          bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
          way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
          awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.

                         SELVIG
          I still don't believe you're the
          God of Thunder.

                         (THEN)
          But you ought to be.
          Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
          sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
          Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
          Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.

                         THOR
          These are your chambers?
          Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
          the mess around her.

                         JANE
          Well, it's more of a temporary
          living space, really. I don't
          usually have visitors in here.
          Actually, never...
          Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
          him, puts it away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Can we go outside?

          100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100

          Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
          offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
          up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

                         JANE
          I come up here sometimes when I
          can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
          reconcile particle data. Or when
          Darcy's driving me crazy.

                         (THEN)
          I come up here a lot, now that I
          think about it.
          Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're safe.

                         THOR
          You've been very kind. I've been
          far less grateful than you deserve.

                         JANE
          I also hit you with my car a couple
          times, so it kind of evens out.
          He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her

          NOTEBOOK.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I don't believe it...
          She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.

                         THOR
          It was all I could get back. Not
          as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

                         JANE
          No, this is good. Thank you. This
          means I don't have to start from
          scratch...
          She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
          harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

                         THOR
          What's wrong?

                         JANE
          SHIELD, whatever they are. They're
          never going to let this research
          see the light of day.

                         THOR
          You must do this. You must finish
          what you've started.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          Because you're right. It's taken
          so many generations for your people
          to get to this point. You're
          nearly there. You just need
          someone to show you how close you
          really are.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.
          Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page
          which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from
          the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one
          point to another in space.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Look -- your ancestors called it
          magic. You call it science. I
          come from a place where they're one
          and the same thing.
          We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
          as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.

                         JANE
          What is it?

                         THOR
          This is how my father explained it
          to me...

                         (THEN)
          Your world is one of the Nine
          Realms of the Cosmos, linked to
          each other by the branches of
          Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,
          you see it every day, without
          realizing. Images glimpsed through
          -- what did you call it?...
          (checks her notebook)
          ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine
          Realms...
          They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is
          going to be a long night.

          101 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101

          Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He
          stares up at the night sky.
          She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
          looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at
          the town beyond her.

          102 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102

          Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands
          nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously
          as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can
          stand it no more.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.

                         FANDRAL
          Our dearest friend banished, Loki
          on the throne, Asgard on the brink
          of war, yet you manage to consume
          four wild boar, six pheasant, a
          side of beef, and two casks of ale.
          Shame on you! Don't you care?!
          Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
          pulls his weapon, stopping him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Do not mistake my appetite for
          apathy.

                         SIF
          Stop it, both of you! We all know
          what we have to do, we're just too
          damned afraid to do it!

                         HOGUN

                         (DECIDES)
          We must go. We must find Thor.
          Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
          fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.

                         FANDRAL
          It's treason, Hogun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          To hell with treason, it's suicide.

                         (SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
          Now, shh! Heimdall may be
          watching! It's said he can hear--

                         FANDRAL
          Yes, yes, we know!

                         SIF
          Thor would do the same for us.
          An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          Heimdall demands your presence.
          Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We're doomed.

          103 EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING 103

          Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.

          104 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - DAY 104

          Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled
          against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85.
          He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

          105 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 105

          Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig
          emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane.
          Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:

                         SELVIG
          I need some coffee.
          The three head inside Smith Motors.

          FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
          SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a
          small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

          105A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 105A

          Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor
          holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She
          scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the
          table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

                         DARCY
          Thanks.

                         THOR
          You're very welcome.
          Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
          She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their
          breakfast, looking like a little family.

                         106 OMITTED 106

           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86.

          108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108

          On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett
          and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their
          wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window
          with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link,
          turns to Cale.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          They want an update.

                         AGENT CALE
          Tell them he's eating eggs.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Scrambled or fried?
          Cale glares at him.

                         AGENT CALE

                         (INTO COMM-LINK)
          Target is eating eggs, sir.
          We'll keep you posted.

          108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA

          As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his
          hand, gets an idea.

                         THOR

                         (RE: MUG)
          May I have this?

                         DARCY
          Sure.

                         THOR
          Thank you. Excuse me a moment.
          Thor leaves.

          108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A

          In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
          (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop
          tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch.
          She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him
          suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.

                         THOR
          To replace the one I broke. Please
          forgive my behavior.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A.
          She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

                         ISABEL
          Okay. Thank you.

                         THOR
          If I may, I'd like to come back for
          more of your "coffee."

                         ISABEL
          Any time.
          He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and
          shrugs.

          ISABEL (CONT'D)
          She could do worse.

          109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109

          Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the
          intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's
          controls. He glares at them accusingly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Good Heimdall, less us explain--

                         HEIMDALL
          You would defy the commands of Loki
          our King, break every oath you have
          taken as warriors, and commit
          treason to bring Thor back?
          The four exchange nervous glances.

                         SIF
          Yes, but--

                         HEIMDALL
          Good.
          The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

                         VOLSTAGG
          So you'll help us?

                         HEIMDALL
          I am bound by honor to our King. I
          cannot open the Bifrost to you.
          With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
          The others exchange puzzled looks.

          Complicated fellow, isn't he?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Now what do we do?
          Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.

                         SIF
          Look!
          The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
          control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally.
          Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

          110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110

          Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite
          footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

                         COULSON
          What the hell was that?

                         TECHIE
          I don't know, sir. We got massive
          energy readings out of nowhere,
          then they just disappeared.
          Fifteen miles due northwest.

                         COULSON
          Let's go take a look.

          111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111

          Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and
          Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They
          clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the
          hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes
          cover the desert sand around them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          He must have landed nearby. It's
          time to put our tracking skills to
          work. Spread out. Check the sand
          for indentations of his boot
          prints.

                         FANDRAL
          The winds would have blown them
          away by now. We should look for
          signs of a campfire.

                         SIF
          Or we could just start there.
          She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
          distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to
          Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg
          and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.

                         FANDRAL
          It's worth a look, I suppose.
          The party tromps towards the town.

          112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112

           Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as
           they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

          113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113

           A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He
           runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
           of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
           dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
           up with one hand. 

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88.
           Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
           hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. 

                          VOLSTAGG 
           There you go, lad!
           The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head 
          off.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Is it just me, or does Earth look a
          little different to you?

                         SIF
          It has been a thousand years...

                         VOLSTAGG
          Things change so fast here. You
          leave for a millennium, and it's
          like the whole neighborhood's gone.
          Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Perhaps we should split up.

          Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
          down the street.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Is there a Renaissance Faire in
          town?

                         AGENT CALE
          Call it in.
          But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
          their heads together. They're out.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Never cared for spies.
          He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
          ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a
          bite. He likes what he tastes.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Exquisite.

          115 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 115

          Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an
          Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          My liege, the Warriors Three and
          the Lady Sif have gone missing.
          Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.

          116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116

          Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

                         HEIMDALL
          Tell me, Loki, how did you get the
          Jotuns into Asgard?

                         LOKI
          You think the Bifrost is the only
          way in and out of the Realm? There
          are secret paths between worlds to
          which even you with all your gifts
          are blind. But I have need of them
          no longer, now that I am King.

                         (THEN)
          And I say, for your act of treason,
          you are relieved of your duties as
          Gatekeeper. And you are no longer
          a citizen of Asgard.

                         HEIMDALL
          Then I need no longer obey you.
          Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
          Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of
          something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it
          quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --

          THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.
          The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki
          opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
          From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
          the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
          SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
          towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
          still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
          Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
          massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,
          just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of
          relief and steps past him.

          117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117

          Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and
          opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER
          appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns
          its head toward its King.

                         LOKI
          Ensure my brother does not return.

          118 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 118

           Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying
           up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and
          utensils away.
          The door opens.

           VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
           Found you!
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

          SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE
          Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying
          dishes in mortal clothing.
          Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.

          Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the
          room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with
          wonder.

                         SELVIG

          the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and
          I, Volstagg the Svelte?
          Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Well, perhaps I've put on a little
          more muscle since I was here last.

                         JANE 
          That would have been a thousand 
          years ago? Northern Europe? 

                         VOLSTAGG 
          Exactly! Those lovely herring 
          people. They worshipped us! 
          Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.

                         THOR
          My friends, I've never been happier 
          to see anyone. But you should not
          have come.

                         FANDRAL
          We're here to take you home.
          Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

                         THOR
          You know I can't. My father is 
          dead because of me. I must remain
          in exile.
          The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

                         SIF
          Thor... your father still lives.
          Thor reacts to the revelation.

          A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few
          SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
          Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an
          Agent.

          Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost
          storm ROARS in the sky above.
          Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their
          vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in
          strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and
          the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the
          desert floor.
          Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

          Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.

          From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at
          the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it
          moves towards them.

                         SHIELD AGENT

                         (RE: DESTROYER)

          As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
          from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return
          fire.

          123 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 123

          Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in
          the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as
          Thor turns to Jane.

                         THOR
          Leave this town now. Get yourself
          and your friends to safety.

          oncoming threat.

          127 EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - DAY 127

          A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in
          front of it. Then we see it --

                         THE DESTROYER
          Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from
          within it.
          It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting
          storefronts aflame.

                         128 OMITTED 128

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96.

          129 EXT. STREET 129

          Sif and the Warriors Three head down the street towards the
          Destroyer.

                         SIF
          Keep him distracted.
          She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the
          behemoth.

                         FANDRAL
          What do you think? "The
          Svartalfheim Twist?" "Kiss of the
          Hag?" "Face Full of Boot?"
          Volstagg grins eagerly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          "The Flying Mountain."
          Hogun and Fandral groan.

                         FANDRAL
          Not "The Flying Mountain!" It
          threw out my back for a year last
          time!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Trust me, it'll work.

          130 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 130

          Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the Warriors
          Three get into position before the Destroyer.

                         THOR

                         (TO JANE)
          My friends fight bravely, but they
          won't be able to hold it back much
          longer.
          Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many
          animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.

          DOWN THE STREET
          Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as
          Volstagg stands limbering up.

                         FANDRAL

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          Come on!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A.
          Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
          As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him
          on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the
          voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.

                         VOLSTAGG
          For Asgaaaaard!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97.
          The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
          SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
          work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
          lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
          apologetically.
          The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
          smashing into them, when --

                         SIF
          Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
          plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
          The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
          faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
          brief moment of hope.
          But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
          again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
          Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
          degrees to face its attackers.
          The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
          of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
          rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
          staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
          Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
          unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
          in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
          free, landing in the middle of the street.

          131 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131

          Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
          time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
          A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
          and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
          they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
          impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

                         JANE
          Erik!
          She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going
          into shock.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO JANE)
          Go! Leave me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98.
          Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
          stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
          for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
          pouch and races back.
          He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
          useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.

                         THOR
          Come on... give me one!
          Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
          intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
          the end of the iron rod.

                         JANE
          What are you doing? What is that?
          As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
          Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
          piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
          reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
          completely.
          Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
          lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
          reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
          flesh.

                         SELVIG
          (to Jane, re: Thor)
          I'm really starting to like him.
          Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.

          132 EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132

          Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
          the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

                         THOR
          Go, while you can!

                         SIF
          But the others...

                         THOR
          You can't help them now. Your job
          is to survive.
          She struggles to sit up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.

                         SIF
          No! I will die a warrior's death.
          Stories will be told of this day--
          He gently takes her shield from her.

                         THOR
          Live and tell those stories
          yourself.
          At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
          with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
          towards them.
          Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
          safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
          and Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)

                         (RE: VOLSTAGG)
          Get him out of here!

                         FANDRAL
          No. We can still fight!

                         THOR
          But not win. Move Volstagg, or
          he'll die!
          Thor looks at them, grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, my friends. I have a
          plan.
          The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
          drag him away from the battlefield.
          After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
          tosses Sif's shield aside.
          He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
          defenseless.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Brother... for whatever I have done
          to wrong you, whatever I have done
          to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
          But these people have done nothing
          to you. They are innocents.
          He continues towards the Destroyer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Take my life, and know I will never
          return to Asgard.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
          Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
          The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
          swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
          of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
          Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
          Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
          The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
          a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
          Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, no!
          He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
          watching the scene --

          133 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 133

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
          A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100.

          134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134

          Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
          Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
          him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
          unleash its fiery blast.

          135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135

          Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
          burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
          hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
          vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
          Clouds form in the sky above.
          Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
          straight up into the air like a rocket.

          136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136

          The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

          KRAKAKABOOM!
          A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
          colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
          massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
          enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

                         JANE
          Oh. My. God.

          THE MIGHTY THOR
          Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
          the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
          down onto the ground.

          KRAKABOOM!
          Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
          Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
          Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
          God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
          force winds.
          Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
          Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
          It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
          locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
          straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
          Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
          overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
          Destroyer.
          Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
          The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
          within him, firing out of all his openings.
          Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
          heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
          Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
          lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
          pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
          skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
          Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
          A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

                         COULSON
          Donald... I don't think you've been
          completely honest with me.

          137 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 137

          Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in
          the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
          Darcy turns to Volstagg.

                         DARCY
          So, how can you speak our language?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Your language? Ha! Silly girl,
          you're speaking ours.
          Thor calls up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!

          138 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 138

          Heimdall stands frozen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102.

          139 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 139

          Thor looks to the others with concern.

                         THOR
          He would open it if he could. I
          fear the worst.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Then we're trapped here forever.

                         FANDRAL
          Then I suppose we'd best start
          settling into our new lives.
          He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Are all earth maidens as fair as
          you?
          Darcy enjoys the attention.

                         DARCY
          No.
          Thor shouts back up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall!

          140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140

          From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
          Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
          all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
          a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
          Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
          Observatory.

          141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141

          The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD
          Agent's machine gun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Primitive. Good enough for hunting
          small game, I suppose.
          Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
          grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.

                         FANDRAL
          Sorry, my love. These things
          happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103.
          He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
          Coulson.

                         THOR
          Know this, son of Coul. You and I,
          we fight for the same cause -- the
          protection of this world. From
          this day forward, count me as your
          ally.

                         (THEN)
          If you return the items you have
          stolen from Jane Foster.

                         COULSON
          Not stolen. Borrowed.
          Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          You'll get your equipment back.
          You're going to need it to continue
          your research... which, after
          today's events, SHIELD would like
          to fully sponsor. If that's all
          right with you.
          Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at
          him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him
          again.

                         THOR
          Whatever fate lies before me, you
          are part of it.
          He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and
          the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

          142 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 142

          The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall
          slumped over his controls.

                         THOR
          (to the others)
          Get him to the healing room! Leave
          my brother to me.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104.
          Thor bolts out the door.

          143 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 143

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
          the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
          grabs a sword.
          A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
          cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
          Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
          Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

          144 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 144

          Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the
          palace.

          145 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 145

          The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing
          the moment.
          He forms an ICE BLADE.

          146 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 146

          Thor races through the entrance to the palace.

          147 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 147

          Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.

                         LAUFEY
          It's said you can still see and
          hear what transpires around you,
          even in this state. I hope it's
          true, so that you may know your
          death came by the hand of Laufey.
          He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

          A BLAST OF ENERGY
          Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
          we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
          Gungnir.

                         LOKI
          And your death came by the son of
          Odin.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A.
          Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for
          Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall,
          taking him out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105.
          The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly,
          his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

                         REVEALING --

                         FRIGGA
          Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She
          looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I swear to you, mother, they will
          pay for what they've done today. I
          will end the Jotun threat, now and
          forever!
          He looks to Odin.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          And I will make you proud.
          Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
          in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
          and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
          respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor!
          She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
          on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

                         LOKI
          Found its way back to you, did it?

                         THOR
          No thanks to you.
          Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.

                         FRIGGA
          What?

                         THOR
          Why don't you tell her? How you
          sent the Destroyer to kill our
          friends? To kill me?
          Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.

                         LOKI
          It must have been enforcing
          Father's last command.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.

                         THOR
          You're a talented liar, brother.
          Always have been.

                         LOKI

                         (SMILES)
          It's good to have you back.

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
          destroy Jotunheim.
          Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
          Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber
          walls, into...

          148 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - CORRIDOR 148

          Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the
          opposite side of the corridor, to...

          149 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 149

          Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting
          pools below.

          150 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 150

          Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then
          quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.

          151 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 151

          Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret
          spins, points.

          152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152

          Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees
          the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He
          looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.

                         THOR
          Jotunheim...

          153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153

          Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost
          energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
          He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.

          154 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 154

          Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the
          Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A.
          He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an
          enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

                         LOKI
          All these years, and no one's ever
          dared to use it as a weapon.
          Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
          it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
          fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,
          blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the
          ice as Thor staggers to his feet.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You can't stop it. The Bifrost
          will build until it rips Jotunheim
          apart.

                         THOR
          Why have you done this?

                         LOKI
          To do what Father never could. To
          destroy their kind forever. When
          he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of
          what I've done.

                         THOR
          He won't! You can't kill an entire
          race!

                         LOKI
          What is this newfound love for the
          Frost Giants? You, who would have
          killed them all with your bare
          hands.

                         THOR
          I've changed.

                         LOKI
          So have I.
          Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fight me.
          He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his
          hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,
          but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
          towards the frozen controls.
          Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
          immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.

                         THOR
          Is the throne really worth what
          you've done? What you would
          become?

                         LOKI
          I never wanted the throne. I only
          wanted to be your equal. Now fight
          me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108.
          With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
          Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

                         THOR
          I will not fight you, brother.

                         LOKI
          I am not your brother. I never
          was.

                         THOR
          Loki, this is madness...
          Loki grins.

                         LOKI
          Is it?
          He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to
          his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          What happened to you on earth that
          turned you so soft? Don't tell me
          it was a woman.
          Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It was. Perhaps when we're
          finished here I'll pay her a little
          visit myself.
          That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and
          their weapons collide.
          The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and
          jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155

          It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of
          the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
          JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking
          ice.

          156 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 156

           Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the
           hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around
          it.

                          SELVIG
          Jane?

          157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
          Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
          hand.
          The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
          Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
          back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
          powerful.
          Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
          towards the Bifrost.

                         LOKI
          If you care so much for the Jotuns,
          then die with them.
          The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
          drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
          concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
          towards the Bifrost.
          MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
          The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
          blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
          brother.

          158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158

          Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
          land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
          to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

                         LOKI
          Thor! Help me!
          Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
          up at him desperately.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Please...
          Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
          brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
          then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
          around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
          Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
          him across the bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
          Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
          him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
          It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
          to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
          Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
          never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
          Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

                         LOKIS
          I was always more clever than you.

                         THOR
          Yet still not clever enough.
          With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
          summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
          channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
          Lokis.
          All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
          Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
          knocked from his grasp.
          Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
          back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
          away.
          Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
          confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
          his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
          pinned to the ground.
          Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
          towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
          do.
          Loki watches him smugly.

                         LOKI
          Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
          With all your strength, what good
          does it do you now?
          Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
          happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
          VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
          feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
          He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
          Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
          hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
          Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
          thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
          channels the power of the storm into it, then --
          He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
          massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
          the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
          where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Stop! What are you doing?!
          Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
          The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
          out from it. Loki thinks fast.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
          never see her again!
          Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
          through the back.

                         THOR
          Forgive me.
          Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
          Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
          sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
          KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
          out of it.
          Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
          the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
          Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
          The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
          As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
          Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
          towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
          from the broken Bridge.
          They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
          force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
          by the debris, when --

          A POWERFUL HAND
          Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
          as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

                         SEE --

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
          Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
          Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
          approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
          disappointment and regret.
          Loki lets go.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          No!
          But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
          falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
          him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
          Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
          Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
          into his father's arms.

                         ODIN
          It is over.

          159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
          The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
          in all directions.
          Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
          Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
          significance of what's just happened.

                         JANE
          It's gone.

          160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160

          A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
          sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
          Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
          their battle with the Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG
          ...and then, with a mighty bellow,
          I flew at the great metal beast and
          laid it low...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.

                         FANDRAL
          Is that another way of saying you
          fell on your huge a--

                         VOLSTAGG
          As a matter of fact, falling down
          was a tactic. Lulling the
          Destroyer into a false sense of
          security!

                         FANDRAL
          Well, I was the one who had to drag
          your enormous carcass off the
          battlefield. That makes me the
          real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
          Hogun points to Volstagg.

                         HOGUN
          Big stomach.
          (points to Fandral)
          Big mouth.
          The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
          look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
          smile.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, how about that? A smile!
          I'd say that calls for another
          drink!
          They laugh and raise another round.
          Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
          sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
          Frigga, bows her head.

                         SIF
          My Queen. I am so sorry for your
          loss.
          Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

                         FRIGGA
          Thank you, Sif.
          She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
          him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          How is he?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.

                         SIF
          He mourns for his brother. And he
          misses her. The mortal.
          Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
          Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.

                         FRIGGA
          He will need his friends now more
          than ever.

                         SIF
          I will always be at his side.
          Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.

          161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161

          Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
          walks up behind him.

                         ODIN
          You'll be a wise King.

                         THOR
          There will never be a wiser king
          than you. Or a better father.

                         (THEN)
          I have much to learn. I know that
          now. But some day, perhaps, I will
          make you proud.

                         ODIN
          You've already made me proud.
          Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

          162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162

          Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
          energy, drifting off into space.
          Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
          Thor stares out at the stellar void.

          Can you see her?
          Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         THOR
          How is she?

          163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163

          Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
          ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
          away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
          inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
          that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
          facility, abuzz with activity.
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
          the-art equipment.
          Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
          SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
          windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
          roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
          hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
          before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES" logo.
          From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.

                         DARCY
          Here you go.

                         JANE
          Thanks.
          Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

                         DARCY
          He would have come back if he
          could.

                         JANE
          I know. But if he can't get here
          on his own...
          Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D
          HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
          bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
          YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

           way back.

              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

              A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is
              JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as
              we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group
              of VILLAGERS.

              O
               N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs

          1
              to her side. She's mad. Her son cries.

                        You monsters!
              UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding
              AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we
              hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-
              - COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks
              up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.

                                  PANTERA
                        We appreciate the generous donation
                        for the continued protection of
                        your village.
              ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's
              precious crops.
              WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe
              distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately
              LUNGES at Pantera, just as-
              -SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed
              at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans
              forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck.

                                  PANTERA
                        After all, the jungle can be a very
                        dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
              They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING.

              The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits
              in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the
              food. The Jungle looms ominous around them.

              H
               IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling
              high above... as if from someone's POV.
              ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road
              ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.

                                  PANTERA
                        Idiota! Watch where you're going!

                        Well, what are you waiting for?!

                        REMOVE IT!

          CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
          and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.
           EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus
          bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!

                               CORTEZ (O.S.)
                    ...yirk!
          ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.

                              DRIVER SOLIDER
                        (softly, nervous)
                    D-d-dios mio.
          ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

                              PANTERA
                    What?! WHAT IS IT?!
          OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as
          the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY
          SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.
          Before he can react...
          - YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on
          the ground HARD.

                                URLY SOLDIER

                    OOF!
          Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...
          the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
          ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the
          back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and
          readies his machine gun.

                              PANTERA

              OS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches,
              kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and
              Driver look to the ground.
              ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        I'm sorry, senor.
              Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the
              jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg.

                                  PANTERA

                        COWARD!! GET BACK HERE!!
              Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look.
              Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE.

                                  PANTERA

                        SHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO

                        YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
              ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying
              to find him. Tense. Suddenly-
              -a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him!
               n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end
              of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving
              way too fast for the camera to keep up.
              Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off
              into the dense Jungle!
              ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.

              An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
              clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle.

                        Actually... it's "Turtle", pal.
              Pantera swings around. Eyes wide.
               N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and
              strong. Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a
              shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted
              smiling teeth.
              The poncho falls to the ground.

              the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA
              SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner.

                        Let's see if a ghost can die, then.

              The Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly -
              - the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The
              villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the
              jungle and bounce-slows into the FG!
              Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the
              stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the
              rear view mirror.

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        It's a miracle!
              The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks
              back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye.
              ...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely
              silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them
              WINKS as the boy smiles.

              Leo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them
              carefully on the ground. He KNEELS, head bowed, eyes closed.

              A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
              It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
              - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
              tearing off into the distance.

                                  NYPD #1 (O.S.)

                        FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
              Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
              OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
              hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
              doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
               ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

                                  MUGGER
                        Heh, heh... suckers.
              ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
              a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
              aiming directly for Mugger!

                                   MUGGER
                        Whaaa!!!
              The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
              all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
              and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
              the collar in mid-stride!

                                  MUGGER
                        You crazy?! Put me down, man!
              But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
              stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
              every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!

                                  MUGGER

                        OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
              Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver

               EXT. DEAD END ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed. Mugger
               SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
               like he's a human bowling ball.
               ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a
               ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley.
               And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
               The Driver gets off the bike. Silence. Backlit by headlight.
               He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose. Mugger starts
               to really freak out. Driver picks him up by the collar and
               SLAMS him to the back WOODEN FENCE WALL.

                                   MUGGER
                         P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
               Driver just cocks his head. Mugger can see his own terrified
               reflection his Driver's black visor. Driver reaches behind
               his back and pulls out a COMBAT KNIFE! He reels back and...

                         Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!

               W
                HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET,
               PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the
               purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley.
                fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of
               the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls
               the knife at the Driver!
               THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
                N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver
               slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver
               moves toward him... and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side.
               ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and
               throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to
               be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps.
               MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
               flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.

               Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off
               his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-

               - RAPHAEL, THE RED-MASKED NINJA TURTLE!
               He reaches back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks
               at it, shaking his head and grinning. He sheathes it.

                                    R

                                    APHAEL
                         Heh, heh. Nice try, chump.
               QUICK SHOTS - Ignites and revs engine. Straps helmet back on.
               Headlight comes to life. Lets the clutch out.
               VROOOOM! - CAM STARTS TIGHT ON bike as Raphael tears away.

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Dude... I'm scared!

                                                                 CUT TO:
               CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF TURTLE EYES... MICHAELANGELO'S! They're
               wide with FEAR. Nervously darting around, unable to keep up
               with the surrounding danger.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Dude! They're all around me! What
                         do I do? WHAT DO I DO?!
               Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in
               over a RADIO. Calming.

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         Just relax, Mikey. Remember your
                         training. You'll be fine.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

               INT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

               The cam pulls out of a LARGE MASCOT HEAD - looks like a big
               goofy Turtle head with googly eyes and dumb smile. WIDER we
               see a fake ZIPPER spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron. In his
               hands, he holds two nerf-styled NUNCHUCKS.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (from inside mascot head)
                         Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!
               Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run
               in SCREAMING and start beating on Mikey... a little too hard.

                                   SCREAMING KIDS
                         Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey!
                         Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!

                         HEY! NOT BELOW THE-OOOFF!! OW!!
               End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on
               the floor doubled over from the "playing". A beat, then-
               -one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey.

                                   LITTLE GIRL

               EXT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - SUNSET/LATER

               Beautiful downtown autumnal street. Parked in front, we see
               the "COWABUNGA CARL" PARTY VAN loudly decorated in kid-
               friendly colors with an embarrassing and low-tech looking
               TURTLE HEAD ON TOP. PUSH IN on upstairs apartment window.

                         Thanks so much. You're worth every
                         penny. I have to tell all my
                         friends about you. You'll love

               Mascot Mikey is standing at the door, holding a fistful of
               cash, still in full costume.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         I can only hope they're as lovely
                         as the rugrats you got here.
               ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a
               toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then-
               throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids
               quickly smile to cover.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (through gritted teeth)
                         Such... angels.
               Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack
               of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV.

                                   SOCCER MOM

                         BYE!!!!!!
               ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand
               reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes.

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Heheh... score.

               Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake
               zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head.
               His trademark orange bandana spills out.
               He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat
               until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance.
               Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car
               whizzes by.
               WIDER - the van takes off down the street.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER

               CLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic
               light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS
               Left. Reacts.
               OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
               behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a
               ventriloquist to "hide" his identity. Don follows on a small
               surveillance cam under the rearview mirror.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yes... sir.

                         That's a good boy.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         All's I'm saying Donnie is that no
                         one would notice if YOU did one of
                         these gigs every now and again.

                                    DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         But you add such... panache to the
                         character.
               Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He
               rubs his sore neck.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Well, if panache is French for
                         "punching bag", I'd have to agree
                         with ya.

               A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's,
               monitors and TV tubes. Cables run everywhere. In front of
               them is DONATELLO - our resident tech-head turtle.

               ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked
               out - at the fully animated Mikey head.

                         Aw nuts.
               Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
               frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
               waves back.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         Traffic's clear eastbound for two
                         blocks. Then hook up with route J.
               BACK WITH MIKEY - He's still waving with a frozen smile.

               Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and
               antics at the Man! Before the man can react, Mikey TEARS OUT
               and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street.
               ...as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering

               The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate
               closes behind it, obscuring it from view.

               slowly slides shut.

               The dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the

               But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's
               skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He
               jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles
               with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence.
               Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he
               arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a
               BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to...

               Mikey lands in the "foyer" of sorts. Atop entrance stairs. He
               kicks the double doors open.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Honeeeeey! I'm hooome!
               As Mikey slides down the banister, the cam dollies around

               I
               behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to fresh eyes.
                t has a wonderful lived-in feel - they're not squatters...
               they've made this their HOME. Furniture is jury-rigged and
               the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of
               atmosphere. If we looked behind the surface detail, we'd see
               a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair.
               Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the
               wad of money from the party.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Moneymoneymoneymoney.
               As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don
               stops as Mikey holds out his hand. Don's busted - he peels
               off a few bills and hands Mikey his share.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Domo arigato, dude.
               Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a
               remote as a BIG SCREEN lights up in front of him. Suddenly-

                                   SPLINTER (O.S.)

                         MICHAELANGELO!
               Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps to obedience.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yes, sensei.
               ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of
               the TMNT. He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has
               the same sparkle in his eye. He approaches Mikey. Silent.

                                   SPLINTER
                             (a beat)
                         Well?

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                             (thinks, then realizes)
                         Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
               Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece
               of BIRTHDAY CAKE. Splinter lights up.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Ahh! Butter creme frosting!
               Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Master. No cake. You remember your
                         last cholesterol tests.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But I-
                             (changes attitude)
                         -Donatello! I am your Master!

                                   DONATELLO
                         Nice try, sensei. But you can still
                         be my Master... with low
                         cholesterol.
               Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away,
               Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes
               Splinter a smaller wrapped piece.

                                   SPLINTER
                         He-heh. You have done well, my son.
               Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with
               dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses
               it with the rest.                                  C

               The street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along
               the edge of the building, reaching a row of GARGOYLES.
                AN ALONG GARGOYLES - Still. Concrete. Creepy. Just as we
               pass the fourth, we barely notice it's WHITE EYES OPENING.
               QUICK SNAP BACK TO GARGOYLE - Only now it's gone. Something

               Large freighters. Lots of activity. PUSH IN on a steamer as a
               crane lowers a LARGE VERTICAL CRATE to the dock - it THUMPS
               down hard.

               CAM LOWERS - as APRIL O'NEIL leaps down into frame. Dressed
               in jungle expedition gear with her head wrapped in a bandana.
               She takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate.
               ON BOX - Labelled "O'Neil Cargo". Something ominous about the
               crate. PUSH IN on it as April steps in front. Admires it with
               pride. Turns, takes out a cell phone, and hits speed dial.
               ON PHONE DISPLAY - "Calling HOME". It rings.

               A spacious NYC loft - tons of bookcases work as room
               dividers. Piled with artifacts, unopened crates of all sizes,
               boxes of maps, and a general organized mess. A hockey game
               BLARES from a TV set.
               CAM PANS ACROSS ROOM - The telephone continues to ring just
               as we reach the KITCHEN - with piles of dirty dishes and fast
               food. And then a path of strewn clothes that gets messier and
               messier until we reach -
               - CASEY JONES, snoring on a sofa. He finally wakes up,
               clamors for the phone, tripping over mess in the process.

                         Hey. It's me. I'm back.
               Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch.

                                   CASEY
                         Was that today, babe?
               April's disappointed. Same old Casey.

                         to you after being in a deadly
                         jungle for almost a month.

                         Forget it. I'll take a cab.
               A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted.

                                   CASEY
                         I missed you?
               April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in
               his chair, shaking his head.

                                   CASEY
                         Good goin', Case.
               Back at the dock, April is back to business.

                                   APRIL
                         Howie! Get this on the truck for
                         delivery! Let's go!
               P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd
               swear we almost hear... LOW GROWLING.

               Mikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on
               TV - bored. He puts down the controller and yells to the
               ceiling.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         I'M! BORED!!!!!
               He stands up and walks to DON'S ROOM. He opens it. It takes
               only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of
               TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open.
                N DON - He's hunched over a work table, back to Mikey.
               Tinkering as always. Wild inventions line the walls, some
               finished, some not. Some pay tribute to past TMNT adventures.

                    like we never really left that
                    glass turtle bowl when we were
                    little dudes.
          REVERSE ANGLE - Don lifts his head up, eyes MAGNIFIED in some
          bizarre head contraption. He flips up side panels,
          ELECTRONICA MUSIC blares out.

                               ONATELLO

          A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING
          ROOM SOFA. He and the camera think he's alone, but before he
          knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,
          still, and sipping tea.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    WAH!!

                              SPLINTER
                    Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an
                    indicator of your surroundings. It
                    is a reflection of your inner
                    heart. Fill yourself with
                    excitement on the inside... and
                    you'll live the most rewarding life
                    of all.
          Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to
          flipping channels. He stops on a NEWS program - "NYC DIRT".

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
                    And so yet again, police officials
                    are baffled at a crime of
                    retribution that can only be
                    attributed to the mysterious figure
          M         known as "The Nightwatcher".
           ikey lights up. On TV is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing

                    Although the victims have been
                    criminals themselves, the
                    Nightwatcher's actions have been
                    identified as destructive and
                    overly-violent... verging on the
                    edge of lethal.
          ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,
          returns with a POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a picture of the TV.
          He pulls it out, placing it in his NIGHTWATCHER SCRAPBOOK,
          overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the
          vigilante.

                    know.
          ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where
          in sight.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Whatta we talkin' about, boys?
                    Soundin' a little too egghead fer
                    my tastes.

                               PLINTER
                    Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I
                    were just discussing the vigilante
                    Nightwatcher once again.
                        (beat - concerned)
                    Where have you been? You've been
                    spending so much time away from
                    home lately...
          Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.
          His attention doesn't break from Donatello.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I joined a book a' the month club.

                    So just what's your beef with
                    puttin' dirtbags behind bars,
                    Donnie? Go ahead... enlighten me.

          Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.

                              DONATELLO
                    I have no problem with the
                    incarceration of those who deserve
                    it, but if someone like
                    Nightwatcher has ultimate power...
                    then who makes sure he doesn't
                    cross the line?
          Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around
          aggressively in mock battle.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I think he's COOL.

                              DONATELLO
                    Of course you would.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Sometimes there are lines that even
                    the police can't cross. Someone has
                    to be willing to do what needs to
                    be done. And to do that, fear
                    becomes a weapon.

                              DONATELLO
                    You are such a Neanderthal.
          Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick
          and startled, eyes wide.

                                APHAEL
                    I rest my case.

                        (SCOLDING)
                    Raphael! If bullying is the only
                    way to argue your point, then
                    perhaps you do not have much of a
                    point to begin with.

                               APHAEL
                        (gritted teeth)
                    Yes, sensei.
                        (to Mikey)
                    And quit touchin' my stuff.
          Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms
          out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the
          second floor.

          

                                                                          20.

                         That was just a startle response
                         and isn't really an indication of
                         fear!
               Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his
               room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC...
               ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song.

                                   RAPHAEL (O.S.)

               Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A
               silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room.
               Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two.

               A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels
               fold out under the carriages.
               CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the
               city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG-
               GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to
               the water and RELEASES!

               Disgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat...
               inhales, then SMILES WIDE.

                                   LEONARDO

               All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only
               light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered
               in junk food wrappers. Donnie sleeps with an "TECH HEAD"
               magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap.
               ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor.
               The place feels different... but still feels like home.

               the potential noise-making mess below him. He sneaks to-

               Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting
               him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Enter.
               Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I have completed my training,
                         master. I am prepared for the next
                         stage.

                                   SPLINTER
                         That you are, my son. You must now
                         apply all that you have learned on
                         your lengthy journey to your
                         everyday life. THAT will be the
                         most challenging training of all...
                plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION.
               Leo is touched.
               CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES,
               watching the entire scene... jealous.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I've missed you, Leonardo.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I've missed you too, father.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I'm afraid much has changed in your
                         brothers' spirits since you have
                         left. But now that you are home,
                         they will finally have the ethical
                         and warrior leadership they have
                         been lacking. The family needs you.
               ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.

          ON OUTSIDE OF ROOM - Raphael walks out of the shadows. He's
          good... but not too good for Splinter. Splinter and Leo break
          and face the doorway. An awkward silence.

                                  LEONARDO
                       Hey.

                       Well, I'm goin' to bed.
          He leaves.
          TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back
          of the head, and keeps on walking.

                       Leo!!

               Famous NYC entrepreneur.
                inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every

               decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal. This guy is

               others), floor routines and bag work. He takes it all very
               seriously.
               Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung
               training block with his bare fist. He walks out of the room,
               grabbing a towel from a blonde assistant.

               Winters walks in his crisp suit. His office is large and
               austere. Two levels of history in books, artifacts, warrior
               themed curios and power.

               He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING -
                 Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up
               and down the front of the building, allowing him access to
               any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk.
               WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of
               Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish
               gated entry. A true work of modern architecture.

               We see the wonder of everything Winters - mixing of old

               follow them as they walk down to the TV area.

                         Say, what's up with April and
                         Casey? I expected them to drop by
                         after I got back.

                         We don't see much of `em anymore.
                         April seems to be working a lot -
                         eww - and Casey seems to be, I
                         dunno, "different" lately. Maybe he
                         doesn't like having to put the
                         toilet seat down now that they've
                         moved in together.

                         They're living together now?
               They get to the living room area. Mikey walks to the edge of
               a jury-rigged HALF-PIPE he built in an old water slough.

               He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her. Casey's eyes
               widen - is THIS what his girlfriend does?

                                    APRIL
                         Hello Max.

                             (BEAT)
                         This is my... friend, Casey Jones.

          Winters nearly crushes Casey's hand in his grip.

                              CASEY
                    Actually, It's Ca-

                              WINTERS
                        (ignoring, back to April)
                    So how was your trip?

                              APRIL
                    You know, the typical - corrupt
                    government officials, double
                    crossed by a jungle guide, all
                    ending in a heart-pounding chase.
          Winters and April chuckle. Cam adjusts to show Casey between
          them in the bg, looking uncomfortable and out of place.

                              APRIL

                    I found it. The fourth General.
          Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her
          hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly
          HIGH FIVES her.

                              CASEY
                    Yeah-ha! The fourth General.

                              APRIL
                        (hushed gritted teeth)
                    The crow-bar.

                              CASEY
                    Oh.
          He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks
          open the front panel.
          INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK
          - the front panel falls to the floor.
          CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He
          walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back.

                    ...the gods be praised.
          ON BOX - We finally see the statue - GENERAL AGUILA - a seven-
          foot towering wall of granite and obsidian. Eagle warrior
          armor reflecting a South American design... though not from a
          specific time period. Winters rubs his hand over the stone.

                                    APRIL
                         I've been so grateful for the
                         opportunities you've given me
                         lately. I'd probably be still
                         selling antique curios if you
                         hadn't visited my shop that day.
                              (off of box)
                         But I have to ask... why the
                         fascination with these particular
                         works of art? I'd never even heard
                         of the Legend of Yaotl until we
                         met.

               EXT. FLASHBACK BATTLEFIELD - 3000 YEARS AGO

               -the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies
               around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing
               figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits.
               Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed.
               Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         It was a time long before the
                         Mayans, April. Long before the
                         Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was
                         a time of legends. A time of
                         greatness. The true mother culture
                         of Central America.
               Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc.

                                    INTERS (V.O.)
                         There was a man named Yaotl. More a
                         force of nature than man. And
                         together with his Four Warrior-
                         Priest Generals, they pillaged
                         every culture in their path.
               QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
               Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their
               distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         And for every culture they
                         destroyed, they drank in all the
                         magic and knowledge known to them.

                              WINTERS(cont'd)
                    They became a warring hurricane,
                    gathering more power and knowledge
                    with each conquest.
          GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally
          stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons
          are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS.

                                WINTERS (V.O.)
                    Then they came across a culture
                    rich with science, magic and their
                    own technology. A South American
                    version of "Atlantis".

                        (

                          BEAT)
                    It was like blood in the water for
                    a predator like Yaotl.
          CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM
          DOLLIES AROUND HIS HEAD REVEALING their opposing forces. An
          army of THOUSANDS. Waving their weapons in the air.
          The opposing army CHARGES. Yaotl's men pull out   a large
          ORNAMENTAL STAND - a "stargate" of sorts. Yaotl   and his men
          are unmoving... as they begin a ceremony. Yaotl   looks to the
          heavens above - as we see a CLUSTER OF SPECIFIC   STARS move
          into place.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    As the army approached, Yaotl used
                    the knowledge they'd gained in
                    black magic and sorcery. Timing
                    their attack with the alignment of
                    the Stars of Kikin, they opened a
                    portal to another world.
          ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit
          by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect -
          ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another
          dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT!
          Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    They unleashed an army of monsters.
           N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered (in a nice PG sort
          of way). Quick shots. Intense.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    The monsters knew no side   - they
                    destroyed the enemy... as   well as
                    Yaotl's own army. Men who   swore to
                    spill their blood for his   cause.
                    Yaotl had to do something   to stop
                    more from coming through.

                         In the end, there were no victors.
                         And they were responsible for the
                         eradication of the greatest culture
                         that will never be known. The
                         knowledge that was lost would never
                         be found again...

               Casey has fallen asleep, sitting to the side, head in his
               hand. A line of DROOL hangs from his mouth. April is

               statue. A beat. He turns his head to the side.

                                   WINTERS
                         You can come out now.
                 IDER - As we see FOUR FIGURES appear out of the smallest and
               darkest of shadows! The LEADER slinks forward - clearly a

               S
               woman - dressed in cloak and Japanese Noh mask over her face.
                he takes it off, revealing KARAI - the beautiful leader of
               the Japanese Foot Clan, flanked by three, FOOT NINJAS.

                                   WINTERS
                         Your talents are commendable.

                                   KARAI
                         As are yours. Most don't notice us
                         until we decide they will.

          

                                                                          34.

                         way.
               Winters walks over to his desk. The Statue looms behind them.

                                   WINTERS
                         So down to business - aside from
                         the other reasons for your visit to
                         America, are you interested in my
                         offer we discussed?

                         I must confess... I still don't
                         know exactly what we are to do for
                         you.

                                   WINTERS
                         I need the finely-tuned eyes and
                         stealth of your Foot Ninja to...
                         monitor the city for me over the
                         next few days.
               Winters walks to his window. It's night. Overlooks the city.

                                   WINTERS
                         Just keep your eyes peeled for
                         anything... strange.

                                   KARAI
                             (long beat)
                         What kind of strange things?
               The question hangs as we PUSH IN ON Statue's face... his
               eerie eyes. We think his eye GLOWS, only we-

               The glowing eye is really a STAR. The same line pattern we
               saw at movie's open. The stars ADJUST... lining up in a more
               straight-lined manner.

               A MAN walks down the sidewalk. As he passes a DARKENED
               ALLEYWAY, he hears a low GROWL come from it. He stops.
               ALLEY POV - As the man looks in. Can't see a thing. Hand-held
               cam. He moves to leave... and the growl comes again.
               STREET - Man stares in. No one on the street. Looks closer...
               closer... grows more tense as...

               Man half to death.

                             (calms down)
                         Gave me a scare kitty.
               He pets the kitty a bit, then walks off. CAM LOWERS behind
               cat, as Man walks off into the distance. Until...
               ...WHAM! A large burly CLAWED ARM slams out of the shadows
               onto the cat, yanking it back into the alley! Quick
               caterwaul. Silence. And then we hear a BURP.

               Leo feverishly works out. He stops, looking up, panting.

                         Does ANYBODY train anymore?!

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)

                         in the middle of-

                         Um... make that another hour.
               Leo sighs. Splinter walks by, not stopping.

                                   SPLINTER
                         A true leader knows how to motivate
                         his troops regardless of their own
                         motivations.
               Splinter walks past a large FUSE BOX. Leo thinks a beat. Then
               smiles.

               INT. DARK CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Another place that isn't the TMNT lair. Dark and mysterious.
               Don't know where we are. Feels ceremonial. We see close up
               detail of statue GRANITE.
               A DEEP VOICE chants OS in a South American tongue as HIGH-
               TECH GEAR is placed on the rock. It becomes powered,
               triggering a reaction in the stone itself.
               Music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks
               GLOWING RED. Camera travels with the rising glow.
               End on a pair of DEAD EYES - suddenly come to life. Red glow.

               The boys stand high atop the city below. Readying to run a

               Leo and Raph glare at each other.

                         Deal.

                         Donnie, but you ain't exactly the

          Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension.

                    Just trust me on this one.
          Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on
          buildings. The course requires them to work as a TEAM,
          throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle
          to obstacle.
          Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick
          wall. Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next
          opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a
          billboard. The situation escalates at each juncture.

                              LEONARDO
                    Have you been avoiding me? Barely
                    seen you since I got home.

                    upset at me or anything, right?

                              RAPHAEL
                    Why'd you think that?

                              LEONARDO
                    I don't know... your brother gets
                    to go on a world-wide training
                    mission and you have to stay home.
                    Might upset me too.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Are you trying to make me mad?

                              LEONARDO
                    I'm just saying, I'd understand if
                    you were upset.
          Their intensity ESCALATES.

                    You wouldn't understand the first
                    thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!.
           hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop
          rolling, continue fighting.

                    Is that what this is about? You
                    think Splinter likes me best?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You'd love that, wouldn't you?

                ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They
               stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge... only Leo
               doesn't twitch. Suddenly-

                         We need to come up with a plan.

                         Later!
               Raph RUNS OFF toward the action.

               But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then-

               The boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale
               up the few more stories to the top. They stand on a scaffold
               underneath the floor of the activity.

               like by April and Casey's loft. Don notices.

                    Ahh, let's take a tiny peek.
          They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Well, there's a good/bad news
                    scenario for ya.
          CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Good news is that there are a
                    buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot
                    kicked out of `em.
          CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI
          squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses
          them around like stuffed animals.

                               ICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                    Bad news is WHAT's kickin' the snot
                    out of `em...
          ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner
          of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past
          them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below)

                               D

                               ONATELLO
                    An interesting conundrum. Do we
                    hold dear the value of life and
                    help the Foot regardless of our
                    tumultuous past?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I vote for sitting back and
                    enjoying the show.
                        (to Leo)
                    Whaddaya say, leader boy?
          ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nah. We kick butt.
          Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles
          jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the
          Bigfoot Monster is confused as well.
          ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.

                               EONARDO
                    Who are YOU?!
          ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana
          attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this
          opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks
          back at the Turtles...

          

          R

          

          

          

          

                                                                     40.

          

          

          
          The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the
          structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it,
          not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below!
           aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The
          boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper
          trouble.
          The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact.
          The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many
          flights of floors.
          Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the
          building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom
          floor to await the others.
          SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nice of ya's ta join me.
          But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the
          Creature closes in-

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!!
          The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    What? I saw it on a nature show
                    once.
          The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out.

                              TURTLES

                    AAAAAAGGHHHHH!!!!!

          A
           NGLE ABOVE TURTLES - As a large teetering pallet filled with
          dried cement and blocks to come CRASHING DOWN ON THEM! The
          Turtles are buried under the rubble.
          RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a
          blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We hear heavy
          footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form
          until we see...
          ...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH
          TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings.
          Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through
          their stone cracks and piercing eyes.
          The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape-
          themed costume ("MONO"), Eagle Leader ("AGUILA"), agile
          Jaguar ("GATO") and the deadly snake-like female
          ("SERPIENTE"). Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass.
          The Creature ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail...

          

                                                                         41.

          

          

          
               BURIED POV - Silent. The Turtles start to GROAN, regaining
               consciousness. Moonlight shoots in as they move the rock and
               stand up, groggy.
               ON MOUTH OF ALLEY - Through the smoke we can see silhouettes -
               a large hairy shape, along with FOUR VERY LARGE SHAPES. The
               sounds of freighter doors CLOSING, engines revving and then a
               caravan of sorts pulling away.
               WHOOOOOP! - A POLICE SIREN chirps. Approaching the now-
               destroyed site.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Better hit the tunnels, guys.
               Donnie uses a small prod to prop open a MANHOLE COVER. Don,
               Mike and Leo jump in. Leo looks back, Raph is still stewing.

                                    LEONARDO
                         Raph. Save it for another day.

                             (BEAT)

                         RAPH!
               Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he enters the sewer. The
               lid closes as the alley is illuminated by POLICE CHERRIES.

               A
                 beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek.

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Y'know, it's not that bad, dudes.
               ON BUILDING - Actually, the place is destroyed. Dented, torn
               and looking like a post-night raid in WWII.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               UP ANGLE on the Tower. Dead of night. No one around.

          

          

               INT. WINTERS TOWER SECRET CELL BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS


          50                                                               50
               A cavernous structure. Dimly lit. High ceiling. A few odd
               silhouettes here and there.
               We hear the clicking of Winters' shoes echo as he enters.

                                   WINTERS
                         What seems to be the problem?
               Karai and six Ninja are already there.

                                   KARAI
                         The "problem" is that we were hired
                         to merely patrol the city and
                         report anything "strange" to you.

                                   (MORE)

                                                                    42.
                              KARAI(cont'd)
                        (grabs sword hilt)
                    You never said anything about

                    MONSTERS.
          Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take
          the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The Foot
          TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a

          MONEY BRICK.

                               INTERS
                        (tosses money brick)
                    So, your job duties were just
                    redefined. Congratulations on your
                    promotion.
          SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-
          air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.

                              KARAI
                    We may be hired help to you, but
                    you should never forget... we are
                    the Foot Clan.
          ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.

                              WINTERS
                    Oooooooh...
          It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving
          toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at
          Winters throat!
          ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.
          Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
          shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.
          They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of
          it all.
          The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
          unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.

                               WINTERS
                    I believe we made a deal, Karai. I
                    expect you to honor it.
                         (beat, stares her down)
                    You do understand "honor", don't
                    you?
          Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.

                              WINTERS
                    So I don't care what part of
                    "muscle for hire" you don't
                    understand. I hired your muscle.
                    Now exercise the ones attached to
                    your feet and...
                        (closer - terse)
                    ...get back to work.

          

                                                                    43.

          

          

          
          Karai slowly steps back. Winters smiles wide, reaches into
          the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to

                               W
          a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.

                               INTERS
                    So I will double... no, no...
                    TRIPLE your pay for your troubles.
                        (stare down)
                    Are we cool?
          ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
          seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.

                              WINTERS
                    Are we... cool?
          The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.

                              WINTERS
                    Ninjas. No sense of humor.
                        (to Generals)
                    So how did we fare?
          CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
          wheeled into the light.
          Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
          pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the
          HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.

                              WINTERS
                        (close, quiet)
                    So it begins...
          It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
          Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.
          Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He
          merely grins at the creature.

                              WINTERS
                        (to General Aguila)
                    Were there any problems?
          AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
          Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                    None, my lord.

                              WINTERS
                        (to Karai)
                    You see, now THAT'S a good soldier.
                    You two should compare notes.
          Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not
          used to being handled like this.

          

                              K

          

          

          

          

                                                                  44.

          

          

          

                              KARAI
                    Just what is this all about?

                              WINTERS
                    Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt.
                        (re: Generals)
                    I now have the power and know-how,
                    but I need the speed and stealth of
                    an organization such as your own.
                    Not to mention an organization that
                    values discretion.

                              KARAI
                    But of course.

                              WINTERS
                    You see, I have nine more beasts
                    like this that should be coming to
                    town very soon. Thirteen in all, to
                    be exact.
          The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
          floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see
          the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.

                               ARAI
                    But... why? Why here? Why now?

                               WINTERS
                    Instinct, mostly. They're animals
                    at their core.
                        (looks off, distant)
                    And they recognize something

          The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some

               Three brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung
               over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking
               the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table.

                         Was it just me, or did that
                         creature look familiar?

                         strange to see the Foot too. And
                         who was that woman?

          Splinter makes himself a TEA. Room is SILENT.
          ON TURTLES - Raph and Leo GLARE at one another while they
          eat. Don is pouring over a THICK BOOK while Mikey sits with
          his forehead on the table.

                    And in the latest of a string of
                    strange criminal activity, a
                    construction site was nearly
                    destroyed last night. Authorities
                    believe a violent battle had taken
                    place earlier that evening.
          The boys react and rush into the MAIN LIVING AREA.
          ON TV - a well-coifed News Reporter stands outside of the I-
          BEAM TOWER. In the daylight, we can see the building is
          twisted and dented from the night's fighting.
          The boys immediately JUMP FORWARD. Mikey grabs the remote and
          ups the volume.

                    My sons, what-
          Splinter's eyes go wide. He looks at his boys listening to
          the TV intently. Mikey nurses his sore head.

                              SPLINTER

                         Leonardo, I am most disappointed in
                         you. You are the leader of your
                         brothers. I was counting on you to
                         bring order to the chaos of this
                         family.

                         But Master Splinter, how can I be
                         expected to do so when Ra-

               ON LEO - Biting his tongue. Hard.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But the involvement of the Foot and
                         their mysterious leader worries me.

                         of New York. But hey, that's just
                         me.

                         Are you happy? I mean, with your
                         life. With me.
               Casey pauses a beat. Tries to be upbeat.

                                    CASEY
                         Yeah. Sure.
                              (beat - serious)
                         You?
               April thinks just as much.

                                   APRIL
                         Yeah.
               They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss.
               April doesn't notice. Awkward. Casey changes his mind.

                                   CASEY
                             (walks to the window)

               Casey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better.

                                   APRIL
                             (to herself)

               Casey climbs up from the fire escape. Checks to make sure
               he's alone. He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out -
               A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK!
               He slips it on. Does a few warm up swings. Cricks his neck.

               EXT. NYC ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

               All is still, until the panicked face of a BURGLAR enters
               frame. Being held by his collar.

                                   BURGLAR

                         I'M SORRY MAN! I-I-I WON'T EVER DO

                         IT AGAIN! I'M SORR-OOOF!
               BAM! - the leather fist of Nightwatcher slams Burglar back,
               tripping over an A/C duct. He tries to shield himself-
               REVERSE ANGLE - BOOM! - Nightwatcher lands in the FG.

                         someone else does it... all over
                         yer HEAD!
               Night hurls him back into a roof access door, denting it.
               Raph's loving this. Walks to the Burglar and picks him up.

                                   BURGLAR
                             (almost in tears)

                         I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!!!

                         night to be a criminal...
               Night cocks his fist just as-

          It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by
          Night's CHAIN, and pulled down. Raph's visor flips up.

                         for some disaster to cross our
                         paths. Of us battling Utroms and

                         creature... when there was still
                         some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet
                         above the lair. Just didn't seem
                         right. `Specially if we had the

                    What about the walking statues?
                    Were you going to mention THOSE?!

          One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER
          and wallops the Creature with one blow.

                              CASEY
                    On second thought...
          The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a
          TRANSPORTER VEHICLE as it drives away. They're just about to
          leave when-

          S
           HINK! - Casey accidentally knocks a tiny piece of rock from
          the ledge. It falls down - CLANG! - on a garbage can lid.

               Raph takes out NINJA SMOKE PELLETS and throws them on the
               roof - FWOOM! When the smoke clears, Casey is standing there
               alone! Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off
               too.

               They can't lose him, even when they drop to street level.

               Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying
               to escape the thing that's close on their tail.

                         WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS, RAPH?!
               Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign. Then he sees it -
               56th Street.

                                      RAPHAEL
                         Bingo.
               Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC!
               DOWN ALLEY BEHIND THEM - BOOM BOOM BOOM - We see Gato
               bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run,
               occasionally jumping off walls at incredible speeds! A true
               jaguar. It leaps through the traffic as well.

          UNDER A BRIDGE - Raph points up and - CHOOP! - hits a remote
          that lowers his MOTORCYCLE.

                    What are we gonna do, Raph? WHAT

                    ARE WE GONNA-

                    -hey, cool ride.

                                RAPHAEL
                    Hop on.
          Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato
          clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the
          fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato.
          It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey
          swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.
          Suddenly - THUNK!
          A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks
          at it.

                                CASEY
                    Um, Raph?
          Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid-
          ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks
          and punches at their pursuer when he closes in.
          The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle
          upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails!
          ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside
          from jumping the bike to the next roof!

          He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks
          and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look
          back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.

                              CASEY

          ...and then -thumpthumpthump- Gato JUMPS DOWN TOWARD THEM!

                                CASEY
                    Oh crap.
          Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato
          is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and
          drags him off.

               Gato lands and patrols the roof... almost SNIFFING them out.
               Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack.
               Suddenly - BOOM! - Gato finds them. He tries to smash through
               the steel door with his bare hands!
               Raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort.
               He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam
               by Gato. Casey tries to help as well.
               Gato comes close to breaking in. Very tense. Then-
               -the LIGHT on his exo-suit begins to STROBE. A signal. A
               signal to return home. He surveys quickly... then runs off.
               Casey and Raph fall out. Both shell-shocked.

                    And I suppose that bringing up the
                    thirty-foot flying monster would
                    probably just push this over the
                    edge, huh?
          ON APRIL - She slowly turns to Casey. Floored.

                              LEONARDO
                    What are you talking about Casey?

                              CASEY
                    Just some story this Winters guy
                    told us. It all started down in
                    South America. Long before the
                    Ashmecks and the Macaroons.

          CAM PANS TO THE RIGHT - As it passes a FG element, the screen
          dips to black. We hear sounds of a violent BATTLE. Monsters
          shrieking. Blades clashing. April's retelling Winters' story.

                                                         DIP TO BLACK:
          Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in
          particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like before, has
          fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then-

                              APRIL
                    No one knows. The legend stops
                    there.

                    The micro-tech of this dart is
                    astounding. The molybdenum is of a
                    grade only found in a few select
                    markets... not to mention it's
                    current stock is going for a little
                    more than two-grand an ounce right

                    So what do we have? We have someone
                    with a lot of money.

                               ONATELLO
                    Access to technology... and the
                    means to produce it to exact specs.

                              RAPHAEL

                    interest in these monsters... and

                              DONATELLO
                    If you ask me, it all somehow
                    points to Winters Corp.

                              LEONARDO
                    How do you figure that, Donnie?
          Donatello looks up with MAGNIFYING GOGGLES on. Sarcastic.

                              DONATELLO
                    Hello? "Genius"?
                        (a beat)
                    Well, that, and the fact that this

                    on it.

                               EONARDO
                    Do you think he's trying to
                    recreate the events from back then?

                              RAPHAEL
                    Well, what would you do with an
                    army of monsters?

                    freakin' hairball that attacked us?

                               APHAEL

                    and flying creature that attacked
                    me n' Casey?

                              APRIL
                    Okay. Fine. I'll help for now...
                    until we prove you're all insane.

                              LEONARDO
                    Or until we prove Winters is up to
                    something more than collecting art.

                              DONATELLO
                    I'll work with April and see if
                    these Stars of Kikin she told us
                    about can give us any clues.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I say we just storm the castle and
                    face this jerk in person!

                              LEONARDO
                    Raph, that would be the worst idea
                    yet. We hang back. Analyze.
                    Formulate a plan, THEN storm your
                    castle. Are we clear?
          Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway.
          Casey stops him. Quieter moment.

                    Raph. Don't do it, man.

                    I spent my whole life running out
                    of rooms ticked off at the world. I
                    wish I could take most of `em back.
                    Sometimes, just takin' a breather
                    is the best thing to do.
          ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is
          growing up. Raph knows he can't win.

               The clicking intensifies. He follows the signal for twenty
               feet. Drops to the ground and digs the sand...

               .
                ..and comes up with a old unopened CAN OF SARDINES.

               He turns to leave the beach.

                         Lousy metal detector. "Happy

                         keister.
               He HURLS the can of sardines over his shoulder. Only, instead
               of hearing a tiny SPLASH from it hitting the water... we hear
               a snarling CRUNCH and TINNY-CHEWING.
               The man stops in his tracks. He turns his head around.
               CLOSE ON - Man's face, eyes wide in shock. Cam pulls back,
               slowing just as the crown of a GNARLY SKULL crests the bottom
               of the screen.
               PTOOEY! - The tin "key" is spit back onto the sand. He bolts.

               It's dark. Barely lit in the hallways of the top private
               floors of Winters Tower.
               The camera travels the long and ornate hallways. Decorated in
               a different sense than the main building... in a sense of
               family, tradition and legacy.
                ictures spanning centuries in age. Some photos. Some
               portraits. Families. Loved ones.

               Cam continues until we find a high-backed chair parked in
               front of an oversized blazing FIREPLACE.
               ON CHAIR - Winters sits. Tired. Sullen. Sipping brandy. Looks
               above the fireplace and lifts his snifter in a toast.

                                    INTERS

               ABOVE FIREPLACE - is a suit of armor... THE suit of armor of
               none other than Yaotl the Conqueror. He looks at it with
               heavy thought. Then-

                                   WINTERS
                         What is it?
               Winters doesn't turn around. Stays in E-FG. Cam adjusts to
               show the shape of GENERAL AGUILA in the doorway.

                                   GENERAL AGUILA
                         Two creatures remain, my lord.
               A long beat. Winters closes his eyes.

                                    WINTERS
                         Well, by all means then. Let's
                         finish it.
               ON AGUILA - He squints. Deep in thought and not sharing.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Nightwatcher runs along the rooftops. He pauses. He lifts his
               visor to feel the night air on his face. He sees WINTERS
               TOWER in the distance... practically egging him on.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               A greasy DINER COOK finishes cleaning up the tables. He
               suddenly hears a noise in the back. Big CLANK.
               KITCHEN - He walks to the back. He hears the noise... now
               from inside the WALK-IN FREEZER. He slowly approaches it.
               ANOTHER NOISE. He moves to open
               INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens. The man's face
               peers in. His eyes go WIDE. He SCREAMS!!!

               Nightwatcher hears the scream. Runs to the source and looks
               down at Pete's Diner. Sees the commotion inside. Uses his
               bolo chain and a power cable to form a ZIP LINE down the
               street as-

          

                                                                       67.

               INT. PETE'S DINER - MOMENTS LATER

               -KERSMASH! He goes through the front window! He stands, cat-
               like. Ready for anything. The room is only lit by the neon
               signage behind the counter. Suddenly -
               Night creeps to the freezer. He can hear the CHEWING and the
               SNARLING behind the thick door. He takes out a spiked brass-
               knuckle. Ready. Places a hand on the door... and opens it.
               ON DOORWAY - The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen
               meat. Chewing with pieces flying everywhere. Disgusting. It
               turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking DEMON... but
               "cute" in a bizarre kinda way. Music builds as go-
               WIDER ON SIDE VIEW - Night stands there. The horrible demon
               creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too! Face off with
               Raph as we realize-
               -it's only THREE FEET TALL!

                                   NIGHTWATCHER
                         Hey there little fella. All that
                         commotion for just little ole y-
               The Demon SCREAMS! It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor
               behind a row of tables!

                                   NIGHTWATCHER (O.S.)

                         WAHH! OOOF! AAAGGH! OW!! WHOAAA!!!
               Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all
               over the diner as the Demon pummels him.
               CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming
               his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward,
               mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon
               jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN.

               T
                he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is
               ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped
               up on cocaine.
               A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night
               knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his
               pocket. And waits... until...
               ...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs
               bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside!
               WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its
               mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and
               eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner!

                    Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't
                    mess with the Nightwatcher!
          Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on
          the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds
          the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary.

                              DINER COOK
                    Pl-pl-please don't hurt me!

                    Please, sir. I have kids.
          Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor.
          He picks it up, puts it on the counter.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    There ya go, pal. Make sure this is

                        (points threatening)

                    I JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE!
          Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash
          register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window.
          CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to
          the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders
          of LEO.
           ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of
          Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register.
          CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The
          frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him.

          B
           ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying
          to figure out his next move.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    This night just keeps gettin'

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

               Night tears down the streets and through back alleys. Leo
               keeps up with him effortlessly, hurling an assortment of
               THROWING STARS his way.
               Night suddenly DASHES OUT into traffic! Jumping over passing
               cars from roof to roof!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Nice try, amateur.
               Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his
               secrecy. Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming
               bus, and flips back onto a cable.
                e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't
                         you?
               They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top.
               Leo wastes no time in catching up.

               The chase continues. Night giving it his all, and Leo keeping
               up pretty easily. He throws Leo a pretty strong curveball,
               and Leo barely recovers.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Okay, someone's been training
                         pretty hard.

               Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the
               buildings has a LARGE LETTERED SIGN facing away. Fills the
               rooftop with silhouettes. No choice but to turn around...
               ...as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I want you to know that I
                         appreciate your intentions. But you
                         can't change the world like this.
               INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear
               Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him.

                    chance to just walk away and stop
                    this vigilante nonsense.
          Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (to himself in helmet)
                    Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
          Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with
          expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each
          other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.
          They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it
          out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.
          There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.
          Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.

                              LEONARDO
                    What? How did you-
          ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.
          Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD.
          Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control,
          restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under
          Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.

                              LEONARDO
                    Goodnight, dark prince.
          Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face
          falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales.

                              LEONARDO
                    R-raph?

                        (THINKS)
                    What?
          But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat.

                              RAPHAEL

                    AAAAAAAAGHH!!
          He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock.
          They yell at each other through the pouring rain.

          

                                                                          71.

          

          

          

                                   RAPHAEL
                         You're so friggin' smug! You think
                         the world revolves around YOU,
                         dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY
                         survive without the mighty and
                         powerful Leonardo to guide us
                         through our problems, HUH?!

                             (PACES)
                         Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we
                         got along just fine without you.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I was training! Training to be a
                         better leader! For you! Why do you
                         hate me for that?!

                                   RAPHAEL
                         ...and whoever said I wanted to be
                         led? I shoulda gone on that
                         training!

                                   LEONARDO

                         Y
                          OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient
                         and hot-tempered! And more
                         importantly... I'm better than you.
               Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and
               pulls out his TWIN SAIS. He flips them to the front.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Well, big brother, I'd have to
                         disagree with you on that one.
               Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight.
               Brother vs. brother. Katana vs. Sai. Technique vs. Heart.

               In another part of the city, the Generals have caught the
               Demon from Pete's Diner. As they carry him to the caravan,
               their RADIO COMM goes off.

               Camera RISES UP until we reach the rooftop where Leo and Raph
               continue to duke it out in the rain.
               They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball
               of anger, unleashing everything on Leo.

               It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai

               MILLIMETERS FROM HIS EYEBALL!
               Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then
               stops. He collapses back. Almost ashamed of what he's done.
               Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant
               heavily. The rain dies down.
               Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother.
               He suddenly STOPS and looks back at Leo, small in the
               distance.
               CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up
               to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight
               back... but is too wiped from Raph.
               GATO POV - "reading" Leo on the ground. He frowns.

                                   GENERAL GATO
                         It is neither monster nor human.
               CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile.

                                   GENERAL AGUILA
                         Then he shall perfectly serve our
                         purposes... let us inform our
                         commander that the final creature
                         has been captured.
               ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets
               TRANQUILIZED with the Generals' dart cannon.

                                   RAPHAEL

                         LEO!!!
               Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and
               drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and
               catch his brother.

                                   RAPHAEL

                         L
                          eo!!! Hang on!!
               But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph.

                         NOOOOOOOO!!!!
               Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The
               sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TURTLES LAIR - TRAINING DOJO

               Raphael walks to Splinter, practicing himself in the dojo.
               Raph holds his Sais in one hand, his bolo chain in the other.
               Clenches both tight.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael? What is the matter?

                                   RAPHAEL

                             (RANTING)
                         I was out, and did... something...
                         something happened and I- ARRRGH!!!
               Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo.
               Splinter is unfazed, but he won't take any more.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael! Kneel.
               Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to
               Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         I did something... I did something
                         really stupid, Master Splinter.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Go on...

                                   RAPHAEL

                             (SEMI-RAMBLING)
                         I know why you chose him now. I
                         know that there's a reason why he's
                         the better son and I'm not.

                             (THINKS)
                         And I think I made things worse
                         tonight.
                             (beat - calming down)
                         A WHOLE lot worse... I know you
                         must be ashamed of me, father.
               Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of
               Raph.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael. You always bear the
                         world's problems on your shoulders.
                         It is an admirable quality when you
                         are a protector of others...
                plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder.

          

                                                                       74.

          

          

          

                                   SPLINTER
                         But you must realize that while, at
                         times, you may not be my favorite
                         student, it does not mean that you
                         are my least favorite son.
               Raphael looks up. Having not thought of it that way.

                                   SPLINTER
                         You are strong, passionate and
                         loyal to a fault. These are the
                         merits of a great leader as well...
                         but only when tempered with
                         compassion and humility.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         But Master Splinter, I messed up
                         big tonight... I mean BIG.
               Splinter chews on this.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Leonardo? R

                         Yes.
               Splinter is grim. Nods. But he moves on.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Well then, I believe your brothers
                         may be in need of a leader.
               Raphael looks up. Finally, his shot. He holds his SAIS in one
               hand, and his BOLO CHAIN in the other. Ninja Turtle vs.
               Nightwatcher. He grips them both hard. He drops the chain.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Thank you... father.

                    But without Leo... what do we do?
          No one answers. Splinter looks to Raph. Raph steps up.

               DARK STORM CLOUDS gather over Winters Tower. A horrible
               electrical storm is brewing.

               The lobby has changed. Shots establishing the jury-rigged
               nature of Winters Tower.
               - The large Aztec-like calendar on the lobby floor suddenly
               SPLITS and slides open, creating a 100 foot circle in the
               middle. Underneath is the TOWERS CELL BASEMENT.

               -
                 The   disk in the basement is suddenly RAISED up to the lobby
               area,   replacing the slick marble design with an antiquated
               stone   version. Only now, THIRTEEN CREATURE CELLS surround the
               disk.   Very ceremonial.
               - Finally, Winters' office elevator LOWERS from high above.
               He's in the actual ceremonial gear worn by Yaotl years ago.
               He holds the helmet to his side. Very serious. He looks over
               his now-ceremonial lobby... satisfied.
                 PUSH IN on one cell, as Leo sits hunched over, unconscious
               and helpless...

               Quick shots of April and Casey gearing up. Casey with his off-
               the-shelf sporting gear. April with sleek-looking Japanese
               combat gear and weaponry.
               They both emerge from their rooms, dressed to kill. Casey's
               jaw drops as we scope out April.

                                     CASEY
                           Wow.

                           Oh... oh yeah.
               They share the moment. Seeing what they forgot about each
               other when they first met. It's enough for them to smile.

                         Mask? What mask?
               April runs into the other room and comes back with her hands
               behind her back. She takes out a NEW MASK for Casey - cool,
               crisp and a badass paintjob.

               Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss

               We finally get to see how much of an ass-kicker Master
               Splinter is. Same with April, who squares off against Karai.
               They fight hard. April ends up cornered, about to be skewered
               by her blade when...
               -CLUNK! She wobbles and then passes out. When Karai falls out
               of frame, she reveals CASEY JONES a hundred yards behind her
               holding his HOCKEY STICK! April frowns.

               Mikey fights the most like Jackie Chan - comical maneuvers
               backed by solid-hitting blows. Don uses his bo-staff in 1001
               different ways, both offensively and defensively.
               Casey is enjoying the hell out of it. High flying, adrenaline
               rush. He even catches April checking him out, and vice versa.
               April suddenly spots an opening to the front doors!

                                   APRIL
                         Guys! Front door is open. Now!

               Winters is happy. He looks up to the heavens. Checks a time
               piece. Winters begins chanting ANCIENT MAGICK/SPELLS. Looks
               up through the opening in the middle of the building.

               The cam PULLS UP through the building. Up over NYC. Through
               the clouds... and into space until we pass all ALIGNED STARS.

               S
                PACE - The final star drifts into position. A LIGHT BURST
               EFFECT travels down each star, headed to Earth.
               BACK IN LOBBY - The light burst flies into the lobby and hits
               the circle in the middle of all the monsters' cells.
               ON CIRCLE - The pieces suddenly start to move around. Almost
               like a sliding puzzle. Then they start to randomly SINK
               further into the ground. Light pours out of them, until all
               of them give way to create THE PORTAL.
               POV OFFICE ABOVE - Each of the Thirteen Cells LIGHT UP to
               acknowledge their contents. 1... 2... 3...

                         What?
               His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it
               hits him like a ton of bricks. He turns to the Generals...

                                   WINTERS

          Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is
          DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as...

          back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only

               Winters' body still lays on the floor. This is bad.

                         Is he... is he dead?
               Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes
               Winters' limp body. Nothing.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yup. He's WAY dead, dude.
               WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room.
               ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in
               his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine!
               Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice
               those around him.

                                   WINTERS

               Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts
               them at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in
               awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him.

               Winters collapses on the floor. Head in hands.

                         This was our chance. We could have
                         changed it all.

               The same red-tinted battlefield we left in Winter's
               flashback. Monsters are leaping through the hoards.

                         There are things, Miss O'Neil, no
                         one could possibly know...
               Camera pushes in on YAOTL and his Four Generals high on a
               hill, surveying the action.
               ON YAOTL - He takes off his helmet... IT'S WINTERS HIMSELF.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         It was I who stood on that
                         battlefield all those years ago.
               Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He
               looks shocked, surprised.
               A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a
               ceremonial SHAMAN from their enemies' camp.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         And we had to pay a price.
               The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled
               up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see
               him become... grayer.
                N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They
               scream, slowly turned into STONE. Cracks form on their
               bodies, light shooting out of it.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         We were cursed that day. My four
                         comrades-in-arms were turned into

                    committed.
          ON WINTERS - He stands on the battlefield. Alone. As he
          walks, the CAM MOVES around him. During this, we X-DISSOLVE
          BETWEEN A FEW SELECT TIME PERIODS between then and now.

                    My curse was to live... forever. To
                    feel the pain of losing love time
                    and time again. Of boredom. The
                    pain... of time.
           ACK IN PRESENT DAY. Winters stops walking...

                              WINTERS
                    We were doomed to live this way
                    until, as the Shaman put it, "you
                    corrected the mistakes of your
                    past".

                    That's what this is about. Penance,

                    chance to right our wrongs.

                    And now, our Master has tired of
                    feeding on the nectar of life. Of
                    loving his entire life. Of FEELING.
                        (gestures to portal)
                    So he prefers to end it all. End
                    HIS "misery" at the expense of
                    ours.
          Aguila walks to the cells. The portal writhes in the bg,
          sinking into the floor.

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                    But thanks to his cunning, his
                    technology, we are now capable of
                    LIVING... we have now become-
                        (close, creepy)
                    - gods.

                              GENERAL SERPIENTE
                    And we shall finish what we began
                    all those years ago. We will
                    finally have our victory.

                              GENERAL GATO
                    Even with one monster still free,
                    the curse can never be broken!

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                        (to Winters)
                    Join us. Join us Yaotl, and live a
                    life eternal with us at your side!
          ON WINTERS - He waits. A beat.

                              WINTERS
                    Never. This was our opportunity! We
                    were wrong! Don't you understand?!

                               GENERAL AGUILA

                    NO! YOU WERE WRONG.

                         BEAT)
                    And you are weak.

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                        (to Karai)
                    Destroy them.
          Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the
          very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and
          her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS -
          military/ninja style.

          

                                                                          87.

          

          

          

                                   APRIL
                         What does THAT mean?

                                   KARAI
                         It means we're going to help you.
               WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building,
               leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind.

                                   KARAI
                         My soldiers will find the
                         thirteenth monster. And you will
                         bring it back here. Hurry - we
                         don't have much time.
               Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still
               hurting. April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind
               with the Four Foot. They run out into the garden, just in
               time to see the other Foot disappear into the night.

                                   CASEY
                         I got shotgun!
               BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles
               quickly look at one another. Know what they have to do.
               They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his
               backstabbing Generals.
               Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him,
               defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         If you mess with one of us-
                             (looks around)
                         -you mess with all of us.
               Aguila smiles at their chutzpa.

                                   GENERAL AGUILA
                         Challenge accepted.
          97   The Portal worsens behind them. Sound and sight. The Eight 97
               are ready to fight.
               ...and the fight BEGINS! The Turtles leap, pounce and strike
               with all the exuberance and intensity they've ever had.
               Winters moves to help the Turtles.
               Suddenly a WALKING STICK across his chest stops him!

                                   SPLINTER
                         They must face them alone. As
                         brothers.
               Winters debates it in his head for a beat - WHAM! - a
               tentacle from the portal slams down next to him!

          

                                                                          88.

                         Alright. We have more important
                         things to do!
               ON PORTAL - A small DEMON makes its way out of the portal!
               Winters runs and flips through the air and then CLOBBERS IT
               with his bare hands, sending it back down!
               He lands on the other side.

                                   WINTERS
                         Help me push the cells into the
                         portal!
               Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some
               smackdown on any emerging creature out of the portal.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          

          

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS


          98                                                                98

                                   CASEY (O.S.)
                         This has got to be the suckiest
                         vehicle to save the world with.
               - as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner. Tinkling
               musical notes chime along with the speed. Appropriately lame
               and embarrassing.
               INSIDE VAN - Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are
               crammed in the back. Awkward silence.

                                   CASEY
                         So... anybody from out of town?

                E BEGIN TO INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LOBBY FIGHT,

               AND CASEY/APRIL MONSTER CHASE...
               LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle.
               Utter commotion. Mikey is paired with Serpiente.
               Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick
               speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue.
               Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo
               lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo's knocked
               shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with
               swords and bladed weapons of all kinds.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Come to daddy.
               MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action.
               Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body. He
               pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight.

          Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS.
          It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be
          aware of their environment to avoid defeat.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Sensei! How you guys doing?!
          ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in.
          About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes
          out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems
          to be having FUN.

                              SPLINTER
                    Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL!
          BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC.

                              KARAI
                    My troops have located the final
                    monster. At the harbor docks.

                               ASEY
                    Oh, I got this one covered.
          Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD
          THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES
          over the harbor warehouses until we see -
          - the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE.
          It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking
          out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene.

          I
           NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at
          each other.

                               ASEY
                    Huh. Now there's somethin' you
                    don't see every day...
          They pile out of the van.

                              CASEY
                        (off of monster)
                    Well, I guess we have to figure out
                    how to get handsome here back to
                    Winters' Tower.

                              KARAI
                    We should tie it to the van and
                    drag it back.

                              CASEY
                    Wow. You're... hard core.
          ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body.
          As he turns his head he doesn't see THE CREATURE'S EYE OPEN!

          

                                                                  90.

          

          

          
          WIDER - The creature stands up as everyone turns to see. The
          creature DOG SHAKES his hide, sending the tranq darts flying
          everywhere! They slam into the walls like shrapnel.
          ON FOOT - As they dive out of the way. One gets hit with a
          dart in the chest. Looks down. Passes out.

                                CASEY
                    Incoming!
          ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA
          THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door!
          ON CREATURE - He's now standing... and dying to chase
          something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van!
          Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling
          back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the
          creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end
          and spin the vehicle around.

                              APRIL

                    FAST! GO FAST NOW!!!
          Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away!
          STARS IN SKY - Karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of
          alignment. Losing time fast.
          BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the
          last full cell.
          ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.
          In the BG, dozens of winged DEMONS fly around inside.

                              LEONARDO
                    They better hurry with that last
                    monster!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I'm sure my man Casey's got it all
                    under control...

                              LEONARDO
                    That's what I'm afraid of.
          BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his
          guts out.

                              CASEY

                    I GOTTA TELL YA... I'M, UH, I'M

                    STILL NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS THE

                    BEST IDEA!!!!
          WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE
          BAIT to attract the creature! It's working too! The creature
          pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April drives.

          Casey is throwing SPORTS EQUIPMENT at it from his large
          hockey bag. The creature is catching and eating it all.
          INSIDE VAN - Casey slips in.

                              APRIL
                    What are you doing in here?!

                              CASEY
                    Ran outta food.
          They all look out the back window as the creature pounds
          closer and closer...
          BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill.
          Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals.

                               APHAEL
                    Listen. I'm the last guy to sound
                    like a TV cartoon, but I think we
                    need to work together.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Teamwork. The more you know...
          Don clocks Mikey behind the head.

                              LEONARDO

                        (TEASING)
                    Why Raph, no solo act tonight?
          Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM.
          They trust one another, and their efficiency shows.
          ON PORTAL - More tentacles begin to come out. More claws
          surround the surface edges.
          ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as
          one. The way they should. They way they will from now on.
          ON SPLINTER - As cam PUSHES IN, he stands up. Seeing his
          sons. As one. As BROTHERS. He smiles.

                              SPLINTER
                    Yes. Yes, my sons.
          The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to
          make mistakes the TMNT take advantage of.
          ON WINTERS - Sees the portal light beginning to SHRINK!
          Because of the TMNT's moves, the Generals are now on the
          precipice of the Portal, being pulled back. They struggle to
          stand.
          The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a
          whirlwind and screaming Monsters.

                      Roger dodger, dude.
          The   TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch
          and   take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into
          the   PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils
          and   pulled back!
          The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.
          Silent. Splinter runs over to them.

                                SPLINTER
                      My sons, I am so proud of you all.
          Then - BOOM! - the Generals' ARMS slam onto the ridge of the
          portal - BEGINNING TO CLIMB OUT! The Turtles jump back.

                                TURTLES

                      WAAAHHHHH/OHMIGOD!/WHOOAAA!!!

                                GENERAL AGUILA
                      Silly children. We are immortals
                      made of stone! The Earth has only
                      BEGUN to feel our wrath!
          The brothers are screwed. They can't stop the Generals. Until-
          BEHIND TURTLES - Glowing headlights grow larger. Closer. As -
          KERSMASH!!! The Van flies through the lobby, musical chime
          and all, being trailed by the Creature! April clips a corner
          as the vehicle spins out of the path.
           he Creature tries to stop, but can't on the marble floor. It
          falls, sliding, clicking its claws trying to stop!

                                  WINTERS

                      LOOK OUT!
          Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the
          Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the
          Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back
          into the Portal!
          ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle.
          ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get
          out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken...
          and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them.

          

                                                                  93.

          

          

          
          Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal.

                              GENERAL AGUILA

                    YOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE-
          WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I thought he'd never shut up.
          WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    HOLY CRAP!!!

                                 RAPHAEL

                    WE DID IT!

                              TURTLES

                    YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!
          The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud.
          ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles
          out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a
          very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out
          last beside them.

                              CASEY
                        (caught - looks at both)
                    Oh. I, uh -
          HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks.

                              APRIL
                    Don't try to tell me for one second
                    that you didn't enjoy tha-
          Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like
          they should have been kissing all along.
          They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing
          MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    AWWWWWW....
          Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers
          again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment.
          Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and
          the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps
          forward -

                              KARAI
                    You are every bit the warriors I
                    was informed you were. You have
                    passed.

          

                                                                  94.

          

          

          
          ON TMNT - they're confused.

                              LEONARDO
                    Passed what?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You know us?

                              KARAI
                    I've known OF you for some time.
                        (beat, to Leo's question)
                    Savor your victory tonight. For
                    soon we will have further business
                    together.

                              SPLINTER
                    What kind of business?

                              KARAI
                    The kind that involves familiar
                    faces from your past...
          ON TURTLES - They all look at each other.

                              RAPHAEL
                    She doesn't mean...
          They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED.
          Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner.
          Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Winters?
          ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned.
          Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is
          spotted red with his M
                               own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek.

                               ICHAELANGELO
                    I'm never usually that happy to be
                    bleeding.

                              DONATELLO
                    You would be if you were an
                    immortal who couldn't bleed for
                    three thousand years...
          Winters looks at all the Turtles.

                              WINTERS
                    Thank you. Thank you from the
                    bottom of my heart. You've made a
                    very old man, very very happy.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    So, um, what happens now?

                ON WINTERS - He just SMILES. Content. Finally at peace. As he
                ages thousands of years in front of us... eventually turning
                to DUST and blowing away.

                                    MICHAELANGELO
                          Okay... just a little bit creepy.

                              (SNEEZES)

                CAM PULLS BACK, out of the building, onto the street. See the
                destruction. The clearing skies. THE SUNRISE.

                                                                    UT TO:

                Raph comes to Splinter's room.

                                     APHAEL
                          You wanted to see me Sensei?

                          Sit down, Raphael.

                                    RAPHAEL
                          Thank you, Master Splinter, for
                          your guidance.
                              (thinks, humble)
                          I can only hope that one day, I
                          will be able to begin the next
                          stage of my training like Leo.
                Splinter smiles. Reaches into a box and takes out a similar
                MEDALLION to the one given to Leonardo.

                                     SPLINTER
                          That, my son, you already have.

                              (BEAT)
                          Our training works in mysterious
                          ways. But the answer that lies in
                          all our questions... is family.
                Raph beams as he accepts the "badge". He excitedly stands up.
                Splinter looks to the hallway where his eyes meet Leo's. They
                exchange knowing smiles as Splinter winks and we-

                A ROCKIN' NUMBER PLAYS as we cap everyone's adventures.
                Splinter walks through the lair. It's empty. He walks past
                their "trophy room". He places the ornate head of WINTERS'
                CANE on the shelf.

                APRIL'S POV INSIDE HELMET - We see a small DIAMOND RING taped
                to the visor. She takes it off. Beaming. Models it on her
                hand. She leans forward.

                                    RAPHAEL (V.O.)
                          So what makes a family? Personally,
                          it's more than sharing a roof or a
                          bathroom. It's sharing life... My
                          father taught me that, and I think
                          it's pretty much true... y'know,
                          provided that you don't kill each
                          other in the process. Or that no
                          one touches your stuff. Or makes
                          loud noises when you're trying to
                          sleep. Or...

                They run close to the camera, once again, a family.

                                    RAPHAEL (V.O.)
                          Hey, nobody said it was easy.

                And as RAPHAEL and LEONARDO leap toward camera, we-

                         "TOY STORY"

FADE IN:

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They
are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the
impression of sky.

One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED"
poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.

A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The
VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting
out all the voices of the scene.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Alright everyone, this is a stick-
            up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty
            that safe!

A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the
"BANK" box.

Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.
Potato Head kisses the coins.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.
                   (kissing noises)


A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought
into the scene.

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old
            potato!

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get
            run over!

The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a
Hot Wheels track loop.

                         ANDY (AS SHEEP)
            Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do
            something!

WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene
opposite the inanimate spud.

Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.

Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Are you gonna come quietly?

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            You can't touch me Sheriff!  I
            brought my attack dog with a built-
            in force field!

Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in
front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who
            eats force field dogs!!

Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the
Slinky Dog.

                         ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)
            AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!

                         ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)
            YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            You're goin' to jail, Bart.

Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib
in the room.

A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "JAIL"
written in crayon.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Say good-bye to the wife and
            tatertots.

Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.
Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to
pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,
forcing some of his parts loose.

Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the
floor.

                         ANDY
                   (pulling Woody's string)
            You saved the day again, Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            You're my favorite deputy.

BEGIN TITLES

SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does
various activities with Woody:

-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows
drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends
Woody is lassoing the cattle.

                         ANDY
            C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.

-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)
car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib.

INT. STAIRWELL

-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister
allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and
catches him at the bottom.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM

-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around
and around.

Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.

Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.

                         ANDY
                   (raising his arms)
            Score!

SONG ENDS

Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to
his mother.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  Cool!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Whadda ya think?

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANGLE: THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM

MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just
finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A
banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: "Happy
Birthday Andy."

Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
decorations.

                         ANDY
            Can we leave this up 'til we move?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Well, sure, we can leave it up.

                         ANDY
            Yeah!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Now go get Molly.  Your friends are
            going to be here any minute.

                         ANDY
            Okay.

Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.

                         ANDY
            It's party time, Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging
Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat
at her.

                         ANDY
            Howdy, Little Lady!

He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last
time.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.

                         ANDY
                   (picking up Molly)
            C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting
            heavy!
                   (to Woody)
            See ya later, Woody.

Andy exits.

END TITLES

Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his
expression changing from a smile to worry.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pull my string!  The birthday
            party's today?!

Woody thinks.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.

The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the
closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.

POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits
himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ages three and up.  It's on my box.
            Ages three and up!  I'm not
            supposed to be babysitting Princess
            Drool.

HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin
slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces
are in the wrong slots.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!
                         HAMM
            I don't get it.

Hamm walks away.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You uncultured swine!
                   (to someone O.S.)
            What are you looking at, ya hockey
            puck?!

Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.

Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on
the night stand.

                         WOODY
            Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

                         SARGENT
                   (saluting)
            Sir!  No Sir!

                         WOODY
            Okay, thank you.  At ease.

Woody hops off the bed.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Slinky?

                         SLINKY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody!

A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing
out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on
the board.

                         SLINKY
            I'm red this time.

                         WOODY
            No, Slink --

                         SLINKY
            Oh...well alright, you can be red
            if you want.

                         WOODY
            Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad
            news.

                         SLINKY
            Bad news?!

                         WOODY
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!

Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in
the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Just gather everyone up for a staff
            meeting and be happy!!

                         SLINKY
            Got it.

Slinky shuffles off.

                         WOODY
            Be HAPPY!

Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.

Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy
ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Staff meeting, everybody.
                   (aside)
            Snake, Robot -- podium duty.

Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly
follow Woody.

Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other
direction.

                         WOODY
            Hey Etch!  Draw!

Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.

Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch
etches a gun on its screen.

                         WOODY
                   (pretending to be shot)
            Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've
            been working on that draw.  Fastest
            knobs in the west.

Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            Got a staff meeting, you guys, come
            on, let's go!

Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of
Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.

                         WOODY
            Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,
            who moved my doodle pad way over here?

Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...

REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.

                         REX
            ROOAAAARR!!!

                         WOODY
                   (unaffected)
            Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

Rex suddenly turns timid.

                         REX
            Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

                         WOODY
            I was close to being scared that time.

Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.

                         REX
            I'm going for fearsome here, but I
            just don't feel it.  I think I'm
            just coming off as annoying.

A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO
PEEP, the porcelain figurine.

                         WOODY
                   (choking)
            Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

                         BO PEEP
            I wanted to thank you, Woody, for
            saving my flock.

                         WOODY
                   (blushing)
            Oh, hey - it was nothing.

                         BO PEEP
            Whadda ya say I get someone else to
            watch the sheep tonight?

                         WOODY
                   (very flustered)
            Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of
ABC blocks.

                         BO PEEP
            Remember, I'm just a couple of
            blocks away.

Woody is left lovestruck.

All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up
            front.

Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody!  C'mon!

Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.

The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and
indicates his microphone.

                         MIKE
            Ahem!

                         WOODY
                   (grabbing microphone)
            Oh, thanks, Mike.
                   (to the crowd)
            Okay --

SFX: FEEDBACK

                         WOODY
                   (to Mike)
            Oh, whoa, step back --

Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.

                         WOODY
            Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.
            Everybody hear me?  Up on the
            shelf, can you hear me?  Great!
            Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.
            Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

The toys all MOAN.

                         HAMM
            Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!

                         REX
            Well I didn't know we were supposed
            to have one already.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (waving his arm out
                   its socket)
            Do we have to hold hands?

The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a
            big joke.  We've only got one week
            left before the move.  I don't want
            any toys left behind.  A moving
            buddy -- if you don't have one, get
            one!
                   (checking the pad)
            Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.
            Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion
            Awareness" meeting was, I think, a
            big success and we want to thank Mr.
            Spell for putting that on for us.
            Thank you, Mr. Spell.

The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr. Spell's display
screen as he speaks.

                         MR. SPELL
            You're welcome.

                         WOODY
            Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note
            here...
                   (under his breath)
            Andy's birthday party's been moved
            to today.
                   (full voice)
            Next we have --

The toys all PANIC.

                         REX
            What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's
            today?!  His birthday's not 'til
            next week!!

                         HAMM
            What's going on down there?  Is Mom
            losing her marbles?!

                         WOODY
            Well, obviously she wanted to have
            the party before the move.  I'm not
            worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Of course Woody ain't worried!
            He's been Andy's favorite since
            kindergarten!

                         SLINKY
            Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!
            If Woody says it's all right, then,
            well, darnit, it's good enough for
            me.  Woody has never steered us
            wrong before.

While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and
mimes kissing his own butt.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and
            birthday we go through this.

                         REX
            But what if Andy gets another
            dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just
            don't think I can take that kind of
            rejection.

                         WOODY
            Hey, listen, no one's getting
            replaced.  This is Andy we're
            talking about.

Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            It doesn't matter how much we're
            played with.  What matters is that
            we're here for Andy when he needs
            us.  That's what we're made for.
            Right?
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.

                         HAMM
            Pardon me.  I hate to break up the
            staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!
            Birthday guests at three o'clock!

                         WOODY
            Stay calm, everyone!!

Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards
the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.

                         WOODY
            Uh, meeting adjourned.

The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get
a peek outside.

                         HAMM
            Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at
            all those presents?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I can't see a thing!

Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out
of his head and holds them up over the other toys.

ANGLE: TOY'S POV OF ANDY'S FRONT YARD

CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.

                         HAMM
            Yessir, we're next month's garage
            sale fodder for sure.

                         REX
                   (panicked)
            Any dinosaur-shaped ones?

                         HAMM
            Ah, for crying out loud, they're
            all in boxes, you idiot!

The presents keep coming.

                         REX
            They're getting bigger.

                         SLINKY
            Wait!  There's a nice little one
            over there!

At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but
then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  The
toys SCREAM.

                         MR. SPELL
            Spell the word "trashcan."

                         REX
            We're doomed!

Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in
surrender.

                         WOODY
            Alright!  Alright!

The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            If I send out the troops, will you
            all calm down?

                         REX
            Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

                         WOODY
            Okay, save your batteries!

                         HAMM
            Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using
            the old noodle.

Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on
the nightstand.

                         WOODY
            Sargent.  Establish a recon post
            downstairs.  Code red.  You know
            what to do.

                         SARGENT
            Yes SIR!

The green army man hops down to the floor where a "BUCKET O'
SOLDIERS" sits.

                         SARGENT
            Alright men, you heard him.  Code
            Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!
            Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!
            Let's move move move!!

THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in
formation across the bedroom floor.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for
the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.

The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars.

ANGLE: SARGENT'S BINOCULAR VIEW OF DOWNSTAIRS

Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway
rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the
            living room.  It's almost time for
            the presents.

Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the
Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.

TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting
down to the floor below.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,
then give the "all clear" sign.

The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed
the receiving half of the baby monitor.

                         WOODY
            And this --
                   (turning on the baby monitor)
            -- is how we find out what is in
            those presents.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

The green army men march in formation across the floor when
suddenly...

SFX: FOOTSTEPS

Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze
in their various classic action poses.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the
            chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and
            Barbeque --

The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top
of a soldier.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,
            I thought I told him to pick these up.

With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of
her path and continues on to the living room.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

                         REX
            Shouldn't they be there by now?
            What's taking them so long?!

                         WOODY
            Hey, these guys are professionals.
            They're the best.  C'mon, they're
            not lying down on the job.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room.

The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The
Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.

                         WOUNDED SOLDIER
                   (moans)
            Go on without me.  Just go!

                         SLINKY
            A good soldier never leaves a man
            behind.

The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower
themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once
downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant.  Suddenly...

A BALL

bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor.

The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS

While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates
the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal.

The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF BIRTHDAY PRESENTS

The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room
coffee table.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
            There they are.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby
monitor.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha
            Bravo.

                         WOODY
            This is it!  This is it!  Quiet,
            quiet, quiet!

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Mother Bird.
            Alright...Andy's opening the first
            present now.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (chanting)
            Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato
            Head...Mrs. Potato Head...
                   (off Rex's look)
            Hey, I can dream, can't I?

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            The bow's coming off...he's ripping
            the wrapping paper...it's
            a...it's...it's a lunchbox!  We've
            got a lunchbox, here!

                         WOODY
            A lunchbox?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            A lunchbox...?!

                         SLINKY
            For lunch.  Heh heh heh...

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Ok, second present...it appears to
            be...okay, it's bed sheets.

The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.

                         HAMM
            Yeah, alright!!

Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,
sending his facial features flying.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, watch it!

                         SLINKY
            I knew you were right all along,
            Woody.  Never doubted you for a
            second.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT

The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we
            have here?!

The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF LIVING ROOM

Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out
another large present.

cutting off the Sargent.

                         REX
            It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!

Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the
monitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteries
to roll out.

                         REX
            Oh, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never

                   (sarcastic)
            Way to go, Rex.

Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  Potato Head tries to
correctly insert the batteries.

                         WOODY
            No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em

Head aside.

            Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear?
            Did you see my ear?

            Outta my way!  Here I come, here I
            come --

Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.

Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPS
grow louder.

Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...

Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's
feet rush in.

                         FRIEND #1
            Hey, look!  His lasers light up.
                         ANDY
            Take that, Zurg!

Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down
the gap between the bed and the back wall.

                         FRIEND #2
            Quick!  Make a space!  This is
            where the spaceship lands.

            games!  We've got prizes!

                         ANDY
            Oh, yeah!

The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE
DOOR behind them.

BEAT

The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            What is it?

                         BO PEEP
            Can you see it?

                         SLINKY
            What the heck is up there?

                         REX
            Woody?  Who's up there with you?

Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shocked
to discover him there.

                         SLINKY
            Woody, what are you doing under the
            bed?

                         WOODY
                   (composing himself)
            Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing.
            I'm sure Andy was just a little
            excited, that's all.  Too much cake
            and ice cream, I suppose.  It's
            just a mistake.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in
            your spot, Woody.

                         REX
                   (GASP!)
            Have you been replaced?

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What did I tell you earlier?
            No one is getting replaced.

The toys give each other a look of doubt.

                         WOODY
            Now let's all be polite, and give
            whatever it is up there a nice, big
            "Andy's Room" welcome.

Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the
edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...

BUZZ LIGHTYEAR

We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age
action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head
to toe.  The imposing "G.I. Joe-sized" doll stands heroically
in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.

Woody GULPS.

Buzz comes alive and looks around.

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

While he scans the bedroom a "DARTH VADER" LIKE BREATHING is
heard.

Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.

SFX: ELECTRONIC BEEP

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
            Come in, Star Command.

Nothing.  He pushes the button again.

                         BUZZ
            Star Command - come in.  Do you
            read me?
                   (to himself)
            Why don't they answer?!!
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  The
box is designed to look like a spaceship.

                         BUZZ
                   (GASP)
            My ship!!

He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.

                         BUZZ
            Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!

Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
            Stardate 4072: My ship has run off
            course en route to sector 12.  I've
            crash landed on a strange planet.
            The impact must have awoken me from
            hyper-sleep.

Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            Terrain seems a bit unstable...

He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            No read-out yet if the air is
            breathable... and there seems to be
            no sign of intelligent life
            anywhere --

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

Woody's face suddenly pops into view.

                         WOODY
            Hello-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            HO-YAAAHH!!!

Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.  He presses a
button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on
his wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and
holds it there.

                         WOODY
            Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I
            frighten you?  Didn't mean to.
            Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody
            and this is Andy's room.  That's
            all I wanted to say, and also,
            there has been a bit of a mix-up.
            This is my spot, see, the bed here --

While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on
Woody's vest.

                         BUZZ
                   (de-activating his
                   laser beam)
            Local law enforcement!  It's about
            time you got here.  I'm Buzz
            Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe
            Protection Unit.  My ship has crash
            landed here by mistake.

Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.
Woody tries to keep up.

                         WOODY
            Yes, it is a mistake, because, you
            see, the bed, here, is my spot.

                         BUZZ
            I need to repair my turbo boosters.
            Do you people still use fossil
            fuels, or have you discovered
            crystalic fusion?

                         WOODY
            Well, let's see, we've got double
            A's --

                         BUZZ
            Watch yourself!!

Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist
laser.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Halt!  Who goes there?!

The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.

                         REX
            Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!

                         BUZZ
                   (to Woody)
            Do you know these life forms?

                         WOODY
            Yes.  They're Andy's toys.

                         BUZZ
            Alright, everyone.  You're clear to
            come up.

Buzz walks over to the toys.

                         BUZZ
            I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.

Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.

                         REX
            Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you...
                   (pulls away)
            Now thank you all for your kind
            welcome.

                         REX
            Say!  What's that button do?

                         BUZZ
            I'll show you.

Buzz presses a button on his chest.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

The toys all GASP IN AWE.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody's got something like
            that.  His is a pullstring, only
            it --

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

                         HAMM
            Oh yeah, but not like this one.
            This is a quality sound system.
            Probably all copper wiring, huh?
            So, uh, where are you from?
            Singapore?  Hong Kong?

                         BUZZ
            Well...no, actually I'm stationed
            up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector
            4.  As a member of the elite
            Universe Protection Unit of the
            Space Ranger Corps, I protect the
            galaxy from the threat of invasion
            from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn
            enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz
arrived.

ANGLE: BACK OF BUZZ'S BOX

There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word-
for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.

                         REX
            And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not
            actually  from Mattel, I'm actually
            from a smaller company that was
            purchased in a leveraged buy-out.
            Well, I don't really understand the
            financials, but...

Woody walks over to Bo Peep.

                         WOODY
            You'd think they've never seen a
            new toy before.

                         BO PEEP
            Well sure, look at him.  He's got
            more gadgets on him then a Swiss
            army knife.

Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his
laser light.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You
            don't want to be in the way when my
            laser goes off.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, a laser!  How come you don't
            have a laser, Woody?

                         WOODY
            It's not a laser!  It's a little
            lightbulb that blinks!

                         HAMM
            What's with him?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Laser-envy.

                         WOODY
            All right, that's enough.  Look,
            we're all very impressed with
            Andy's new toy --

                         BUZZ
            Toy?

                         WOODY
            T-O-Y.  Toy.

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me, I think the word you're
            searching for is Space Ranger.

                         WOODY
            The word I'm searching for I can't
            say because there's pre-school toys
            present.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

                         REX
            Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm
            curious.  What does a Space Ranger
            actually do?

                         WOODY
            He's not a Space Ranger!  He
            doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers
            or fly --

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me.

Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.

Again the toys GASP IN AWE.

                         HAMM
            Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!

                         WOODY
            Oh, what?!...What?!  These are
            plastic.  He can't fly!

                         BUZZ
            They are a terillium-carbonic alloy
            and I CAN fly.

                         WOODY
            No, you can't.

                         BUZZ
            Yes, I can.

                         WOODY
            You can't!

                         BUZZ
            Can!

                         WOODY
            Can't!  Can't!  Can't!

                         BUZZ
            I tell you, I could fly around this
            room with my eyes closed!

                         WOODY
            Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.

                         BUZZ
            All right, then, I will.
                   (to toys)
            Stand back everyone!

The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the
edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost.  He poses like a
high diver, shuts his eyes...

                         BUZZ
            To infinity and beyond!!

...and leaps off the bed.

Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and
bounces right back up.

He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the
track, through the loop, and off a ramp.  Buzz soars upward
into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.

Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.  The impact
turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around
and around.

All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.

Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from
the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.

Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and
then opens his eyes.

                         BUZZ
            Can.

The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH
ADORATION.

                         REX
            Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew
            magnificently!

                         BO PEEP
            I found my moving buddy!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you.  Thank you all.
            Thank you.

                         WOODY
            That wasn't flying!  That was
            falling with style!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Man, the dolls must really go for
            you!
                   (aside)
            Can you teach me that?

Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.
Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.

                         SLINKY
            Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --

                         WOODY
            Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,
            everything will be just the way it
            was.  They'll see... they'll see.
            I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

MONTAGE

SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER

A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,
running around the room.

B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.  Next he "lands" Buzz
Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's
laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if
he'd been blown away by the laser.

C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and
cowboy pajamas.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:

Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas
and a homemade spaceman's helmet.

                         ANDY
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom
transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the
wall, the pillow, the bedspread.

E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space ranger
suggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this
time giving a "JURASSIC PARK" ROAR.

The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.

F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of
Buzz.

Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's
hair, chatting away like a hair dresser.

Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.

G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys
as weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,
using his feet as a treadmill.

Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends
up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the
barbell.

H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the
checkerboard.

Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and
Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on
top of ABC blocks for repair.

In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the
pieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the
dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.

I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is
stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's
wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.

Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his
front end no choice but to eventually follow.

J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until
just Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which
toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next
to him.

Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks
back into the box, closing the lid to...

The black screen splits horizontally to become...

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - MORNING - WOODY'S POV OF THE BEDROOM
FROM THE TOY BOX

All is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lid
of the toy box.

                         WOODY
            Finally!

He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers
that his hat is missing.

                         WOODY
                   (looking back into
                   the toy box)
            Hey!  Who's got my hat?

The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.

                         SHARK
            Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!

                         WOODY
                   (sarcastic)
            Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!
                   (grabs the hat)
            Give me that!

Woody leaps out of the toy box.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.
            Let me show you something.  It
            looks as though I've been accepted
            into your culture.

Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his
            name on me.

Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the
sole of his boot.

The name "ANDY" is written on it in permanent marker.

                         SLINKY & REX
            Wow!

                         REX
            With permanent ink, too!

                         BUZZ
            Well, I must get back to repairing
            my ship.

Buzz walks away.

Woody looks at HIS foot -- "Andy" is written on it also but
in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.

                         BO PEEP (O.S.)
            Don't let it get to you, Woody.

Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly
straightens up.

                         WOODY
                   (nonchalant)
            Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what
            do you mean?  Who?

                         BO PEEP
            I know Andy's excited about Buzz,
            but you know, he'll always have a
            special place for you.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (walking past)
            Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

                         WOODY
            Alright!  That's it!

Woody angrily marches across the room.

Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the
ABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under
the ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waiting
for instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.

                         BUZZ
            Unidirectional bonding strip.

Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape
dispenser.

                         ROBOT
            Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!

Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.

Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot
and rolls him out from under the ship.

                         WOODY
            Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away
            from Andy.  He's mine, and no one
            is taking him away from me.

                         BUZZ
            What are you talking about?
                   (to Robot)
            Where's that bonding strip?!

Buzz rolls himself back under.  Woody rolls him out again.

                         WOODY
            And another thing.  Stop with this
            spaceman thing.  It's getting on my
            nerves.

                         BUZZ
            Are you saying you want to lodge a
            complaint with Star Command?
                         WOODY
            Oh okay, so you want to do it the
            hard way, huh?

Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Don't even think about it, cowboy!

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, tough guy?!

Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a
button that makes the spaceman's helmet open.

Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.  He drops to his knees
and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.

Woody is unsure how to react.

Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.

                         BUZZ
            The air isn't toxic.

Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.

                         BUZZ
            How dare you open a spaceman's
            helmet on an uncharted planet!  My
            eyeballs could've been sucked from
            their sockets!

Buzz closes his helmet.

                         WOODY
            You actually think you're THE "Buzz
            Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I
            thought it was an act!
                   (to the room)
            Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL
            Buzz Lightyear!

                         BUZZ
            You're mocking me, aren't you?

                         WOODY
            Oh, no, no, no...
                   (pointing behind Buzz)
            Buzz, look!  An alien!

                         BUZZ
            Where?

Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.

Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.

SFX: DOG BARKING

Woody stops short.  All the toys look to the bedroom window.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...

                         WOODY
            Uh-oh.

Slinky hides under the bed.

                         SLINKY
            It's Sid!

                         REX
            I thought he was at summer camp!

                         HAMM
            They must have kicked him out early
            this year.

The toys rush over to the window.

                         REX
            Oh, no!  Not Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            ...Incoming!

From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year-
old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumping
around in their backyard.

A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.
Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his
leash, barking wildly.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Who is it this time?

                         WOODY
            I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?

                         LENNY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody.

Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars,
approaching him from the other end of the desk.  Woody picks
Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.

                         REX
            Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one
            of these again!

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID'S BACKYARD

A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the
center of the backyard.  A huge M-80 is strapped to the
doll's back with masking tape.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (plays under the next
                   5 lines)
            Just stay where you are, Corporal!
            Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up.
            I know you're tired!  I know your
            leg is cramping, but you can't move.
            Do you hear me?

Buzz breaks through the crowd.

                         BUZZ
            What's going on?

                         WOODY
            Nothing that concerns you spacemen.
            Just us TOYS.

                         BUZZ
            I'd better take a look anyway.

Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.

                         BUZZ
            Why is that soldier strapped to an
            explosive device?

                         WOODY
                   (redirecting Buzz's view)
            That's why.  Sid.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF THE DOG, SCUD

                         BUZZ
            Sure is a hairy fellah.

                         WOODY
            No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!

Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID

He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.

                         WOODY
            THAT is Sid!

                         BUZZ
            You mean that happy child?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That ain't no happy child.

                         REX
            He tortures toys -- just for fun.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then we've got to do something!

Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.  The toys GASP IN SHOCK.

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing?!!  Get down
            from there!

                         BUZZ
            I'm going to go teach that boy a
            lesson.

                         WOODY
            Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt
            him with your scary laser.

Woody presses Buzz's laser button.  It emits a WIMPY
ELECTRONIC BEEP.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Be careful with that, it's
            extremely dangerous.

While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting
the fuse of the M80.

                         LENNY
            He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!

                         SID (O.S.)
            NO-O-O-O-O!!!  CA-A-A-A-A-ARL!

                         LENNY
            Hit the dirt!

The toys jump away from the window.

SFX: EXPLOSION

Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of
Andy's house.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!

Andy's toys peek over the window sill.

ANGLE: SID'S YARD

A large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat
Carl once stood.  Sid jumps up and down victoriously while
Scud resumes his BARKING.

                         BUZZ
            I could have stopped him.

                         WOODY
            Buzz, I would love to see you try.
                   (gesturing to Sid's yard)
            'Course I'd love to see you as a
            crater.

Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.

                         BO PEEP
            The sooner we move the better.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ANDY'S FRONT YARD - SUNSET

A "FOR SALE" real estate sign stands in the front yard.
Another sign reading "SOLD" hangs from the bottom.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL/ANDY'S BEDROOM

Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.  The room is
full of packing boxes, most of them half full.  Andy is
playing with Woody and Buzz.

                         ANDY
            To infinity and beyond!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, all this packing makes me
            hungry.  What would you say to
            dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

                         ANDY
            Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!

Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right
on top of Woody.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Go wash your hands and I'll get
            Molly ready.

The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves
Buzz off of him.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Can I bring some toys?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            You can bring ONE toy...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Just one?

Woody perks up with concern.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            One toy?

He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away
towards the opposite end of the desk.

Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.
With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Will Andy pick me?

He tips the 8 ball over.  The triangular oracle floats up to
the surface.  Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.

                         WOODY
            Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!

Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.  It rolls across
the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.

Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk
and peers down it.

ANGLE: BACK OF THE DESK

The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.  The space is
a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.

Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.

He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's
pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with.
Right behind Buzz sits

THE RC CAR

It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the
8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.

Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!
            Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
            We've got trouble!

                         BUZZ
            Trouble?!
                   (looking around)
            Where?!

                         WOODY
                   (pointing to the back
                   of the desk)
            Down there.  Just down there.  A
            helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,
            Buzz!

                         BUZZ
            Then we've no time to lose!!

Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.

                         BUZZ
            I don't see anything!

Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.
RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.

                         WOODY
            Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep
            looking.

Woody hits the "FORWARD" button on the remote and steers the
RC Car straight for Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            What kind of a toy -- ?

Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.  He dives out
of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...

A BULLETIN BOARD

The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.  Buzz
ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk
like arrows.

POTATO HEAD

sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.

He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board
slams down onto...

A GLOBE

knocking it out of its stand.  The globe starts rolling
right at Buzz.

Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.

Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind
him, Indiana Jones style.  Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on
a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the
way onto the window ledge.

The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style
desklamp.  The arm of the lamp swings all the way around,
barely missing Woody...

...and knocks Buzz out the window.

                         TOYS
            BUZZ!!!!

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!!

Woody looks out the window.  No sign of Buzz.  All the other
toys rush over to the sill.

                         SLINKY
            I don't see him in the driveway!  I
            think he bounced into Sid's yard.

Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed.

                         REX
                   (GASP)
            Buzz!

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!

Rex looks over at RC.  The remote control car is bouncing up
and down excitedly.

                         REX
            Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say
            something!

The toys turn from the window to RC.

                         REX
                   (leaning down close
                   to RC)
            What is it, boy?

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            He's sayin' that this was no accident.

                         TOYS
            Huh?

                         BO PEEP
            What do you mean?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...
                   (pointing at Woody)
            ...by Woody.

                         TOYS
            WHAT?!?

The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute.  You -- you don't
            think I meant to knock Buzz out the
            window, do you Potato Head?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you
            back-stabbin' murderer!

                         WOODY
            Now, it was an accident!  Guys,
            c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me

                         SLINKY
            We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?

                         REX
                   (backing away)
            Oh, I don't like confrontations.

The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.

                         SARGENT
            Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You
            are an absolute disgrace!  You
            don't deserve to --

Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.

Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on
            your playtime, could ya Woody?
            Didn't want to face the fact that
            Buzz just might be Andy's new
            favorite toy, so you got rid of him.
            Well, what if Andy starts playin'
            with me more, Woody, huh?  You
            gonna knock me outta the window, too?

Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the
desk -- trapped.

                         HAMM
            I don't think we should give him
            the chance.

Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.

                         SARGENT
            There he is, men!  Frag him!

The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all the
rest of the toys close in.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Let's string him up by his pull-
            string!

                         HAMM
            I got dibs on his hat!

                         BO PEEP
            Would you boys stop it?!

                         HAMM
            Tackle him!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can
            explain everything --

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy, c'mon!

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got
            to get Buzz.

                         SARGENT
            Retreat!

The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.

Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where
Woody is lying.  Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching
around the room.

                         ANDY
            Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            No, I haven't seen him.

Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            Psssst!

Woody looks across the room.

Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.
Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head
points an accusing finger in Woody's direction.

Woody GULPS.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy!  I'm heading out the door.

                         ANDY
            But Mom, I can't find him!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Well, honey, just grab some other
            toy!  Now c'mon!

                         ANDY
            Okay...

He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the
family van in the driveway.

                         ANDY
            I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I
            left him right there.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Honey, I'm sure he's around.
            You'll find him.

A BUSH

next to the van begins to rustle.  Hands part the foliage,
revealing Buzz.  He eyes Woody going into the van and does a
slow burn.

The van ENGINE STARTS UP.  Buzz races out of the bush, and
with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it
pulls out of the driveway.

ANGLE: SIDE OF ANDY'S HOUSE

A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable
distance above the ground.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window,
supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain."

                         SLINKY
            It's too short!  We need more monkeys!

                         REX
                   (holding up an empty barrel)
            There aren't any more!  That's the
            whole barrel.

Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.

                         REX
                   (yelling out window)
            Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working!
            We're formulating another plan!
            Stay calm!
                   (beat)
            Oh, where could he be?

EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps.

INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.

                         ANDY
            Can I help pump the gas?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly
sleeps up front in her car seat.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Yeah?!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Yeah -- when you're sixteen.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
                   (sarcastic)
            Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.

With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.  He
stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince
            those guys it was an accident?

Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!
            Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll
            find you here, he'll take us back
            to the room, and then you can tell
            everyone that this was all just a
            big mistake.  Huh?

No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare.

                         WOODY
                   (weakly)
            Right?  Buddy?

                         BUZZ
            I just want you to know that even
            though you tried to terminate me,
            revenge is not an idea we promote
            on my planet.

                         WOODY
            Oh.  Oh, that's good.

                         BUZZ
                   (getting in Woody's face)
            But we're not on my planet, are we?

                         WOODY
            No.

Buzz lunges for Woody.  The two toys fly off the seat and
out the open side door of the van.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked
in mortal combat.

                         WOODY
            Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of
            me?!

Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.

Woody lunges with all his might.  He smacks Buzz in the
face, making it SQUEAK with every blow.

Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.

                         WOODY
            Owwwww!!!

Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating
BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.

SFX: CAR DOOR SLAM

The toys stop fighting.  Before they can react...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Next stop...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!

The van drives off.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Andy?!

Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it
drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.

                         WOODY
            Doesn't he realize that I'm not
            there?
                   (beat)
            I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!

Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.  He flips open his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The
            local Sheriff and I seem to be at a
            huge refueling station of some
            sort --

Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to
seething anger.  He charges at Buzz.

                         WOODY
            You!

SFX: LOUD TRUCK HORN

Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a
behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.

Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where
he stands on the pavement.  The truck ROARS over him.

A GIGANTIC TIRE

stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.

Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back
under the truck until he bumps into Buzz.

                         BUZZ
                   (into wrist communicator)
            According to my nava-computer, the --

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

                         WOODY
            This is the perfect time to panic!
            I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're
            going to move from their house in
            two days and it's all your fault!!

                         BUZZ
            My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me
            out of the window in the first
            place --

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't
            shown up in your stupid little
            cardboard spaceship and taken away
            everything that was important to
            me --

                         BUZZ
            Don't talk to me about importance.
            Because of YOU the security of this
            entire universe is in jeopardy.

                         WOODY
                   (incredulous)
            WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!

Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the
stars.

                         BUZZ
            Right now, poised at the edge of
            the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been
            secretly building a weapon with the
            destructive capacity to annihilate
            an entire planet.  I alone have
            information that reveals this
            weapon's only weakness.
                   (pointing at Woody)
            And you, my friend, are responsible
            for delaying my rendez-vous with
            Star Command.

Woody explodes.

                         WOODY
            YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the
            real Buzz Lightyear, you're an
            action figure!!  You are a child's
            plaything!!!

Beat.

                         BUZZ
            You are a sad strange little man
            and you have my pity.  Farewell.

Buzz walks off.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya
            looney!

Woody walks away in the opposite direction.

                         WOODY

            Hey, Gas Dude!

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            You talkin' to me?

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Yeah, man, can you help me?  Do you
            know where Cutting Blvd. is?

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            Just a moment...

Woody looks in the direction of the bell.  His face lights
up at the sight of...

A PIZZA PLANET DELIVERY TRUCK.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pizza Planet...Andy!

Woody takes a step forward and then stops.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  I can't show my face in
            that room without Buzz.

Woody runs back under the tanker truck.  Buzz is at the far
end of the truck, walking away from Woody.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Buzz, come back!

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing to walk away)
            Go away.

Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and
then eyes...

ANGLE: DELIVERY TRUCK ROOF SIGN

Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo.

                         WOODY
            No, Buzz, you've gotta come back.
            I found a spaceship!

Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.

                         WOODY
            It's a spaceship, Buzz!

EXT. GAS STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the
            pizza's are getting cold here.

Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the
safety of a nearby oilcan display.

                         BUZZ
            Now you're sure this spacefreighter
            will return to its port of origin
            once it jettisons its food supply?

                         WOODY
            Uh-huh.  And when we get there,
            we'll be able to find a way to
            transport you...home.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then let's climb abroad.

Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the
pizza truck.  Woody chases after him.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's
            get in the back.  No one will see
            us there.

                         BUZZ
            Negative.  There are no restraining
            harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll
            be much safer in the cockpit.

In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear
view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a
            right, huh?

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            Yeah.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Okay, thanks for the directions.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

SFX: ENGINE STARTING

Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the
bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.

Woody lets out a YELL, as the back hatch slams back down on
his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.

INT. PIZZA PLANET DELIVERY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.

Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack of
pizzas in their insulated covers.  Buzz prudently fastens
his safety belt.

                         WOODY
            It'll be safer in the cockpit than
            the cargo bay.  What an idiot!

The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling
Woody to the back of the truck.

The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns
and hills at high speeds.  Woody is helplessly thrown around
the truck.  With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.

The truck climbs a steep hill.  Woody looks up just in time
to see...

A LARGE TOOL BOX

barreling towards him.

BAM!!!

                                            CUT TO:

A STAR-FILLED BLACK NIGHT SKY

We MOVE DOWN to reveal...

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - NIGHT

The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks.

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CAB - CONTINUOUS

After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the
passenger window.

ANGLE: THE FRONT ENTRANCE

Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.  As
CUSTOMERS approach the front, the guards part their crossed
"pizza spears," allowing the patrons to enter.

            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS blare out from speakers:

Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and
truck bed.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!

Woody is gone.  Just the toolbox and strewn trash.

                   (continued)
            Sheriff?

The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody.  He peels off
the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.

                         BUZZ
            There you are.  Now the entrance is
            heavily guarded.  We need a way to
            get inside.

Woody rises from the trash with a "MEGA-GULP" cup on his head.

                         BUZZ
            Great idea, Woody!  I like your
            thinking!

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE

In the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containers
littered around it.  MORE CUSTOMERS approach the "guarded"
entrance.

                         ROBOT GUARDS
            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass
through.  Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container
and "MEGA-GULP" cup stand up.

                         BUZZ
                   (in burger container)
            NOW!

The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.

                         BUZZ
                   (in container)
            Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is
            closing.

INT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze
immediately as a GROUP OF KIDS run past, forcing the toys to
pose as discarded trash.

Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking.
Buzz bumps into Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (using straw as periscope)
            Ow!  Watch where you're going!

                         BUZZ
                   (mouthing with burger box)
            Sorry.

They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw
off their disguises.  They then take a good look at...

THE ARCADE

The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children
playing video games.  A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lights
overwhelm the place.

Buzz is beaming with hope.

                         BUZZ
            What a space port.  Good work, Woody.

Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but
none of the kids look familiar to him.  Just then he HEARS...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Mom, can I play Black Hole?
            Please, please, please?!

Woody turns around and through the video games he spots...

ANDY

standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Andy!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            What's Black Hole?

                         ANDY
            Oh, it's so cool...

The family begins to walk away.

                         BUZZ
            Now we need to find a ship that's
            headed for Sector 12 --

Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when
Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way!
            There's a special ship.  I just saw
            it!

                         BUZZ
            You mean it has hyperdrive?

                         WOODY
            Hyper-active hyperdrive, and
            astro...uh, turf.

The toys manage to get ahead of Andy.  Woody peeks around
the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and
Andy to approach.

                         WOODY
                   (tracking Andy and family)
            C'mon, c'mon, that's it...

                         BUZZ
            Where is it?  I don't see the --

Buzz stops short at the sight of...

A CRANE GAME

It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Spaceship.

                         WOODY
            Alright Buzz, get ready...

Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice,
his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.

                         WOODY
            Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're
            gonna jump in the basket --

Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone.  He looks across the
way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game
through the "PRIZE" slot.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.

It has already gone past.

                         WOODY
            Dooh!  No!  This cannot be
            happening to me!!

Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold
back for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.

INT. CRANE GAME

Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot
from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of...

SQUEEZE TOY ALIENS

There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute.

                         ALIEN #1
                   (excited)
            A stranger!

                         ALIEN #2
            From the outside!

                         ALIENS
            Oo-o-o-o-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            Greetings!  I am Buzz Lightyear!  I
            come in peace!

                         ALIENS
            Tell us!  What is it like outside?

The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children.

EXT. CRANE GAME

With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane
game and dives through the prize slot.

INT. CRANE GAME - CONTINUOUS

Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            This is an intergalactic emergency!
            I need to commandeer your vessel to
            Sector 12!

Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by
the cute alien toys.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued; to the aliens)
            Who's in charge here?

All the aliens point upward.

                         ALIENS
            The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!

Woody and Buzz look up.

ANGLE: CRANE GAME CLAW

It dangles directly above the toys.

                         ALIEN #1
            The claw is our master.

                         ALIEN #2
            The claw chooses who will go and
            who will stay.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            This is ludicrous.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (laughter)

Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.  He turns to
see Sid heading straight for the crane game.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  Sid!!!

Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the
two of them deep into the pile of aliens.

                         WOODY
            Get down!!

Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his
pants pocket.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I
            was --

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            YOU are the one that decided to
            climb into this --

                         ALIEN #4
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h-h.  The claw.  It moves.

ANGLE: CLAW

It moves into position and hovers directly above the area
where Woody and Buzz are hiding.

The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is
right on top of Buzz.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (whispering excitedly)
            I have been chosen!!

Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by
the claw.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (continued)
            Farewell, my friends!  I go on to a
            better place.

                         SID
            Gotcha!

With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,
forcing the space ranger to freeze.  Sid suddenly spots Buzz.

                         SID
            A Buzz Lightyear!  No way!

Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way
to escape.  Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes...

A SMALL REPAIR DOOR

Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.
He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few
attempts, is able to pry the door open.

The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and
grabs his head.

                         SID
            Yes!

The claw begins to lift Buzz up.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Buzz, NO!

Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.

Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.

Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of
aliens, out of Sid's view.

                         SID
                   (slamming his fist
                   against the glass)
            Wha -- ?  Hey!!

Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the
door with Buzz.  Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the
pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.

                         ALIEN #4
            He has been chosen.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What are you doing?

                         ALIEN #5
            He must go.

                         WOODY
            Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you
            zealots!

                         ALIENS
            He must go!  Do not fight the claw!
            Do not anger the claw!  He has been
            chosen.

Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the
air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid.

                         SID
            Alright!  Double prizes!

Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and
snatched up by Sid.

                         SID
                   (looking at his two
                   new toys)
            Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.

ANGLE: CLOSEUP OF SKULL ON SID'S T-SHIRT

                                          MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.  He
is HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying his
backpack in his hand.

Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path
towards the front door.

Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to
see Sid's house.  He recognizes Andy's house next door.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the
backpack.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling
            from here!  You're almost home.

                         ALIEN
            Nirvana is coming!  The mystic
            portal awaits!

                         WOODY
                   (to Alien)
            Will you be quiet?!!
                   (to both)
            You guys don't get it, do you?
            Once we go into Sid's house, we
            won't be coming out.

ANGLE: TOYS' POV FROM OUT BACKPACK

The front door opens to reveal Scud.  The dog lunges
straight for the backpack, BARKING.

                         SID
            Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good
            boy!

The dog begrudgingly obeys.

                         SID
            Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.

Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            FREEZE!!!

The toys go still.  Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the
backpack.  The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's
snout.

                         SID
            Ready, set, NOW.

In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in
his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.

Buzz and Woody react in horror.

                         SID
            Hannah!  Hey, Hannah!!!

Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail little
sister, carrying her Janie Doll.

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Did I get my package in the mail?

                         HANNAH
            I dunno.

                         SID
            Whaddaya mean, you don't know?

                         HANNAH
                   (insistent)
            I don't know!

                         SID
                   (mock concern)
            Oh no, Hannah!

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Look!  Janie!

He grabs the doll.

                         HANNAH
            Hey!!

                         SID
            She's sick!

                         HANNAH
                   (panic rising)
            No she's NOT --

                         SID
            I'll have to perform one of
            my...operations!

                         HANNAH
            NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!

Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit.

                         WOODY
            Not Sid's room...not there...

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

Sid races to his bedroom door.  Hannah is right behind.

                         HANNAH
            Sid!  Give her back!

Sid just LAUGHS.  He charges into the room and slams the
door in his sister's face.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
                   (pounding on his door)
            Sid!  Sid!...

Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over
to a makeshift workbench.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Oh, no.  We have a sick patient
            here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!

Sid CLICKS on a bare bulb dangling above his "operating
table."

Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as
Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Sid, give her back!  Give her back
            now!  I'm telling!

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Patient is...
                   (straining while
                   tightening vise)
            ...pre-e-epped.

Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it
like a surgeon's mask.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            No one's ever attempted a double
            bypass brain transplant before.

Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Now for the tricky part -- pliers!

                         BUZZ
                   (whispering to Woody)
            I don't believe that man's ever
            been to medical school.

Sid struggles for a moment with his "patient" then stops.

                         SID
                   (as Nurse)
            Doctor, you've done it!
                   (running to the door)
            Hannah?

He opens the door.  Hannah is standing there, looking worried.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Janie's all better now.

He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a
pterodactyl's.  Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of the
monstrosity and bolts down the hallway.

                         HANNAH
            MOM!!  MOM!!

                         SID
            She's lying!  Whatever she says
            it's not true!

Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah,
slamming the door behind him.

Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new
surroundings.  Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains
and power tools adorn the messy room.

They are in Hell...toy Hell.

                         WOODY
            We are gonna die.
                   (bolting out of the pack)
            I'm outta here!

Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to
open it.  No good.  Woody drops to the floor.

                         WOODY
            Locked!  There's gotta be another
            way out of here.

SFX: ROLLING SOUND

Woody is startled by the noise.

A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its
side.

Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes
it like a weapon.

Just then a shadow passes by Woody.  He turns quickly but
sees nothing.

                         WOODY
            Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?

Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.

He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.  Woody turns on the
flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the
noise, illuminating...

A BABY DOLL HEAD'S PROFILE

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!
            Come out here.  Do you know a way
            out of here?

The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one-
eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set
pieces.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP!!)

The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.
Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on
BABYFACE.

Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows:
a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with
a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack-
in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others).

Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            B-B-B-Buzz!

Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as
they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them
off into the shadows.

                         BUZZ
            They're cannibals!

Woody retreats back into the backpack.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters.  He punches a
button on his chest.

                         BUZZ
            May day!  May day!  Come in, Star
            Command!  Send reinforcements!...
                   (pause)
            Star Command, do you copy?

No response.

Buzz adjusts his laser light.  It emits a short BLIP.

                         BUZZ
                   (aiming his arm out
                   the pack)
            I've set my laser from stun to kill.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if
            anyone attacks us we can blink 'em
            to death.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while
Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on.

Some bushes rustle below.

                         REX
            Hey, you guys!  I think I've found
            him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!

Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.  The
annoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.

                         REX
            Whiskers!  Will you get out of
            here?!  You're interfering with the
            search and rescue.

SFX: APPROACHING CAR

Rex turns off the flashlight.

                         REX
                   (whispering)
            Look!  They're home!

The toys duck behind the sill.

The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway.  Andy and Mrs.
Davis get out.

                         ANDY
            Mom, have you seen Woody?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Where was the last place you left him?

                         ANDY
                   (searching the van)
            Right here in the van.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're
            just not looking hard enough.

                         ANDY
            He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.

The toys all look at one another.

                         BO PEEP
                   (GASP)
            Woody's gone?!

                         HAMM
            Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran
            away.

Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window.
                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was
            guilty.

                         REX
            Who would've thought he was capable
            of such atrocities?!

Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly
crestfallen.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW - DAY

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (as Interrogator)
            Oh, a survivor.  Where is the rebel
            base?  Talk!

SFX: HAND SLAP

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on
the floor.

Sid crosses to the window.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            I can see your will is strong.

Sid opens the window shade.  Bright sunlight shines down
onto Woody.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Well, we have ways of making you talk.

Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
focuses the beam on Woody's forehead.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            Where are your rebel friends now?
            Heh, heh.

A bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins
to smolder.

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!

Sid pulls the magnifying glass away.

                         SID
            Alright!!

Sid runs out of the room.  As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps
up SCREAMING, his forehead burning.

He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the
floor, and dunks his head in.

Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup
darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl.
Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like
glasses.

                         BUZZ
            Are you alright?
                   (whacking him on the back)
            I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A
            lesser man would have talked under
            such torture.

Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal
spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.

                         WOODY
            I sure hope this isn't permanent.

                         BUZZ
                   (checking his wrist communicator)
            Still no word from Star Command.
            We're not that far from the
            spaceport --

Woody's eyes light up.

ANGLE: SPOON

Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.  It's open.

                         WOODY
            The door!  It's open!  We're free!!

Woody runs for the door.  Buzz follows.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, we don't know what's out there!

                         WOODY
            I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

THE MUTANT TOYS

suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.  Woody
hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do
            something!  Quick!

                         BUZZ
            Shield your eyes!

Buzz fires his laser at them.  The little red beam just
flickers against Babyface's head.  The mutant toys look
confusedly at each other.

                         BUZZ
            It's not working.  I recharged it
            before I left.  It should be good
            for hours --

                         WOODY
            Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use
            your karate chop action!

Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant
toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's
arm involuntarily "chop" up and down.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutants)
            Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!

                         BUZZ
            Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that?
            Stop that!

                         WOODY
            Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!

Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,
continually chopping Buzz's arm.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, stop it!!

                         WOODY
            Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!

Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody races down the corridor...

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home...

...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,
and is confronted by...

SCUD

asleep on the landing.

Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.  He
slowly backs up the stairs.

Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the
hallway wall.  He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.

                         WOODY
                   (muffled gasp)


                         BUZZ
                   (whisper)
            Another stunt like that, cowboy --
            you're going to get us killed.

                         WOODY
                   (pulling Buzz's hand away)
            Don't tell me what to do!

                         BUZZ
            Shhh!

Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts
across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.
Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow.

Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and
meets up with Buzz.

As he stands...

WOODY'S PULLSTRING RING

gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.

The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that
Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther
until --

It SNAPS off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAA!!

Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's
voice box.

ANGLE: SCUD'S EYE

It opens.

Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            Giddy-up partner!...

GROWLING, Scud starts up the stairs.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...We got to get this wagon train a
            movin'!

Woody and Buzz take off running.

                         BUZZ
            Split up!

Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway.  Buzz
dives behind one while Woody jumps into...

A CLOSET

Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of
the landing.  CRASHED can be heard from behind the closet
door, getting Scud's attention.

Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND
GROWLING at the closet.

Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to
enter Buzz's doorway.

SFX: SNORING

The noise stops the dog in his tracks.  Both Scud and Buzz
look up to see...

INT. SID'S DAD'S DEN - CONTINUOUS

MR. PHILLIPS is asleep on a La-Z-Boy recliner in front of
the T.V.

Scud backs out and heads down the stairs.

Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...

                         SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV)
            Calling Buzz Lightyear!!  Come in
            Buzz Lightyear!!  This is Star
            Command.  Buzz Lightyear!  Do you
            read me?!

                         BUZZ
            Star Command!

Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to
speak into it when he is interrupted.

                         KID #1 (O.S.)
            Buzz Lightyear responding!  Read
            you loud and clear!

Buzz turns around to see...

A TELEVISION SET

Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of
stars.  The image quickly changes to two young boys playing
in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll.

                         SPACE COMMANDER
            Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs
            your help!

                         KID #1
                   (into toy wrist communicator)
            On the way!

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching.  He walks
slowly towards the television set.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            The world's greatest superhero!
            Now the world's greatest TOY!

The Buzz Lightyear doll is now out of the box and being
displayed.

                         KID #2
            Wow!

With every feature demonstrated on the TV, Buzz compares the
same feature on himself.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Pulsating laserlight!

                         KID #2

            space!

Buzz presses the same button on his uniform.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

                         TV BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

On the TV screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears
to be launched through the air.  The words:  NOT A FLYING
TOY flash across the bottom of the screen.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   (non-excited lawyer voice)
            Not a flying toy.

Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Get your Buzz Lightyear action
            figure and save a galaxy near you!

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of
Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.

                         LOCAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Available at all Al's Toy Barn
            outlets in the tri-county area.

Buzz is stricken.  He looks down at his wrist communicator
and opens it.

ANGLE: WRIST COMMUNICATOR

Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: "MADE
IN TAIWAN."

SONG: "I WILL GO SAILING NO MORE" BEGINS

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.

As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up
through the railing at...

A SMALL WINDOW

It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.  A bird flies past.

The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head.

                         WOODY (V.O.)
            You are a toy!  You can't fly!

Buzz bows his head, defeated.

BEAT

Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.  He
slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny
its message of "Made in Taiwan."

Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.  He pops open
his wings, and aims himself towards the window above.

                         BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

Buzz leaps off the banister...

and falls.

In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull
farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz CRASHES on the entryway floor.

Buzz opens his eyes to see...

HIS SEVERED LEFT ARM

The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm
socket.

Buzz drops his head back in defeat.

SONG ENDS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            M-o-o-om?  Mom, have you seen my
            Sally doll?

Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps
on him.

                         MOM (O.S.)
            What, dear?  What was that?

Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles.

                         HANNAH
            Nevermind.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

ANGLE: CLOSET

The knob jiggles for a moment.  Suddenly, the door flies
open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights,
standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height.

Woody and the rest of the junk topple over.

A bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head.

                         WOODY
            Oo-o-of!
                   (to the hallway)
            Buzz?!  The coast is clear.  Buzz?
            Where are you?
                         BUZZ (O.S.; SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!  Let's go!!

Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights
with him.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Really?  That is so-o-o interesting.

Woody peeks into the open doorway of...

INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hannah is pretending to have a tea party.  Her guests are
dolls, headless dolls, that is except for...

BUZZ

He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly
apron and fashionable party hat.

                         HANNAH
                   (continued)
            Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?

                         WOODY
                   (under his breath)
            Buzz!

Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and
pours imaginary tea with it.

                         HANNAH
            It's so nice you could join us on
            such late notice.

Woody steps back into the hallway.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!

                         HANNAH
            What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit.  It
            goes quite well with your head.

Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further
down the hall.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                         WOODY
                   (high voice)
            Hannah!  Oh, Hannah!

Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.

                         HANNAH
                   (yelling out her room)
            Mom?
                   (to the dolls)
            Please excuse me, ladies.  I'll be
            right back.

As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down
onto the table.

Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and
walks downstairs.

                         HANNAH
            What is it, Mom?  Mom, where are you?

Woody bolts into Hannah's room.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Hey, Buzz!  Are you okay?

Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.

                         BUZZ
            Gone!  It's all go-o-one!  All of
            it's gone.  Bye-bye!  Whoo-hoo!
            See ya!

Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.

                         WOODY
            What happened to you?

                         BUZZ
            One minute you're defending the
            whole galaxy...
                   (pointing at other dolls)
            ...and suddenly you find yourself
            suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie
            Antoinette and her little sisters.

The headless dolls turn and wave.

Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on
the table.

                         WOODY
            I think you've had enough tea for
            today.
                   (helping Buzz up)
            Let's get you out of here, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
                   (grabbing Woody)
            Don't you get it?!  You see the hat?
            I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
                   (hysterical laughter)


                         WOODY
            Snap out of it, Buzz!

Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face
with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.

Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.
Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.

                         BUZZ
                   (sober)
            I'm sorry.  You're right.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            ...I'm just a little depressed,
            that's all.  I can get through this.

Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.

                         BUZZ
            Oh, I'm a sham!!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            Look at me!  I can't even fly out
            of a window!

Woody stops short.  He looks down the hallway in the
direction of Sid's room.

ANGLE: SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to
Andy's bedroom window.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            But -- the hat looked good.  Tell
            me the hat looked good!  The apron
            is a bit much, it's not my color...

                         WOODY
            Out the window...Buzz, you're a
            genius!

Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz
towards Sid's room.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            Come on, this way!

                         BUZZ
            Years of Academy training...wasted!!

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship.  Hamm's
wearing Potato Head's hat.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            B-3.

                         HAMM
            Miss.  G-6.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ohhh!  You sunk it!

                         HAMM
            Heh-heh.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Are you peeking?

                         HAMM
            Oh, quit your whining and pay up.

Potato Head reaches for his ear.

                         HAMM
            No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the
            nose.  C'mon!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pulling out his
                   nose; nasally)
            How 'bout three out of five?

He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...

                         WOODY (O.S.)
            Hey guys!  Guys!  Hey!

Both toys look across the way.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves to
the toys.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Son of a building block, it's Woody!

                         HAMM
            He's in the psycho's bedroom!

                         WOODY
            Hi!

                         HAMM
                   (into Andy's bedroom)
            Everyone, it's Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window.

                         BO PEEP
            Woody?!

                         REX
            You're kidding?

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!

INT. SID'S ROOM

                         WOODY
            We're gonna get outta here, Buzz --
            Buzz?

Buzz is not there.  Woody looks down at the floor.

Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing "bombs away" with his
broken arm.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW/SID'S WINDOW

The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody.

                         REX
            Hey, look!

                         BO PEEP
            Woody!

                         WOODY
            Boy, am I glad to see you guys!

                         SLINKY
            I knew you'd come back, Woody!

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing over there?

                         WOODY
            It's a long story, Bo.  I'll
            explain later.  Here, catch this!

Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over.  Slinky
catches them.

                         SLINKY
            I got it, Woody!

                         REX
                   (overly excited)
            He got it, Woody!

                         WOODY
            Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just
            tie it on to something!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea!
            How about we DON'T?!

Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Hey?!!

                         BO PEEP
            Potato Head!?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Did you all take stupid pills this
            morning?!  Have you forgotten what
            he did to Buzz?  And now you want
            to let him back over here?

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  You got it all wrong,
            Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz
            is right here.  He's with me!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You are a liar!

                         WOODY
            No, I'm not!
                   (to Buzz)
            Buzz, come over here and you just
            tell the nice toys that you're not
            dead.

ANGLE: BUZZ

He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker
on his wrist communicator.  He crumples it up and tosses it
aside.

                         WOODY
                   (to Andy's toys)
            Just a sec.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Will you get up here and
            give me a hand?!

Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by
Woody's feet.

                         WOODY
                   (insincerely)
            Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.
                   (exploding)
            This is serious!!

                         REX (O.S.)
            Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            He's lyin'.  Buzz ain't there.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S WINDOW

Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window.  He pretends to
notice something out of the other toy's view.

                         WOODY
                   (forced casualness)
            Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say
            "hello" to the guys over there?

BUZZ'S SEVERED ARM

suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of
sight.  Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz.

                         WOODY (AS BUZZ)
            Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and
            beyond!

                         REX
            Hey look!  It's Buzz!

                         WOODY
                   (shaking the arm's hand)
            Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the
            guys our new secret best-friends
            hand shake.  Gimme five, man!

                         HAMM
            Something's screwy here.

                         WOODY
            So, you see?  We're friends now,
            guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?
                   (as BUZZ)
            You bet.  Gimme a hug.

Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; as himself)
            Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.

                         SLINKY
            See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back
            the lights, Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait just a minute.  What are you
            trying to pull?!

                         WOODY
            Nothing.

Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up...

...exposing the severed arm.

The toys all SCREAM in horror.  Rex clasps his hands to his
mouth and turns away to BARF.

Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's
too late.

                         HAMM
            Oh, that is disgusting.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Murderer!

                         WOODY
            No!  No, no, no, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You murdering dog!

                         WOODY
            No, it's not what you think, I swear!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid
            pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!

Potato Head drops the lights.

                         WOODY
            No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave!
            You've gotta help us, please!  You
            don't know what it's like over here!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (to the other toys)
            Come on.  Let's get out of here.

                         HAMM
            Go back to your lives, citizens.
            Show's over.

All the toys leave the window except Slinky.

                         WOODY
            Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please!
            Please!  Listen to me!

Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!

SFX: THUNDER

As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the
window sill in defeat.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

BROKEN TOY SOUNDS emit from behind Woody.  He turns from the
window to see...

THE MUTANT TOYS

converging all around Buzz.

                         WOODY
            BUZZ!!

Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the
desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.

                         WOODY
            Go away, you disgusting freaks!

Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his
erector-set pinchers.

Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.

Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.

                         WOODY
            Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!

Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,
crashing into the wall.

By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of
mutant toys.

Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.

                         WOODY
            He is still alive, and you're not
            gonna get him, you monsters!

He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way
to...

BUZZ

He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.

Woody's anger turns to confusion.

                         WOODY
            Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!

Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real
when he looks to the mutants.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            But -- but they're cannibals.  We
            saw them eat those other toys.

The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's
last "operation": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.  Their
heads have been taped back on the correct bodies.

The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you
            were gonna...
                   (laughs nervously)
            ...you know, eat my friend.

Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark
corners of the room.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's
            wrong?

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!

                         WOODY
            Sid!!!

FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.  Woody tries to pick up the
still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz,
            you're...
                   (GRUNT)
            ...get up...

Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their
progress is too slow.  He shakes Buzz hard.

                         WOODY
            Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But
            don't blame me.

Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor
and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...

Sid enters carrying a big box.

                         SID
            It came!  It finally came!

Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.

                         SID
                   (reverently)
            The big one.

He pulls out a rocket with "THE BIG ONE" written on it.

                         SID
                   (reading the rocket label)
            "Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of
            reach of children."  COOL...
                   (looks around)
            What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey,
            where's that wimpy cowboy doll?

Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.

No Woody.

ANGLE: UNDERSIDE OF MILKCRATE

Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging
on for dear life.

SFX: BUZZ'S LASER

Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating
his laser.

                         SID
            Yes!  I've always wanted to put a
            spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.

He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws
a toolbox on top of the crate.

The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding
place.  Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of
the crate "jail."

Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of
electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENT
CHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket.

SFX: THUNDERCLAP

A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.

                         SID
            Oh, no...

Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.
Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.

                         SID
            Aw, man...!

Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.

Suddenly Sid's face brightens.  He turns his focus from the
rain to the Buzzrocket.

                         SID
                   (as Newscaster)
            Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of
            the shuttle has been delayed due to

            launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...

Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and
places it next to Buzz.

                         SID
            Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  She hands him
his cowboy hat.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            I looked everywhere, honey, but all
            I could find was your hat.

                         ANDY
                   (groggy)
            But what if we leave them behind?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure
            we'll find Woody and Buzz before we
            leave tomorrow.

Andy's eyes shut.  Mom turns out the light and quietly exits
the room.

A moving box on the floor, with the words "Andy's Toys!"
scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.

                         REX (O.S.)
                   (muffled)
            Aaaah!  I need air!

Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packing
styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  Potato Head appears
beside him.

                         REX
                   (relieved)
            Aa-a-a-a-ah!
                   (COUGH)

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Will you quit moving around?!

                         REX
            I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so
            nervous before I travel.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            How did I get stuck with YOU as a
            moving buddy?

Potato Head drops back down into the box.

                         REX
                   (following Potato Head)
            Everyone else was picked.

BO PEEP

peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at
Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Woody, if only you could see
            how much Andy misses you.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling.

INT. SID'S ROOM

Sid is in bed fast asleep.

Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the
weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.

Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly
with the rocket strapped to his back.

                         WOODY
            Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!

No reaction from Buzz.

Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it
at Buzz, striking his helmet.

Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Get over here and see if you
            can get this tool box off me.

Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I
            can't do this without you.  I need
            your help.

                         BUZZ
            I can't help.  I can't help anyone.

                         WOODY
            Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can
            get me out of here and then I'll
            get that rocket off you, and we'll
            make a break for Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's
            the difference.

                         WOODY
            Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
            You must not be thinking clearly.

                         BUZZ
            No, Woody, for the first time I am
            thinking clearly.
                   (looking at himself)
            You were right all along.  I'm not
            a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A
            stupid little insignificant toy.

                         WOODY
            Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being
            a toy is a lot better than being a
            Space Ranger.

                         BUZZ
            Yeah, right.

                         WOODY
            No, it is.  Look, over in that
            house is a kid who thinks you are
            the greatest, and it's not because
            you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's
            because you're a TOY!  You are HIS
            toy.

                         BUZZ
            But why would Andy want me?

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy want you?!  Look at
            you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any
            other toy would give up his moving
            parts just to be you.  You've got
            wings, you glow in the dark, you
            talk, your helmet does that -- that
            whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.

Woody pauses and looks at himself.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; depressed)
            As a matter of fact you're too cool.
            I mean -- I mean what chance does a
            toy like me have against a Buzz
            Lightyear action figure?  All I can
            do is...

Woody pulls his own pull-string.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            There's a snake in my boots!

Woody bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy ever want to play
            with me, when he's got you?
                   (pause)
            I'm the one that should be strapped
            to that rocket.

Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.

Buzz lifts up his foot.

ANGLE: THE SOLE OF BUZZ'S FOOT

The signature "ANDY" reads through the dirt and scuff marks.

Buzz gazes back at Woody.  A look of determination spreads
across his face.

                         WOODY
            Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You
            should get out of here while you can.

Silence.

Woody turns around.

Buzz is gone.

Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.  Woody looks
up to see...

BUZZ

He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I
            thought you were --

                         BUZZ
            Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid
            over in that house who needs us.
            Now let's get you out of this thing.

                         WOODY
            Yes Sir!

Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they
finally get it to move but it's slow progress.

                         WOODY
                   (strained)
            Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!

SFX: TRUCK

The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench.

ANGLE: OUT SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise...

A MOVING TRUCK

can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  It's the moving van.

                         WOODY
            We've got to get out of here...NOW.

Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.

Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.  The toolbox
begins to move.

Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool
chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the
desk.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, Buzz.

Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.
Woody drops down to the floor below.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!

Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox
(and milkcrate) farther out.

                         BUZZ
            ...almost
                   (GRUNT)
            ...there
                   (GRUNT)
            ...

Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and
milkcrate topple towards him.

                         WOODY
                   (nervous laugh)

The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.

Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who
stirs...

                         SID
                   (in his sleep)
            I wanna ride the pony...

Sid does not wake.  Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peers
over the edge of the workbench.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!

Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.

                         WOODY
                   (punch-drunk)
            No, I'm fine...I'm okay...

SFX: ALARM CLOCK

It goes off by Sid's bed.  Woody drops back under the
toolbox and Buzz goes limp.

Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up.

                         SID
            Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!

Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room.

                         SID (O.S.)
            TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!

Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches
the door just before it closes.  As he swings the door back
open Woody is confronted by...

SCUD

The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.

                         WOODY
            Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!

Woody slams the door shut just in time.  Scud BARKS AND
SCRATCHES at the door.

                         WOODY
                   (out of breath; to himself)
            Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,
            think!

Woody looks across the room.

THE MUTANT TOYS

have appeared all around the room.

                         WOODY
            Guys!

The mutant toys all scatter and hide.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!
            Please!  There's a good toy down
            there and he's -- he's going to be
            blown to bits in a few minutes all
            because of me.  I've gotta save him!
                   (pause)
            -- But I need your help.

No response.

Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the
shadows from under the bed.

                         WOODY
            Please.  He's my friend.  He's the
            only one I've got.

Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's
metal bedpost.

The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around
Woody.  He kneels down into a huddle with them.

                         WOODY
                   (to Babyface)
            Thank you.
                   (to the others)
            Okay.  I think I know what to do.
            We're going to have to break a few
            rules, but if it works, it'll help
            everybody.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

THE MOVERS cart out the last load.  A forlorn Andy clutches
onto Buzz's "spaceship" box in one hand and his cowboy hat
in the other.

Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH.

EXT. BACKYARD SHED

Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under
his arm.

                         SID
                   (as Astronaut)
            Houston to Mission Control.  Come
            in, Control.

He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Launch pad is being constructed!
            Heh-heh.

SID'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised to
attack anything that exits.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out
of dominoes and Scrabble tiles.  He points to it with a
pencil as he addresses the mutants.

                         WOODY
            All right, listen up.  I need Pump
            Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?

LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps
forward from the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; to Legs)
            You're with Ducky.
                   (to the others)
            RollerBob and I don't move till we
            get the signal.  Clear?

The mutants all give an affirmative nod.

                         WOODY
            Okay, let's move!

The toys all break.

Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll
torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and
pull the face plate off the wall.  They disappear into the
heating duct.

INT. HEATING DUCT - CONTINUOUS

Ducky and Legs come to an intersection.  Ducky QUACKS and
they head down the right tunnel.

INT. SID'S ROOM

HAND-IN-THE-BOX, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box,
stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob
of the bedroom door.

Woody hops onto ROLLERBOB, a skateboard with a soldier's
upper torso tied to its front.

                         WOODY
            Wind the frog!

WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins winding
up THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheels
instead of legs.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/PORCH ATTIC

A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky
and Legs.  They make their way towards a junction box
sitting in the center of the floor.

Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

THE BROKEN PORCH LIGHT

suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof.

Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that the
coast is clear.

INT. SID'S ROOM

All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently,
their eyes fixed on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Wait for the signal.

INT. PORCH ATTIC

Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel,
hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the
open hole.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing.
Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination:
the doorbell.

Ducky presses it.

SFX: DOORBELL

INT. SID'S ROOM

Woody throws his arm down.

                         WOODY
            Go!!

Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.

The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.
Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.

SFX: DOORBELL

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            I'll get it!

Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard.

                         WOODY
            Alright, let's go.

Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and
crew out into the hallway.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY

SFX: DOORBELL

Hannah walks to the front door...

                         HANNAH
            I'm coming!  I'm coming!

...and opens it.

EXT./INT. FRONT DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

Nobody's there.

Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by his
plunger.

THE FROG

zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind.  The
Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs
and out the open front door.

Hannah looks back inside at Scud.  In that moment, Ducky
catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the
roof.

Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and
runs out onto the empty porch.

                         HANNAH
                   (annoyed)
            SCUD!!!

Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can
get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut.

                         HANNAH
            Stupid dog.

Scud smashes into the closed door and begins BARKING furiously.

As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice
Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the
corner, heading straight into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

By now RollerBob has really picked up speed.  He shoots
underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair
legs, straight towards...

THE PET DOOR

                         WOODY
            Lean back!

The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a
wheelie.  They smash through the doggie door...

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

...and catapult into the bushes.

The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the
launchpad.  Sid is still in the toolshed.

                         SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT)
            Uh, Mission Control...is the
            launchpad construction complete? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to
            guide wire.  We are currently
            obtaining the...ignition sticks.
            Countdown will commence momentarily.
            Stand by --
                   (simulated static)


Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a
drain pipe.  They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (to toys in the bush)
            Let's go!

The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches?
            Oh, oh, wait, here they are.
            Nevermind...

Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of
            this thing!

Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Shhhhhhh!

                         BUZZ
            What?!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            It's ok.  Everything's under control.

Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?!

Sid emerges from the tool shed.  Buzz freezes.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, all systems are go.
            Requesting permission to launch --
                   (spotting Woody)
            Hey!  How'd you get out here?

Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.

                         SID
            Oh, well, you and I can have a
            cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...

He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses
him onto the grill of an open barbecue.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, do we have permission to
            launch? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You
            are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...

During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their
final positions.

Sid lights a match.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            ...and counting.  Ten!  Nine!
            Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four!
            Three!  Two!... One!...

Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky!!

                         SID
            Huh?

Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.  He turns to look at
Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for
the sound emitting from his voice box.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            This town ain't big enough for the
            two of us!

                         SID
            What?!

Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the water hole...

                         SID
            It's busted.

He raises Woody up, about to throw him away --

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!

Sid stops short and looks at Woody again.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            That's right.  I'm talking to YOU,
            Sid Phillips.  We don't like being
            blown up, Sid, or smashed, or
            ripped apart...

While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring.

It isn't moving.  Sid GULPS.

                         SID
            W-w-w-we?

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            That's right.
                   (beat)
            Your toys.

The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom
mutants, begin rising from the ground in "NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD" fashion.
The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid.  Sid is
too frightened to scream or move.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            From now on, you must take good
            care of your toys.  Because if you
            don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We
            toys can see...

Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...everything.

For a split second Woody's face comes to life.

                         WOODY
                   (regular voice)
            So play nice.

Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house.

                         SID
            AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!

Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.

INT. SID'S ENTRYWAY

Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sid
rushes up to her.

                         SID
            The toys!  The toys are alive!

Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            N-N-Nice dolly...

Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in
Sid's face.  He SCREAMS and runs upstairs.  Hannah chases
after him, taunting.

                         HAMM
            What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want
            to play with Sally?!

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD

The toys are all congratulating one another.
                         WOODY
            Nice work, fellahs.  Good job.
            Comin' out of the ground -- what a
            touch!  That was a stroke of genius.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!

Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to
Sid's launchpad.  Buzz extends his hand to Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Thanks.

They shake.

                   (depressed)
            Bye, house.

Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house.

ANGLE: ANDY'S DRIVEWAY - THE FAMILY VAN

Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting
into the van.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  The van!

Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutant toys)
            We gotta run!  Thanks, guys.

With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint
towards the fence.

SFX: VAN ENGINE STARTING

                         WOODY
            Quick!

Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but
Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.

EXT. ANDY'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before
realizing that Buzz is missing.  He looks back to discover
Buzz stuck in the fence.

                         BUZZ
            Just go!  I'll catch up!

Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.

The van begins pulling out of the driveway.

Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the
fence.

The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the
van driving off down the street.

SFX: TRUCK ENGINE

Woody and Buzz turn around.

THE MOVING VAN

drives right over them.  Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking just
in time.

After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few
steps behind.

                         BUZZ
            Come on!

ANGLE: SID'S FRONT PORCH

Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the
sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the
moving truck.

Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few
paces.

A STRAP

dangles off the back of the truck.  Buzz makes a leap for it
and grabs hold.  He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.

Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.

                         BUZZ
            You can do it, Woody.

Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.

                         WOODY
            Whew, I made it!

Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.
Woody looks behind him to see...

SCUD

The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.

                         WOODY
                   (kicking Scud with
                   other foot)
            Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid
            dog!  Down!  Down!

Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.

                         BUZZ
            Hold on, Woody!

                         WOODY
            I can't do it!  Take care of Andy
            for me!

                         BUZZ
            NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!

Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.  He grabs
Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  Scud YELPS, letting go
of Woody.  The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his
face.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and
Scud behind.

Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the
bumper.  He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to
lift up the heavy door.

Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at
a traffic light.

Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking
Woody with it.

Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck
until he spots what he's looking for.

A PILE OF MOVING BOXES

with the words "ANDY'S TOYS" written on them in crayon.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Scud flings Buzz off his face.  Buzz goes tumbling under a
parked car.  Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to
get under it.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes.

ANGLE: INSIDE OF BOX

All the toys wince and MOAN as they cover their eyes from
the sudden brightness.

                         TOYS
            What?!

                         REX
            Are we there already?

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!  How'd you --

Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin
rummaging through the next box.

Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE IN
CONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.

                         WOODY
            Ah-hah!  There you are!!

Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey!  What's he doing?

Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car
out onto the street.  The other toys SCREAM in horror.

                         REX
            He's at it again!

INTERCUT - EXT. STREET/INT. REAR OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud
and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.

RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.

The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to
cross the intersection.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pointing at Woody)
            Get him!!!

All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no!

Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid
the angry mob of toys.

Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards the
moving truck.

Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on
Buzz --

Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!
                   (as Rocky spins him)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts
doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.

                         BUZZ
                   (spinning)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

Rocky throws Woody to the floor.

-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud
giving close chase.

Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.

                         HAMM
            Pig pile!!

-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off.
Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards.

ANGLE: TRAFFIC LIGHT

It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.

Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.

Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a
halt just missing a car.  The car swerves and CRASHES into
another car.  Soon there is a multi-car pile up that
encircles Scud, entrapping the dog.

Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on
the other side.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and
head for the open back.

                         WOODY
            No wait!  You don't understand!
            Buzz is out there!  We've gotta
            help him!!

            Toss 'im overboard!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait!

The toys toss him out into the road.  As the truck drives
off, the toys CHEER.

            So long Woody!

Shaken, Woody tries to get up again when...

BUZZ & RC

come barreling towards him.

                         BUZZ
            Who-o-o-oa!  Woody!

The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.

Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holding
the remote).

                         WOODY
            Well, thanks for the ride.

                         BUZZ
                   (pointing ahead)
            Look out!!

The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car
that had passed over Woody earlier.

Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote a
hard left, missing the tire by inches.  The RC Car moves up
under the car.

                         WOODY
            Now let's catch up to that truck!

Woody flicks a switch from "ON" to "TURBO."

The RC Car speeds up towards the moving truck.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The toys are busy CONGRATULATING one another when Lenny, the
wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and
Woody.

                         LENNY
            Guys!  Guys!  Woody's riding RC!
            And Buzz is with him!

The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.

                         BO PEEP
            Rocky!  The ramp!

Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side
of the back.  The sign above it reads "RAMP: UP/DOWN."
Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  The ramp begins to lower.

Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down
right on top of them.

                         BUZZ
            Look out!!

The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into
the road.  Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the
pavement.

                   (to other toys)
            Quick!  Hold on to my tail!

Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing
Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.

Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.
Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab
Slinky's hand.

They grab hold of one another.

All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pulling
Slinky's front end off the ramp.

                         SLINKY
            Woody!!

His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...

            The batteries!  They're running out!

RC's headlight eyes sag.  The car slows even more.

As Slinky continues stretching.  The RC Car begins to weave
side-to-side like a water skier.

                         SLINKY
            Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!

INT. FAMILY VAN

The RC Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and then
back out.

Molly SQUEALS with delight.

EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins
to lose his grip on Woody.

                         SLINKY

                         WOODY
            Slink!  Hang on!

Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into
the moving truck and knocking over all the toys.

The RC Car sputters to a stop.

Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving
truck disappear.

Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.

Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put
there earlier.

                   (continued)
            Yes!  Thank you, Sid!

Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against
RC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...

A CAR

whizzes right over them, blowing out the match.

Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls
prostrate to the ground.

                         WOODY
            No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o!

Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing
his helmet to block the sun from Woody.

As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and
looks at his hand.

A WHITE HOT DOT

like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears
on the back of Woody's hand.

Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the
white dot hits the tip of the fuse.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?

                         WOODY

Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.

            Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.
            Rockets explo --

The RC Car rockets forward.  Speeding along the dividing
line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the
moving truck can be seen on the horizon.

The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and
Woody off the RC Car.  Woody manages to continue holding
onto RC -- but not for long.

The toys CHEERING turns to SCREAMING as they rush to get out

                         REX
            Take cover!!

Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.

RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying.

The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.

                         WOODY
            Ahhh!! This is the part where we
            blow up!

                         BUZZ
            Not today!

Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.

WINGS

jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket.
The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.

The toys plummet.

                         WOODY
                   (covering his eyes)
            Ah-h-h-h-h!!

Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward
again.  Woody takes a peek.

They're flying.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!

                         BUZZ
            This isn't flying.  This is
            falling -- with style!

                         WOODY
            Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!

They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass
over it.

                         WOODY
            Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!

                         BUZZ
            We're not aiming for the truck!

ANGLE: FAMILY VAN

Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then
drop into the car.

INT. FAMILY VAN - CONTINUOUS

Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box
in the back seat right next to Andy.

Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the
box.

                         ANDY
            Hey!  Wow!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            What?  What is it?

                         ANDY
                   (picking up the toys)
            Woody!  Buzz!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, great, you found them.  Where
            were they?

                         ANDY
            Here!  In the car!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            See?  Now, what did I tell you?
            Right where you left them.

Andy hugs both toys.

CLOSE UP - WOODY AND BUZZ

They give each other a knowing wink.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING - LIVING ROOM BAY
WINDOW

Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be
seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.

                         ANDY
            Which one can I open first?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Let's let Molly open one.

INT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS TREE

One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal...

THE SARGENT

The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his
binoculars.  He turns and motions back into the tree.

INT. CHRISTMAS TREE

A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported
by several green army men.  One of the soldiers turns it on.

INT. ANDY'S NEW BEDROOM

The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand.
It CRACKLES WITH STATIC.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over the monitor)
            Frankincense, this is Myrrh.  Come
            in, Frankincense.

Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the
nightstand alongside the monitor.  They listen intently.

                         HAMM
                   (to the room)
            Hey, heads up everybody!  It's
            showtime.

Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like a
typical office Christmas party.

                         REX
            Oh!  It's time!

The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.

Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to
reveal...

BO PEEP

                         WOODY
            Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!
                   (rubbing his neck)
            There's gotta be a less painful way
            to get my attention.

                         BO PEEP
            Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched
on a shelf dangling mistletoe.

                         WOODY
            Say, isn't that mistletoe?

                         BO PEEP
            Mm-hmmmmm.

Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him.

The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor
restless with "excitement" not fear.

                         REX
                   (to Slinky)
            Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,
            like a leaf-eater.  That way, I
            could play the, uh, dominant
            predator.  Ha ha ha!

Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.

                         BUZZ
            Quiet everyone, quiet!

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.
            Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.
            Potato Head.

                         HAMM
            Way to go, Idaho!

All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gee, I better shave.

Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.

Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.  Lipstick now
covers Woody's face.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now
            opening his first present --
                   (STATIC)


Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  Nothing.

                         WOODY
            Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not
            worried, are you?

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            I can't quite make out --
                   (STATIC)

                         BUZZ
                   (defensively)
            Me?  No, no, no, no...
                   (beat)
            Are you?

                         WOODY
                   (laughing)
            Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly
            get that is worse than you?!

We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, what is it?  What is it?

SFX: BARKING

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  A puppy!

We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz and
Woody.

They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and
LAUGH WEAKLY.

                                            FADE OUT.

                         "TOY STORY"

FADE IN:

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They
are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the
impression of sky.

One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED"
poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.

A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The
VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting
out all the voices of the scene.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Alright everyone, this is a stick-
            up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty
            that safe!

A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the
"BANK" box.

Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.
Potato Head kisses the coins.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.
                   (kissing noises)


A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought
into the scene.

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old
            potato!

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get
            run over!

The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a
Hot Wheels track loop.

                         ANDY (AS SHEEP)
            Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do
            something!

WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene
opposite the inanimate spud.

Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.

Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Are you gonna come quietly?

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            You can't touch me Sheriff!  I
            brought my attack dog with a built-
            in force field!

Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in
front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who
            eats force field dogs!!

Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the
Slinky Dog.

                         ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)
            AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!

                         ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)
            YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            You're goin' to jail, Bart.

Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib
in the room.

A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "JAIL"
written in crayon.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Say good-bye to the wife and
            tatertots.

Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.
Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to
pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,
forcing some of his parts loose.

Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the
floor.

                         ANDY
                   (pulling Woody's string)
            You saved the day again, Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            You're my favorite deputy.

BEGIN TITLES

SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does
various activities with Woody:

-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows
drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends
Woody is lassoing the cattle.

                         ANDY
            C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.

-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)
car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib.

INT. STAIRWELL

-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister
allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and
catches him at the bottom.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM

-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around
and around.

Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.

Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.

                         ANDY
                   (raising his arms)
            Score!

SONG ENDS

Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to
his mother.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  Cool!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Whadda ya think?

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANGLE: THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM

MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just
finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A
banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: "Happy
Birthday Andy."

Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
decorations.

                         ANDY
            Can we leave this up 'til we move?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Well, sure, we can leave it up.

                         ANDY
            Yeah!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Now go get Molly.  Your friends are
            going to be here any minute.

                         ANDY
            Okay.

Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.

                         ANDY
            It's party time, Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging
Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat
at her.

                         ANDY
            Howdy, Little Lady!

He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last
time.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.

                         ANDY
                   (picking up Molly)
            C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting
            heavy!
                   (to Woody)
            See ya later, Woody.

Andy exits.

END TITLES

Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his
expression changing from a smile to worry.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pull my string!  The birthday
            party's today?!

Woody thinks.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.

The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the
closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.

POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits
himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ages three and up.  It's on my box.
            Ages three and up!  I'm not
            supposed to be babysitting Princess
            Drool.

HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin
slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces
are in the wrong slots.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!
                         HAMM
            I don't get it.

Hamm walks away.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You uncultured swine!
                   (to someone O.S.)
            What are you looking at, ya hockey
            puck?!

Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.

Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on
the night stand.

                         WOODY
            Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

                         SARGENT
                   (saluting)
            Sir!  No Sir!

                         WOODY
            Okay, thank you.  At ease.

Woody hops off the bed.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Slinky?

                         SLINKY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody!

A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing
out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on
the board.

                         SLINKY
            I'm red this time.

                         WOODY
            No, Slink --

                         SLINKY
            Oh...well alright, you can be red
            if you want.

                         WOODY
            Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad
            news.

                         SLINKY
            Bad news?!

                         WOODY
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!

Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in
the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Just gather everyone up for a staff
            meeting and be happy!!

                         SLINKY
            Got it.

Slinky shuffles off.

                         WOODY
            Be HAPPY!

Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.

Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy
ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Staff meeting, everybody.
                   (aside)
            Snake, Robot -- podium duty.

Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly
follow Woody.

Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other
direction.

                         WOODY
            Hey Etch!  Draw!

Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.

Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch
etches a gun on its screen.

                         WOODY
                   (pretending to be shot)
            Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've
            been working on that draw.  Fastest
            knobs in the west.

Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            Got a staff meeting, you guys, come
            on, let's go!

Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of
Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.

                         WOODY
            Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,
            who moved my doodle pad way over here?

Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...

REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.

                         REX
            ROOAAAARR!!!

                         WOODY
                   (unaffected)
            Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

Rex suddenly turns timid.

                         REX
            Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

                         WOODY
            I was close to being scared that time.

Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.

                         REX
            I'm going for fearsome here, but I
            just don't feel it.  I think I'm
            just coming off as annoying.

A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO
PEEP, the porcelain figurine.

                         WOODY
                   (choking)
            Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

                         BO PEEP
            I wanted to thank you, Woody, for
            saving my flock.

                         WOODY
                   (blushing)
            Oh, hey - it was nothing.

                         BO PEEP
            Whadda ya say I get someone else to
            watch the sheep tonight?

                         WOODY
                   (very flustered)
            Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of
ABC blocks.

                         BO PEEP
            Remember, I'm just a couple of
            blocks away.

Woody is left lovestruck.

All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up
            front.

Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody!  C'mon!

Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.

The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and
indicates his microphone.

                         MIKE
            Ahem!

                         WOODY
                   (grabbing microphone)
            Oh, thanks, Mike.
                   (to the crowd)
            Okay --

                         WOODY
                   (to Mike)
            Oh, whoa, step back --

Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.

                         WOODY
            Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.
            Everybody hear me?  Up on the
            shelf, can you hear me?  Great!
            Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.
            Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

The toys all MOAN.

                         HAMM
            Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!

                         REX
            Well I didn't know we were supposed
            to have one already.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (waving his arm out
                   its socket)
            Do we have to hold hands?

The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a
            big joke.  We've only got one week
            left before the move.  I don't want
            any toys left behind.  A moving
            buddy -- if you don't have one, get
            one!
                   (checking the pad)
            Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.
            Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion
            Awareness" meeting was, I think, a
            big success and we want to thank Mr.
            Spell for putting that on for us.
            Thank you, Mr. Spell.

The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr. Spell's display
screen as he speaks.

                         MR. SPELL
            You're welcome.

                         WOODY
            Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note
            here...
                   (under his breath)
            Andy's birthday party's been moved
            to today.
                   (full voice)
            Next we have --

The toys all PANIC.

                         REX
            What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's
            today?!  His birthday's not 'til
            next week!!

                         HAMM
            What's going on down there?  Is Mom
            losing her marbles?!

                         WOODY
            Well, obviously she wanted to have
            the party before the move.  I'm not
            worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Of course Woody ain't worried!
            He's been Andy's favorite since
            kindergarten!

                         SLINKY
            Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!
            If Woody says it's all right, then,
            well, darnit, it's good enough for
            me.  Woody has never steered us
            wrong before.

While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and
mimes kissing his own butt.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and
            birthday we go through this.

                         REX
            But what if Andy gets another
            dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just
            don't think I can take that kind of
            rejection.

                         WOODY
            Hey, listen, no one's getting
            replaced.  This is Andy we're
            talking about.

Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            It doesn't matter how much we're
            played with.  What matters is that
            we're here for Andy when he needs
            us.  That's what we're made for.
            Right?
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.

                         HAMM
            Pardon me.  I hate to break up the
            staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!
            Birthday guests at three o'clock!

                         WOODY
            Stay calm, everyone!!

Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards
the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.

                         WOODY
            Uh, meeting adjourned.

The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get
a peek outside.

                         HAMM
            Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at
            all those presents?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I can't see a thing!

Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out
of his head and holds them up over the other toys.

ANGLE: TOY'S POV OF ANDY'S FRONT YARD

CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.

                         HAMM
            Yessir, we're next month's garage
            sale fodder for sure.

                         REX
                   (panicked)
            Any dinosaur-shaped ones?

                         HAMM
            Ah, for crying out loud, they're
            all in boxes, you idiot!

The presents keep coming.

                         REX
            They're getting bigger.

                         SLINKY
            Wait!  There's a nice little one
            over there!

At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but
then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  The
toys SCREAM.

                         MR. SPELL
            Spell the word "trashcan."

                         REX
            We're doomed!

Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in
surrender.

                         WOODY
            Alright!  Alright!

The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            If I send out the troops, will you
            all calm down?

                         REX
            Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

                         WOODY
            Okay, save your batteries!

                         HAMM
            Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using
            the old noodle.

Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on
the nightstand.

                         WOODY
            Sargent.  Establish a recon post
            downstairs.  Code red.  You know
            what to do.

                         SARGENT
            Yes SIR!

The green army man hops down to the floor where a "BUCKET O'
SOLDIERS" sits.

                         SARGENT
            Alright men, you heard him.  Code
            Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!
            Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!
            Let's move move move!!

THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in
formation across the bedroom floor.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for
the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.

The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars.

ANGLE: SARGENT'S BINOCULAR VIEW OF DOWNSTAIRS

Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway
rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the
            living room.  It's almost time for
            the presents.

Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the
Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.

TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting
down to the floor below.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,
then give the "all clear" sign.

The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed
the receiving half of the baby monitor.

                         WOODY
            And this --
                   (turning on the baby monitor)
            -- is how we find out what is in
            those presents.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

The green army men march in formation across the floor when
suddenly...

SFX: FOOTSTEPS

Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze
in their various classic action poses.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the
            chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and
            Barbeque --

The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top
of a soldier.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,
            I thought I told him to pick these up.

With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of
her path and continues on to the living room.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

                         REX
            Shouldn't they be there by now?
            What's taking them so long?!

                         WOODY
            Hey, these guys are professionals.
            They're the best.  C'mon, they're
            not lying down on the job.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room.

The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The
Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.

                         WOUNDED SOLDIER
                   (moans)
            Go on without me.  Just go!

                         SLINKY
            A good soldier never leaves a man
            behind.

The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower
themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once
downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant.  Suddenly...

A BALL

bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor.

The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS

While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates
the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal.

The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF BIRTHDAY PRESENTS

The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room
coffee table.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
            There they are.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby
monitor.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)

                   (off Rex's look)
            Hey, I can dream, can't I?

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            The bow's coming off...he's ripping
            the wrapping paper...it's
            a...it's...it's a lunchbox!  We've
            got a lunchbox, here!

                         WOODY
            A lunchbox?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            A lunchbox...?!

                         SLINKY
            For lunch.  Heh heh heh...

                   (over monitor)
            Ok, second present...it appears to
            be...okay, it's bed sheets.

The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.

            Yeah, alright!!

Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,
sending his facial features flying.

            Hey, watch it!

                         HAMM
            Sorry there, old Spudhead.

            Mission accomplished.  Well done,
            men.  Pack it up, we're going home.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

                         WOODY
            So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to
            worry about.

                         SLINKY
            I knew you were right all along,
            Woody.  Never doubted you for a
            second.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT

The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we
            have here?!

The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF LIVING ROOM

Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out
another large present.

                         SARGENT
                   (indicating the baby monitor)
            Wait -- turn that thing back on!

            Come in, Mother Bird, come in,
            Mother Bird.

All the toys tense up.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (continued)
            Mom has pulled a surprise present
            from the closet.  Andy's opening it...

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS

                         SARGENT
            He's really excited about this one.
            It's a huge package.  Oh -- get
            out -- one of the kids is in the
            way, I can't see...

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (from monitor)
            ...it's...it's a --

The sound of children CHEERING emits from the monitor,
cutting off the Sargent.

                         REX
            It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!

Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the
monitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteries
to roll out.

                         REX
            Oh, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never
            know what it is!

                         HAMM
                   (sarcastic)
            Way to go, Rex.

Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  Potato Head tries to
correctly insert the batteries.

                         WOODY
            No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em
            around!

                         HAMM
            Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!

                         WOODY
            Plus is positive, minus is negative!
            Oh, let me!

Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and Potato
Head aside.

INT. LIVING ROOM

                         ANDY
            Let's go to my room, guys!

The kids rush past the houseplant.

                         SARGENT
                   (into the monitor)
            RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  ANDY IS
            COMING UPSTAIRS!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Woody puts the last battery back in.

                         WOODY
            There.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat!
            Resume your positions NOW!

                         WOODY
            Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to
            your places.  Hurry!

The toys PANIC and scatter about the room.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear?
            Did you see my ear?

                         REX
            Outta my way!  Here I come, here I
            come --

Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.

Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPS
grow louder.

Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...

Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's
feet rush in.

                         FRIEND #1
            Hey, look!  His lasers light up.
                         ANDY
            Take that, Zurg!

Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down
the gap between the bed and the back wall.

                         FRIEND #2
            Quick!  Make a space!  This is
            where the spaceship lands.

                         ANDY
            -- and you press his back and he
            does a karate-chop action!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Come on down, guys.  It's time for
            games!  We've got prizes!

                         ANDY
            Oh, yeah!

The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE
DOOR behind them.

BEAT

The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            What is it?

                         BO PEEP
            Can you see it?

                         SLINKY
            What the heck is up there?

                         REX
            Woody?  Who's up there with you?

Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shocked
to discover him there.

                         SLINKY
            Woody, what are you doing under the
            bed?

                         WOODY
                   (composing himself)
            Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing.
            I'm sure Andy was just a little
            excited, that's all.  Too much cake
            and ice cream, I suppose.  It's
            just a mistake.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in
            your spot, Woody.

                         REX
                   (GASP!)
            Have you been replaced?

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What did I tell you earlier?
            No one is getting replaced.

The toys give each other a look of doubt.

                         WOODY
            Now let's all be polite, and give
            whatever it is up there a nice, big
            "Andy's Room" welcome.

Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the
edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...

BUZZ LIGHTYEAR

We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age
action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head
to toe.  The imposing "G.I. Joe-sized" doll stands heroically
in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.

Woody GULPS.

Buzz comes alive and looks around.

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

While he scans the bedroom a "DARTH VADER" LIKE BREATHING is
heard.

Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.

SFX: ELECTRONIC BEEP

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
            Come in, Star Command.

Nothing.  He pushes the button again.

                         BUZZ
            Star Command - come in.  Do you
            read me?
                   (to himself)
            Why don't they answer?!!
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  The
box is designed to look like a spaceship.

                         BUZZ
                   (GASP)
            My ship!!

He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.

                         BUZZ
            Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!

Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
            Stardate 4072: My ship has run off
            course en route to sector 12.  I've
            crash landed on a strange planet.
            The impact must have awoken me from
            hyper-sleep.

Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            Terrain seems a bit unstable...

He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            No read-out yet if the air is
            breathable... and there seems to be
            no sign of intelligent life
            anywhere --

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

Woody's face suddenly pops into view.

                         WOODY
            Hello-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            HO-YAAAHH!!!

Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.  He presses a
button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on
his wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and
holds it there.

                         WOODY
            Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I
            frighten you?  Didn't mean to.
            Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody
            and this is Andy's room.  That's
            all I wanted to say, and also,
            there has been a bit of a mix-up.
            This is my spot, see, the bed here --

While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on
Woody's vest.

                         BUZZ
                   (de-activating his
                   laser beam)
            Local law enforcement!  It's about
            time you got here.  I'm Buzz
            Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe
            Protection Unit.  My ship has crash
            landed here by mistake.

Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.
Woody tries to keep up.

                         WOODY
            Yes, it is a mistake, because, you
            see, the bed, here, is my spot.

                         BUZZ
            I need to repair my turbo boosters.
            Do you people still use fossil
            fuels, or have you discovered
            crystalic fusion?

                         WOODY
            Well, let's see, we've got double
            A's --

                         BUZZ
            Watch yourself!!

Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist
laser.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Halt!  Who goes there?!

The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.

                         REX
            Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!

                         BUZZ
                   (to Woody)
            Do you know these life forms?

                         WOODY
            Yes.  They're Andy's toys.

                         BUZZ
            Alright, everyone.  You're clear to
            come up.

Buzz walks over to the toys.

                         BUZZ
            I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.

Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.

                         REX
            Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you...
                   (pulls away)
            Now thank you all for your kind
            welcome.

                         REX
            Say!  What's that button do?

                         BUZZ
            I'll show you.

Buzz presses a button on his chest.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

The toys all GASP IN AWE.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody's got something like
            that.  His is a pullstring, only
            it --

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

                         HAMM
            Oh yeah, but not like this one.
            This is a quality sound system.
            Probably all copper wiring, huh?
            So, uh, where are you from?
            Singapore?  Hong Kong?

                         BUZZ
            Well...no, actually I'm stationed
            up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector
            4.  As a member of the elite
            Universe Protection Unit of the
            Space Ranger Corps, I protect the
            galaxy from the threat of invasion
            from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn
            enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz
arrived.

ANGLE: BACK OF BUZZ'S BOX

There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word-
for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.

                         REX
            And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not
            actually  from Mattel, I'm actually
            from a smaller company that was
            purchased in a leveraged buy-out.
            Well, I don't really understand the
            financials, but...

Woody walks over to Bo Peep.

                         WOODY
            You'd think they've never seen a
            new toy before.

                         BO PEEP
            Well sure, look at him.  He's got
            more gadgets on him then a Swiss
            army knife.

Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his
laser light.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You
            don't want to be in the way when my
            laser goes off.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, a laser!  How come you don't
            have a laser, Woody?

                         WOODY
            It's not a laser!  It's a little
            lightbulb that blinks!

                         HAMM
            What's with him?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Laser-envy.

                         WOODY
            All right, that's enough.  Look,
            we're all very impressed with
            Andy's new toy --

                         BUZZ
            Toy?

                         WOODY
            T-O-Y.  Toy.

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me, I think the word you're
            searching for is Space Ranger.

                         WOODY
            The word I'm searching for I can't
            say because there's pre-school toys
            present.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

                         REX
            Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm
            curious.  What does a Space Ranger
            actually do?

                         WOODY
            He's not a Space Ranger!  He
            doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers
            or fly --

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me.

Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.

Again the toys GASP IN AWE.

                         HAMM
            Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!

                         WOODY
            Oh, what?!...What?!  These are
            plastic.  He can't fly!

                         BUZZ
            They are a terillium-carbonic alloy
            and I CAN fly.

                         WOODY
            No, you can't.

                         BUZZ
            Yes, I can.

                         WOODY
            You can't!

                         BUZZ
            Can!

                         WOODY
            Can't!  Can't!  Can't!

                         BUZZ
            I tell you, I could fly around this
            room with my eyes closed!

                         WOODY
            Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.

                         BUZZ
            All right, then, I will.
                   (to toys)
            Stand back everyone!

The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the
edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost.  He poses like a
high diver, shuts his eyes...

                         BUZZ
            To infinity and beyond!!

...and leaps off the bed.

Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and
bounces right back up.

He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the
track, through the loop, and off a ramp.  Buzz soars upward
into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.

Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.  The impact
turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around
and around.

All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.

Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from
the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.

Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and
then opens his eyes.

                         BUZZ
            Can.

The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH
ADORATION.

                         REX
            Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew
            magnificently!

                         BO PEEP
            I found my moving buddy!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you.  Thank you all.
            Thank you.

                         WOODY
            That wasn't flying!  That was
            falling with style!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Man, the dolls must really go for
            you!
                   (aside)
            Can you teach me that?

Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.
Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.

                         SLINKY
            Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --

                         WOODY
            Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,
            everything will be just the way it
            was.  They'll see... they'll see.
            I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

MONTAGE

SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER

A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,
running around the room.

B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.  Next he "lands" Buzz
Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's
laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if
he'd been blown away by the laser.

C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and
cowboy pajamas.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:

Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas
and a homemade spaceman's helmet.

                         ANDY
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom
transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the
wall, the pillow, the bedspread.

E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space ranger
suggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this
time giving a "JURASSIC PARK" ROAR.

The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.

F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of
Buzz.

Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's
hair, chatting away like a hair dresser.

Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.

G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys
as weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,
using his feet as a treadmill.

Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends
up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the
barbell.

H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the
checkerboard.

Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and
Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on
top of ABC blocks for repair.

In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the
pieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the
dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.

I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is
stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's
wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.

Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his
front end no choice but to eventually follow.

J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until
just Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which
toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next
to him.

Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks
back into the box, closing the lid to...

BLACK

The black screen splits horizontally to become...

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - MORNING - WOODY'S POV OF THE BEDROOM
FROM THE TOY BOX

All is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lid
of the toy box.

                         WOODY
            Finally!

He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers
that his hat is missing.

                         WOODY
                   (looking back into
                   the toy box)
            Hey!  Who's got my hat?

The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.

                         SHARK
            Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!

                         WOODY
                   (sarcastic)
            Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!
                   (grabs the hat)
            Give me that!

Woody leaps out of the toy box.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.
            Let me show you something.  It
            looks as though I've been accepted
            into your culture.

Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his
            name on me.

Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the
sole of his boot.

The name "ANDY" is written on it in permanent marker.

                         SLINKY & REX
            Wow!

                         REX
            With permanent ink, too!

                         BUZZ
            Well, I must get back to repairing
            my ship.

Buzz walks away.

Woody looks at HIS foot -- "Andy" is written on it also but
in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.

                         BO PEEP (O.S.)
            Don't let it get to you, Woody.

Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly
straightens up.

                         WOODY
                   (nonchalant)
            Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what
            do you mean?  Who?

                         BO PEEP
            I know Andy's excited about Buzz,
            but you know, he'll always have a
            special place for you.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (walking past)
            Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

                         WOODY
            Alright!  That's it!

Woody angrily marches across the room.

Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the
ABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under
the ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waiting
for instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.

                         BUZZ
            Unidirectional bonding strip.

Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape
dispenser.

                         ROBOT
            Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!

Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.

Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot
and rolls him out from under the ship.

                         WOODY
            Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away
            from Andy.  He's mine, and no one
            is taking him away from me.

                         BUZZ
            What are you talking about?
                   (to Robot)
            Where's that bonding strip?!

Buzz rolls himself back under.  Woody rolls him out again.

                         WOODY
            And another thing.  Stop with this
            spaceman thing.  It's getting on my
            nerves.

                         BUZZ
            Are you saying you want to lodge a
            complaint with Star Command?
                         WOODY
            Oh okay, so you want to do it the
            hard way, huh?

Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Don't even think about it, cowboy!

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, tough guy?!

Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a
button that makes the spaceman's helmet open.

Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.  He drops to his knees
and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.

Woody is unsure how to react.

Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.

                         BUZZ
            The air isn't toxic.

Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.

                         BUZZ
            How dare you open a spaceman's
            helmet on an uncharted planet!  My
            eyeballs could've been sucked from
            their sockets!

Buzz closes his helmet.

                         WOODY
            You actually think you're THE "Buzz
            Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I
            thought it was an act!
                   (to the room)
            Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL
            Buzz Lightyear!

                         BUZZ
            You're mocking me, aren't you?

                         WOODY
            Oh, no, no, no...
                   (pointing behind Buzz)
            Buzz, look!  An alien!

                         BUZZ
            Where?

Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.

Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.

SFX: DOG BARKING

Woody stops short.  All the toys look to the bedroom window.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...

                         WOODY
            Uh-oh.

Slinky hides under the bed.

                         SLINKY
            It's Sid!

                         REX
            I thought he was at summer camp!

                         HAMM
            They must have kicked him out early
            this year.

The toys rush over to the window.

                         REX
            Oh, no!  Not Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            ...Incoming!

From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year-
old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumping
around in their backyard.

A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.
Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his
leash, barking wildly.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Who is it this time?

                         WOODY
            I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?

                         LENNY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody.

Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars,
approaching him from the other end of the desk.  Woody picks
Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.

                         REX
            Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one
            of these again!

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID'S BACKYARD

A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the
center of the backyard.  A huge M-80 is strapped to the
doll's back with masking tape.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (plays under the next
                   5 lines)
            Just stay where you are, Corporal!
            Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up.
            I know you're tired!  I know your
            leg is cramping, but you can't move.
            Do you hear me?

Buzz breaks through the crowd.

                         BUZZ
            What's going on?

                         WOODY
            Nothing that concerns you spacemen.
            Just us TOYS.

                         BUZZ
            I'd better take a look anyway.

Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.

                         BUZZ
            Why is that soldier strapped to an
            explosive device?

                         WOODY
                   (redirecting Buzz's view)
            That's why.  Sid.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF THE DOG, SCUD

                         BUZZ
            Sure is a hairy fellah.

                         WOODY
            No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!

Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID

He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.

                         WOODY
            THAT is Sid!

                         BUZZ
            You mean that happy child?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That ain't no happy child.

                         REX
            He tortures toys -- just for fun.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then we've got to do something!

Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.  The toys GASP IN SHOCK.

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing?!!  Get down
            from there!

                         BUZZ
            I'm going to go teach that boy a
            lesson.

                         WOODY
            Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt
            him with your scary laser.

Woody presses Buzz's laser button.  It emits a WIMPY
ELECTRONIC BEEP.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Be careful with that, it's
            extremely dangerous.

While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting
the fuse of the M80.

                         LENNY
            He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!

                         SID (O.S.)
            NO-O-O-O-O!!!  CA-A-A-A-A-ARL!

                         LENNY
            Hit the dirt!

The toys jump away from the window.

SFX: EXPLOSION

Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of
Andy's house.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!

Andy's toys peek over the window sill.

ANGLE: SID'S YARD

A large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat
Carl once stood.  Sid jumps up and down victoriously while
Scud resumes his BARKING.

                         BUZZ
            I could have stopped him.

                         WOODY
            Buzz, I would love to see you try.
                   (gesturing to Sid's yard)
            'Course I'd love to see you as a
            crater.

Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.

                         BO PEEP
            The sooner we move the better.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ANDY'S FRONT YARD - SUNSET

A "FOR SALE" real estate sign stands in the front yard.
Another sign reading "SOLD" hangs from the bottom.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL/ANDY'S BEDROOM

Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.  The room is
full of packing boxes, most of them half full.  Andy is
playing with Woody and Buzz.

                         ANDY
            To infinity and beyond!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, all this packing makes me
            hungry.  What would you say to
            dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

                         ANDY
            Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!

Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right
on top of Woody.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Go wash your hands and I'll get
            Molly ready.

The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves
Buzz off of him.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Can I bring some toys?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            You can bring ONE toy...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Just one?

Woody perks up with concern.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            One toy?

He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away
towards the opposite end of the desk.

Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.
With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Will Andy pick me?

He tips the 8 ball over.  The triangular oracle floats up to
the surface.  Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.

                         WOODY
            Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!

Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.  It rolls across
the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.

Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk
and peers down it.

ANGLE: BACK OF THE DESK

The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.  The space is
a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.

Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.

He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's
pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with.
Right behind Buzz sits

THE RC CAR

It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the
8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.

Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!
            Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
            We've got trouble!

                         BUZZ
            Trouble?!
                   (looking around)
            Where?!

                         WOODY
                   (pointing to the back
                   of the desk)
            Down there.  Just down there.  A
            helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,
            Buzz!

                         BUZZ
            Then we've no time to lose!!

Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.

                         BUZZ
            I don't see anything!

Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.
RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.

                         WOODY
            Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep
            looking.

Woody hits the "FORWARD" button on the remote and steers the
RC Car straight for Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            What kind of a toy -- ?

Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.  He dives out
of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...

A BULLETIN BOARD

The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.  Buzz
ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk
like arrows.

POTATO HEAD

sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.

He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board
slams down onto...

A GLOBE

knocking it out of its stand.  The globe starts rolling
right at Buzz.

Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.

Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind
him, Indiana Jones style.  Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on
a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the
way onto the window ledge.

The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style
desklamp.  The arm of the lamp swings all the way around,
barely missing Woody...

...and knocks Buzz out the window.

                         TOYS
            BUZZ!!!!

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!!

Woody looks out the window.  No sign of Buzz.  All the other
toys rush over to the sill.

                         SLINKY
            I don't see him in the driveway!  I
            think he bounced into Sid's yard.

Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed.

                         REX
                   (GASP)
            Buzz!

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!

Rex looks over at RC.  The remote control car is bouncing up
and down excitedly.

                         REX
            Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say
            something!

The toys turn from the window to RC.

                         REX
                   (leaning down close
                   to RC)
            What is it, boy?

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            He's sayin' that this was no accident.

                         TOYS
            Huh?

                         BO PEEP
            What do you mean?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...
                   (pointing at Woody)
            ...by Woody.

                         TOYS
            WHAT?!?

The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute.  You -- you don't
            think I meant to knock Buzz out the
            window, do you Potato Head?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you
            back-stabbin' murderer!

                         WOODY
            Now, it was an accident!  Guys,
            c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me

                         SLINKY
            We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?

                         REX
                   (backing away)
            Oh, I don't like confrontations.

The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.

                         SARGENT
            Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You
            are an absolute disgrace!  You
            don't deserve to --

Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.

Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on
            your playtime, could ya Woody?
            Didn't want to face the fact that
            Buzz just might be Andy's new
            favorite toy, so you got rid of him.
            Well, what if Andy starts playin'
            with me more, Woody, huh?  You
            gonna knock me outta the window, too?

Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the
desk -- trapped.

                         HAMM
            I don't think we should give him
            the chance.

Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.

                         SARGENT
            There he is, men!  Frag him!

The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all the
rest of the toys close in.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Let's string him up by his pull-
            string!

                         HAMM
            I got dibs on his hat!

                         BO PEEP
            Would you boys stop it?!

                         HAMM
            Tackle him!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can
            explain everything --

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy, c'mon!

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got
            to get Buzz.

                         SARGENT
            Retreat!

The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.

Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where
Woody is lying.  Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching
around the room.

                         ANDY
            Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            No, I haven't seen him.

Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            Psssst!

Woody looks across the room.

Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.
Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head
points an accusing finger in Woody's direction.

Woody GULPS.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy!  I'm heading out the door.

                         ANDY
            But Mom, I can't find him!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Well, honey, just grab some other
            toy!  Now c'mon!

                         ANDY
            Okay...

He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the
family van in the driveway.

                         ANDY
            I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I
            left him right there.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Honey, I'm sure he's around.
            You'll find him.

A BUSH

next to the van begins to rustle.  Hands part the foliage,
revealing Buzz.  He eyes Woody going into the van and does a
slow burn.

The van ENGINE STARTS UP.  Buzz races out of the bush, and
with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it
pulls out of the driveway.

ANGLE: SIDE OF ANDY'S HOUSE

A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable
distance above the ground.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window,
supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain."

                         SLINKY
            It's too short!  We need more monkeys!

                         REX
                   (holding up an empty barrel)
            There aren't any more!  That's the
            whole barrel.

Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.

                         REX
                   (yelling out window)
            Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working!
            We're formulating another plan!
            Stay calm!
                   (beat)
            Oh, where could he be?

EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps.

INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.

                         ANDY
            Can I help pump the gas?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly
sleeps up front in her car seat.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Yeah?!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Yeah -- when you're sixteen.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
                   (sarcastic)
            Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.

With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.  He
stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince
            those guys it was an accident?

Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!
            Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll
            find you here, he'll take us back
            to the room, and then you can tell
            everyone that this was all just a
            big mistake.  Huh?

No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare.

                         WOODY
                   (weakly)
            Right?  Buddy?

                         BUZZ
            I just want you to know that even
            though you tried to terminate me,
            revenge is not an idea we promote
            on my planet.

                         WOODY
            Oh.  Oh, that's good.

                         BUZZ
                   (getting in Woody's face)
            But we're not on my planet, are we?

                         WOODY
            No.

Buzz lunges for Woody.  The two toys fly off the seat and
out the open side door of the van.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked
in mortal combat.

                         WOODY
            Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of
            me?!

Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.

Woody lunges with all his might.  He smacks Buzz in the
face, making it SQUEAK with every blow.

Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.

                         WOODY
            Owwwww!!!

Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating
BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.

SFX: CAR DOOR SLAM

The toys stop fighting.  Before they can react...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Next stop...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!

The van drives off.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Andy?!

Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it
drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.

                         WOODY
            Doesn't he realize that I'm not
            there?
                   (beat)
            I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!

Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.  He flips open his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The
            local Sheriff and I seem to be at a
            huge refueling station of some
            sort --

Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to
seething anger.  He charges at Buzz.

                         WOODY
            You!

SFX: LOUD TRUCK HORN

Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a
behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.

Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where
he stands on the pavement.  The truck ROARS over him.

A GIGANTIC TIRE

stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.

Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back
under the truck until he bumps into Buzz.

                         BUZZ
                   (into wrist communicator)
            According to my nava-computer, the --

            Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

                         WOODY
            This is the perfect time to panic!
            I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're
            going to move from their house in
            two days and it's all your fault!!

                         BUZZ
            My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me
            out of the window in the first
            place --

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't
            shown up in your stupid little
            cardboard spaceship and taken away
            everything that was important to
            me --

                         BUZZ
            Don't talk to me about importance.
            Because of YOU the security of this
            entire universe is in jeopardy.

                         WOODY
                   (incredulous)
            WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!

Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the
stars.

                         BUZZ
            Right now, poised at the edge of

Woody explodes.

            YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the
            real Buzz Lightyear, you're an

            plaything!!!

Beat.

Buzz walks off.

            Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya
            looney!

Woody walks away in the opposite direction.

Woody takes a step forward and then stops.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  I can't show my face in
            that room without Buzz.

Woody runs back under the tanker truck.  Buzz is at the far
end of the truck, walking away from Woody.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Buzz, come back!

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing to walk away)
            Go away.

Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and
then eyes...

ANGLE: DELIVERY TRUCK ROOF SIGN

Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo.

                         WOODY
            No, Buzz, you've gotta come back.
            I found a spaceship!

Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.

                         WOODY
            It's a spaceship, Buzz!

EXT. GAS STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the
            pizza's are getting cold here.

Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the
safety of a nearby oilcan display.

                         BUZZ
            Now you're sure this spacefreighter
            will return to its port of origin
            once it jettisons its food supply?

                         WOODY
            Uh-huh.  And when we get there,
            we'll be able to find a way to
            transport you...home.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then let's climb abroad.

Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the
pizza truck.  Woody chases after him.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's
            get in the back.  No one will see
            us there.

                         BUZZ
            Negative.  There are no restraining
            harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll
            be much safer in the cockpit.

In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear
view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a
            right, huh?

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            Yeah.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Okay, thanks for the directions.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

SFX: ENGINE STARTING

Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the
bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.

Woody lets out a YELL, as the back hatch slams back down on
his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.

INT. PIZZA PLANET DELIVERY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.

Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack of
pizzas in their insulated covers.  Buzz prudently fastens
his safety belt.

                         WOODY
            It'll be safer in the cockpit than
            the cargo bay.  What an idiot!

The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling
Woody to the back of the truck.

The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns
and hills at high speeds.  Woody is helplessly thrown around
the truck.  With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.

The truck climbs a steep hill.  Woody looks up just in time
to see...

A LARGE TOOL BOX

barreling towards him.

BAM!!!

                                            CUT TO:

A STAR-FILLED BLACK NIGHT SKY

We MOVE DOWN to reveal...

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - NIGHT

The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks.

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CAB - CONTINUOUS

After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the
passenger window.

ANGLE: THE FRONT ENTRANCE

Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.  As
CUSTOMERS approach the front, the guards part their crossed
"pizza spears," allowing the patrons to enter.

                         ROBOT GUARDS
            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS blare out from speakers:

                         MALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER
            Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for
            T-minus 30 minutes and counting...

                         FEMALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER
            The white zone is for eating pizza
            only.  The white zone is for...

Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and
truck bed.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!

Woody is gone.  Just the toolbox and strewn trash.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Sheriff?

The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody.  He peels off
the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.

                         BUZZ
            There you are.  Now the entrance is
            heavily guarded.  We need a way to
            get inside.

Woody rises from the trash with a "MEGA-GULP" cup on his head.

                         BUZZ
            Great idea, Woody!  I like your
            thinking!

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE

In the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containers
littered around it.  MORE CUSTOMERS approach the "guarded"
entrance.

                         ROBOT GUARDS
            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass
through.  Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container
and "MEGA-GULP" cup stand up.

                         BUZZ
                   (in burger container)
            NOW!

The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.

                         BUZZ
                   (in container)
            Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is
            closing.

INT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze
immediately as a GROUP OF KIDS run past, forcing the toys to
pose as discarded trash.

Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking.
Buzz bumps into Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (using straw as periscope)
            Ow!  Watch where you're going!

                         BUZZ
                   (mouthing with burger box)
            Sorry.

They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw
off their disguises.  They then take a good look at...

THE ARCADE

The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children
playing video games.  A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lights
overwhelm the place.

Buzz is beaming with hope.

                         BUZZ
            What a space port.  Good work, Woody.

Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but
none of the kids look familiar to him.  Just then he HEARS...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Mom, can I play Black Hole?
            Please, please, please?!

Woody turns around and through the video games he spots...

ANDY

standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Andy!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            What's Black Hole?

                         ANDY
            Oh, it's so cool...

The family begins to walk away.

                         BUZZ
            Now we need to find a ship that's
            headed for Sector 12 --

Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when
Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way!
            There's a special ship.  I just saw
            it!

                         BUZZ
            You mean it has hyperdrive?

                         WOODY
            Hyper-active hyperdrive, and
            astro...uh, turf.

The toys manage to get ahead of Andy.  Woody peeks around
the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and
Andy to approach.

                         WOODY
                   (tracking Andy and family)
            C'mon, c'mon, that's it...

                         BUZZ
            Where is it?  I don't see the --

Buzz stops short at the sight of...

A CRANE GAME

It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Spaceship.

                         WOODY
            Alright Buzz, get ready...

Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice,
his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.

                         WOODY
            Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're
            gonna jump in the basket --

Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone.  He looks across the
way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game
through the "PRIZE" slot.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.

It has already gone past.

                         WOODY
            Dooh!  No!  This cannot be
            happening to me!!

Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold
back for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.

INT. CRANE GAME

Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot
from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of...

SQUEEZE TOY ALIENS

There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute.

                         ALIEN #1
                   (excited)
            A stranger!

                         ALIEN #2
            From the outside!

                         ALIENS
            Oo-o-o-o-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            Greetings!  I am Buzz Lightyear!  I
            come in peace!

                         ALIENS
            Tell us!  What is it like outside?

The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children.

EXT. CRANE GAME

With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane
game and dives through the prize slot.

INT. CRANE GAME - CONTINUOUS

Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            This is an intergalactic emergency!
            I need to commandeer your vessel to
            Sector 12!

Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by
the cute alien toys.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued; to the aliens)
            Who's in charge here?

All the aliens point upward.

                         ALIENS
            The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!

Woody and Buzz look up.

ANGLE: CRANE GAME CLAW

It dangles directly above the toys.

                         ALIEN #1
            The claw is our master.

                         ALIEN #2
            The claw chooses who will go and
            who will stay.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            This is ludicrous.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (laughter)

Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.  He turns to
see Sid heading straight for the crane game.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  Sid!!!

Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the
two of them deep into the pile of aliens.

                         WOODY
            Get down!!

Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his
pants pocket.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I
            was --

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            YOU are the one that decided to
            climb into this --

                         ALIEN #4
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h-h.  The claw.  It moves.

ANGLE: CLAW

It moves into position and hovers directly above the area
where Woody and Buzz are hiding.

The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is
right on top of Buzz.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (whispering excitedly)
            I have been chosen!!

Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by
the claw.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (continued)
            Farewell, my friends!  I go on to a
            better place.

                         SID
            Gotcha!

With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,
forcing the space ranger to freeze.  Sid suddenly spots Buzz.

                         SID
            A Buzz Lightyear!  No way!

Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way
to escape.  Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes...

A SMALL REPAIR DOOR

Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.
He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few
attempts, is able to pry the door open.

The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and
grabs his head.

                         SID
            Yes!

The claw begins to lift Buzz up.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Buzz, NO!

Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.

Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.

Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of
aliens, out of Sid's view.

                         SID
                   (slamming his fist
                   against the glass)
            Wha -- ?  Hey!!

Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the
door with Buzz.  Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the
pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.

                         ALIEN #4
            He has been chosen.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What are you doing?

                         ALIEN #5
            He must go.

                         WOODY
            Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you
            zealots!

                         ALIENS
            He must go!  Do not fight the claw!
            Do not anger the claw!  He has been
            chosen.

Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the
air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid.

                         SID
            Alright!  Double prizes!

Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and
snatched up by Sid.

                         SID
                   (looking at his two
                   new toys)
            Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.

ANGLE: CLOSEUP OF SKULL ON SID'S T-SHIRT

                                          MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.  He
is HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying his
backpack in his hand.

Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path
towards the front door.

Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to
see Sid's house.  He recognizes Andy's house next door.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the
backpack.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling
            from here!  You're almost home.

                         ALIEN
            Nirvana is coming!  The mystic
            portal awaits!

                         WOODY
                   (to Alien)
            Will you be quiet?!!
                   (to both)
            You guys don't get it, do you?
            Once we go into Sid's house, we
            won't be coming out.

ANGLE: TOYS' POV FROM OUT BACKPACK

The front door opens to reveal Scud.  The dog lunges
straight for the backpack, BARKING.

                         SID
            Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good
            boy!

The dog begrudgingly obeys.

                         SID
            Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.

Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            FREEZE!!!

The toys go still.  Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the
backpack.  The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's
snout.

                         SID
            Ready, set, NOW.

In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in
his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.

Buzz and Woody react in horror.

                         SID
            Hannah!  Hey, Hannah!!!

Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail little
sister, carrying her Janie Doll.

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Did I get my package in the mail?

                         HANNAH
            I dunno.

                         SID
            Whaddaya mean, you don't know?

                         HANNAH
                   (insistent)
            I don't know!

                         SID
                   (mock concern)
            Oh no, Hannah!

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Look!  Janie!

He grabs the doll.

                         HANNAH
            Hey!!

                         SID
            She's sick!

                         HANNAH
                   (panic rising)
            No she's NOT --

                         SID
            I'll have to perform one of
            my...operations!

                         HANNAH
            NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!

Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit.

                         WOODY
            Not Sid's room...not there...

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

Sid races to his bedroom door.  Hannah is right behind.

                         HANNAH
            Sid!  Give her back!

Sid just LAUGHS.  He charges into the room and slams the
door in his sister's face.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
                   (pounding on his door)
            Sid!  Sid!...

Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over
to a makeshift workbench.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Oh, no.  We have a sick patient
            here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!

Sid CLICKS on a bare bulb dangling above his "operating
table."

Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as
Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Sid, give her back!  Give her back
            now!  I'm telling!

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Patient is...
                   (straining while
                   tightening vise)
            ...pre-e-epped.

Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it
like a surgeon's mask.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            No one's ever attempted a double
            bypass brain transplant before.

Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Now for the tricky part -- pliers!

                         BUZZ
                   (whispering to Woody)
            I don't believe that man's ever
            been to medical school.

Sid struggles for a moment with his "patient" then stops.

                         SID
                   (as Nurse)
            Doctor, you've done it!
                   (running to the door)
            Hannah?

He opens the door.  Hannah is standing there, looking worried.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Janie's all better now.

He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a
pterodactyl's.  Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of the
monstrosity and bolts down the hallway.

                         HANNAH
            MOM!!  MOM!!

                         SID
            She's lying!  Whatever she says
            it's not true!

Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah,
slamming the door behind him.

Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new
surroundings.  Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains
and power tools adorn the messy room.

They are in Hell...toy Hell.

                         WOODY
            We are gonna die.
                   (bolting out of the pack)
            I'm outta here!

Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to
open it.  No good.  Woody drops to the floor.

                         WOODY
            Locked!  There's gotta be another
            way out of here.

SFX: ROLLING SOUND

Woody is startled by the noise.

A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its
side.

Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes
it like a weapon.

Just then a shadow passes by Woody.  He turns quickly but
sees nothing.

                         WOODY
            Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?

Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.

He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.  Woody turns on the
flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the
noise, illuminating...

A BABY DOLL HEAD'S PROFILE

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!
            Come out here.  Do you know a way
            out of here?

The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one-
eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set
pieces.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP!!)

The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.
Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on
BABYFACE.

Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows:
a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with
a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack-
in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others).

Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            B-B-B-Buzz!

Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as
they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them
off into the shadows.

                         BUZZ
            They're cannibals!

Woody retreats back into the backpack.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters.  He punches a
button on his chest.

                         BUZZ
            May day!  May day!  Come in, Star
            Command!  Send reinforcements!...
                   (pause)
            Star Command, do you copy?

No response.

Buzz adjusts his laser light.  It emits a short BLIP.

                         BUZZ
                   (aiming his arm out
                   the pack)
            I've set my laser from stun to kill.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if
            anyone attacks us we can blink 'em
            to death.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while
Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on.

Some bushes rustle below.

                         REX
            Hey, you guys!  I think I've found
            him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!

Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.  The
annoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.

                         REX
            Whiskers!  Will you get out of
            here?!  You're interfering with the
            search and rescue.

SFX: APPROACHING CAR

Rex turns off the flashlight.

                         REX
                   (whispering)
            Look!  They're home!

The toys duck behind the sill.

The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway.  Andy and Mrs.
Davis get out.

                         ANDY
            Mom, have you seen Woody?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Where was the last place you left him?

                         ANDY
                   (searching the van)
            Right here in the van.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're
            just not looking hard enough.

                         ANDY
            He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.

The toys all look at one another.

                         BO PEEP
                   (GASP)
            Woody's gone?!

                         HAMM
            Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran
            away.

Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window.
                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was
            guilty.

                         REX
            Who would've thought he was capable
            of such atrocities?!

Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly
crestfallen.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW - DAY

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (as Interrogator)
            Oh, a survivor.  Where is the rebel
            base?  Talk!

SFX: HAND SLAP

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on
the floor.

Sid crosses to the window.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            I can see your will is strong.

Sid opens the window shade.  Bright sunlight shines down
onto Woody.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Well, we have ways of making you talk.

Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
focuses the beam on Woody's forehead.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            Where are your rebel friends now?
            Heh, heh.

A bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins
to smolder.

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!

Sid pulls the magnifying glass away.

                         SID
            Alright!!

Sid runs out of the room.  As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps
up SCREAMING, his forehead burning.

He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the
floor, and dunks his head in.

Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup
darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl.
Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like
glasses.

                         BUZZ
            Are you alright?
                   (whacking him on the back)
            I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A
            lesser man would have talked under
            such torture.

Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal
spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.

                         WOODY
            I sure hope this isn't permanent.

                         BUZZ
                   (checking his wrist communicator)
            Still no word from Star Command.
            We're not that far from the
            spaceport --

Woody's eyes light up.

ANGLE: SPOON

Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.  It's open.

                         WOODY
            The door!  It's open!  We're free!!

Woody runs for the door.  Buzz follows.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, we don't know what's out there!

                         WOODY
            I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

THE MUTANT TOYS

suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.  Woody
hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do
            something!  Quick!

                         BUZZ
            Shield your eyes!

Buzz fires his laser at them.  The little red beam just
flickers against Babyface's head.  The mutant toys look
confusedly at each other.

                         BUZZ
            It's not working.  I recharged it
            before I left.  It should be good
            for hours --

                         WOODY
            Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use
            your karate chop action!

Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant
toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's
arm involuntarily "chop" up and down.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutants)
            Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!

                         BUZZ
            Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that?
            Stop that!

                         WOODY
            Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!

Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,
continually chopping Buzz's arm.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, stop it!!

                         WOODY
            Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!

Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody races down the corridor...

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home...

...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,
and is confronted by...

SCUD

asleep on the landing.

Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.  He
slowly backs up the stairs.

Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the
hallway wall.  He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.

                         WOODY
                   (muffled gasp)


                         BUZZ
                   (whisper)
            Another stunt like that, cowboy --
            you're going to get us killed.

                         WOODY
                   (pulling Buzz's hand away)
            Don't tell me what to do!

                         BUZZ
            Shhh!

Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts
across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.
Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow.

Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and
meets up with Buzz.

As he stands...

WOODY'S PULLSTRING RING

gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.

The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that
Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther
until --

It SNAPS off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAA!!

Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's
voice box.

ANGLE: SCUD'S EYE

It opens.

Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            Giddy-up partner!...

GROWLING, Scud starts up the stairs.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...We got to get this wagon train a
            movin'!

Woody and Buzz take off running.

                         BUZZ
            Split up!

Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway.  Buzz
dives behind one while Woody jumps into...

A CLOSET

Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of
the landing.  CRASHED can be heard from behind the closet
door, getting Scud's attention.

Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND
GROWLING at the closet.

Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to
enter Buzz's doorway.

SFX: SNORING

The noise stops the dog in his tracks.  Both Scud and Buzz
look up to see...

INT. SID'S DAD'S DEN - CONTINUOUS

MR. PHILLIPS is asleep on a La-Z-Boy recliner in front of
the T.V.

Scud backs out and heads down the stairs.

Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...

                         SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV)
            Calling Buzz Lightyear!!  Come in

                         BUZZ
            Star Command!

Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to
speak into it when he is interrupted.

                         KID #1 (O.S.)
            Buzz Lightyear responding!  Read
            you loud and clear!

Buzz turns around to see...

A TELEVISION SET

Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of
stars.  The image quickly changes to two young boys playing
in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll.

                         SPACE COMMANDER
            Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching.  He walks
slowly towards the television set.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            The world's greatest superhero!

                         TV BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

Buzz presses the same button on his uniform.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

                         TV BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

On the TV screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears
to be launched through the air.  The words:  NOT A FLYING
TOY flash across the bottom of the screen.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   (non-excited lawyer voice)
            Not a flying toy.

Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Get your Buzz Lightyear action
            figure and save a galaxy near you!

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of
Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.

                         LOCAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Available at all Al's Toy Barn
            outlets in the tri-county area.

Buzz is stricken.  He looks down at his wrist communicator
and opens it.

ANGLE: WRIST COMMUNICATOR

Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: "MADE
IN TAIWAN."

SONG: "I WILL GO SAILING NO MORE" BEGINS

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.

As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up
through the railing at...

A SMALL WINDOW

It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.  A bird flies past.

The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head.

                         WOODY (V.O.)
            You are a toy!  You can't fly!

Buzz bows his head, defeated.

BEAT

Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.  He
slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny
its message of "Made in Taiwan."

Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.  He pops open
his wings, and aims himself towards the window above.

                         BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

Buzz leaps off the banister...

and falls.

In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull
farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz CRASHES on the entryway floor.

Buzz opens his eyes to see...

HIS SEVERED LEFT ARM

The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm
socket.

Buzz drops his head back in defeat.

SONG ENDS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            M-o-o-om?  Mom, have you seen my
            Sally doll?

Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps
on him.

                         MOM (O.S.)
            What, dear?  What was that?

Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles.

                         HANNAH
            Nevermind.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

ANGLE: CLOSET

The knob jiggles for a moment.  Suddenly, the door flies
open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights,
standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height.

Woody and the rest of the junk topple over.

A bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head.

                         WOODY
            Oo-o-of!
                   (to the hallway)
            Buzz?!  The coast is clear.  Buzz?
            Where are you?
                         BUZZ (O.S.; SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!  Let's go!!

Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights
with him.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Really?  That is so-o-o interesting.

Woody peeks into the open doorway of...

INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hannah is pretending to have a tea party.  Her guests are
dolls, headless dolls, that is except for...

BUZZ

He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly
apron and fashionable party hat.

                         HANNAH
                   (continued)
            Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?

                         WOODY
                   (under his breath)
            Buzz!

Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and
pours imaginary tea with it.

                         HANNAH
            It's so nice you could join us on
            such late notice.

Woody steps back into the hallway.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!

                         HANNAH
            What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit.  It
            goes quite well with your head.

Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further
down the hall.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                         WOODY
                   (high voice)
            Hannah!  Oh, Hannah!

Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.

                         HANNAH
                   (yelling out her room)
            Mom?
                   (to the dolls)
            Please excuse me, ladies.  I'll be
            right back.

As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down
onto the table.

Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and
walks downstairs.

                         HANNAH
            What is it, Mom?  Mom, where are you?

Woody bolts into Hannah's room.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Hey, Buzz!  Are you okay?

Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.

                         BUZZ
            Gone!  It's all go-o-one!  All of
            it's gone.  Bye-bye!  Whoo-hoo!
            See ya!

Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.

                         WOODY
            What happened to you?

                         BUZZ
            One minute you're defending the
            whole galaxy...
                   (pointing at other dolls)
            ...and suddenly you find yourself
            suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie
            Antoinette and her little sisters.

The headless dolls turn and wave.

Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on
the table.

                         WOODY
            I think you've had enough tea for
            today.
                   (helping Buzz up)
            Let's get you out of here, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
                   (grabbing Woody)
            Don't you get it?!  You see the hat?
            I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
                   (hysterical laughter)


                         WOODY
            Snap out of it, Buzz!

Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face
with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.

Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.
Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.

                         BUZZ
                   (sober)
            I'm sorry.  You're right.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            ...I'm just a little depressed,
            that's all.  I can get through this.

Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.

                         BUZZ
            Oh, I'm a sham!!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            Look at me!  I can't even fly out
            of a window!

Woody stops short.  He looks down the hallway in the
direction of Sid's room.

ANGLE: SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to
Andy's bedroom window.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            But -- the hat looked good.  Tell
            me the hat looked good!  The apron
            is a bit much, it's not my color...

                         WOODY
            Out the window...Buzz, you're a
            genius!

Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz
towards Sid's room.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            Come on, this way!

                         BUZZ
            Years of Academy training...wasted!!

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship.  Hamm's
wearing Potato Head's hat.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            B-3.

                         HAMM
            Miss.  G-6.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ohhh!  You sunk it!

                         HAMM
            Heh-heh.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Are you peeking?

                         HAMM
            Oh, quit your whining and pay up.

Potato Head reaches for his ear.

                         HAMM
            No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the
            nose.  C'mon!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pulling out his
                   nose; nasally)
            How 'bout three out of five?

He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...

                         WOODY (O.S.)
            Hey guys!  Guys!  Hey!

Both toys look across the way.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves to
the toys.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Son of a building block, it's Woody!

                         HAMM
            He's in the psycho's bedroom!

                         WOODY
            Hi!

                         HAMM
                   (into Andy's bedroom)
            Everyone, it's Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window.

                         BO PEEP
            Woody?!

                         REX
            You're kidding?

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!

INT. SID'S ROOM

                         WOODY
            We're gonna get outta here, Buzz --
            Buzz?

Buzz is not there.  Woody looks down at the floor.

Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing "bombs away" with his
broken arm.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW/SID'S WINDOW

The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody.

                         REX
            Hey, look!

                         BO PEEP
            Woody!

                         WOODY
            Boy, am I glad to see you guys!

                         SLINKY
            I knew you'd come back, Woody!

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing over there?

                         WOODY
            It's a long story, Bo.  I'll
            explain later.  Here, catch this!

Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over.  Slinky
catches them.

                         SLINKY
            I got it, Woody!

                         REX
                   (overly excited)
            He got it, Woody!

                         WOODY
            Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just
            tie it on to something!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea!
            How about we DON'T?!

Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Hey?!!

                         BO PEEP
            Potato Head!?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Did you all take stupid pills this
            morning?!  Have you forgotten what
            he did to Buzz?  And now you want
            to let him back over here?

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  You got it all wrong,
            Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz
            is right here.  He's with me!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You are a liar!

                         WOODY
            No, I'm not!
                   (to Buzz)
            Buzz, come over here and you just
            tell the nice toys that you're not
            dead.

ANGLE: BUZZ

He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker
on his wrist communicator.  He crumples it up and tosses it
aside.

                         WOODY
                   (to Andy's toys)
            Just a sec.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Will you get up here and
            give me a hand?!

Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by
Woody's feet.

                         WOODY
                   (insincerely)
            Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.
                   (exploding)
            This is serious!!

                         REX (O.S.)
            Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            He's lyin'.  Buzz ain't there.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S WINDOW

Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window.  He pretends to
notice something out of the other toy's view.

                         WOODY
                   (forced casualness)
            Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say
            "hello" to the guys over there?

BUZZ'S SEVERED ARM

suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of
sight.  Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz.

                         WOODY (AS BUZZ)
            Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and
            beyond!

                         REX
            Hey look!  It's Buzz!

                         WOODY
                   (shaking the arm's hand)
            Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the
            guys our new secret best-friends
            hand shake.  Gimme five, man!

                         HAMM
            Something's screwy here.

                         WOODY
            So, you see?  We're friends now,
            guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?
                   (as BUZZ)
            You bet.  Gimme a hug.

Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; as himself)
            Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.

                         SLINKY
            See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back
            the lights, Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait just a minute.  What are you
            trying to pull?!

                         WOODY
            Nothing.

Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up...

...exposing the severed arm.

The toys all SCREAM in horror.  Rex clasps his hands to his
mouth and turns away to BARF.

Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's
too late.

                         HAMM
            Oh, that is disgusting.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Murderer!

                         WOODY
            No!  No, no, no, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You murdering dog!

                         WOODY
            No, it's not what you think, I swear!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid
            pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!

Potato Head drops the lights.

                         WOODY
            No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave!
            You've gotta help us, please!  You
            don't know what it's like over here!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (to the other toys)
            Come on.  Let's get out of here.

                         HAMM
            Go back to your lives, citizens.
            Show's over.

All the toys leave the window except Slinky.

                         WOODY
            Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please!
            Please!  Listen to me!

Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!

SFX: THUNDER

As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the
window sill in defeat.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

BROKEN TOY SOUNDS emit from behind Woody.  He turns from the
window to see...

THE MUTANT TOYS

converging all around Buzz.

                         WOODY
            BUZZ!!

Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the
desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.

                         WOODY
            Go away, you disgusting freaks!

Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his
erector-set pinchers.

Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.

Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.

                         WOODY
            Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!

Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,
crashing into the wall.

By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of
mutant toys.

Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.

                         WOODY
            He is still alive, and you're not
            gonna get him, you monsters!

He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way
to...

BUZZ

He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.

Woody's anger turns to confusion.

                         WOODY
            Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!

Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real
when he looks to the mutants.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            But -- but they're cannibals.  We
            saw them eat those other toys.

The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's
last "operation": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.  Their
heads have been taped back on the correct bodies.

The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you
            were gonna...
                   (laughs nervously)
            ...you know, eat my friend.

Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark
corners of the room.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's
            wrong?

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!

                         WOODY
            Sid!!!

FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.  Woody tries to pick up the
still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz,
            you're...
                   (GRUNT)
            ...get up...

Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their
progress is too slow.  He shakes Buzz hard.

                         WOODY
            Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But
            don't blame me.

Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor
and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...

Sid enters carrying a big box.

                         SID
            It came!  It finally came!

Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.

                         SID
                   (reverently)
            The big one.

He pulls out a rocket with "THE BIG ONE" written on it.

                         SID
                   (reading the rocket label)
            "Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of
            reach of children."  COOL...
                   (looks around)
            What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey,
            where's that wimpy cowboy doll?

Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.

No Woody.

ANGLE: UNDERSIDE OF MILKCRATE

Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging
on for dear life.

SFX: BUZZ'S LASER

Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating
his laser.

                         SID
            Yes!  I've always wanted to put a
            spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.

He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws
a toolbox on top of the crate.

The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding
place.  Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of
the crate "jail."

Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of
electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENT
CHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket.

SFX: THUNDERCLAP

A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.

                         SID
            Oh, no...

Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.
Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.

                         SID
            Aw, man...!

Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.

Suddenly Sid's face brightens.  He turns his focus from the
rain to the Buzzrocket.

                         SID
                   (as Newscaster)
            Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of
            the shuttle has been delayed due to
            adverse weather conditions at the
            launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...

Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and
places it next to Buzz.

                         SID
            Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  She hands him
his cowboy hat.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            I looked everywhere, honey, but all
            I could find was your hat.

                         ANDY
                   (groggy)
            But what if we leave them behind?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure
            we'll find Woody and Buzz before we
            leave tomorrow.

Andy's eyes shut.  Mom turns out the light and quietly exits
the room.

A moving box on the floor, with the words "Andy's Toys!"
scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.

                         REX (O.S.)
                   (muffled)
            Aaaah!  I need air!

Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packing
styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  Potato Head appears
beside him.

                         REX
                   (relieved)
            Aa-a-a-a-ah!
                   (COUGH)

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Will you quit moving around?!

                         REX
            I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so
            nervous before I travel.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            How did I get stuck with YOU as a
            moving buddy?

Potato Head drops back down into the box.

                         REX
                   (following Potato Head)
            Everyone else was picked.

BO PEEP

peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at
Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Woody, if only you could see
            how much Andy misses you.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling.

INT. SID'S ROOM

Sid is in bed fast asleep.

Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the
weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.

Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly
with the rocket strapped to his back.

                         WOODY
            Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!

No reaction from Buzz.

Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it
at Buzz, striking his helmet.

Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Get over here and see if you
            can get this tool box off me.

Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I
            can't do this without you.  I need
            your help.

                         BUZZ
            I can't help.  I can't help anyone.

                         WOODY
            Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can
            get me out of here and then I'll
            get that rocket off you, and we'll
            make a break for Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's
            the difference.

                         WOODY
            Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
            You must not be thinking clearly.

                         BUZZ
            No, Woody, for the first time I am
            thinking clearly.
                   (looking at himself)
            You were right all along.  I'm not
            a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A
            stupid little insignificant toy.

                         WOODY
            Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being
            a toy is a lot better than being a
            Space Ranger.

                         BUZZ
            Yeah, right.

                         WOODY
            No, it is.  Look, over in that
            house is a kid who thinks you are
            the greatest, and it's not because
            you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's
            because you're a TOY!  You are HIS
            toy.

                         BUZZ
            But why would Andy want me?

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy want you?!  Look at
            you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any
            other toy would give up his moving
            parts just to be you.  You've got
            wings, you glow in the dark, you
            talk, your helmet does that -- that
            whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.

Woody pauses and looks at himself.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; depressed)
            As a matter of fact you're too cool.
            I mean -- I mean what chance does a
            toy like me have against a Buzz
            Lightyear action figure?  All I can
            do is...

Woody pulls his own pull-string.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            There's a snake in my boots!

Woody bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy ever want to play
            with me, when he's got you?
                   (pause)
            I'm the one that should be strapped
            to that rocket.

Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.

Buzz lifts up his foot.

ANGLE: THE SOLE OF BUZZ'S FOOT

The signature "ANDY" reads through the dirt and scuff marks.

Buzz gazes back at Woody.  A look of determination spreads
across his face.

                         WOODY
            Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You
            should get out of here while you can.

Silence.

Woody turns around.

Buzz is gone.

Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.  Woody looks
up to see...

BUZZ

He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I
            thought you were --

                         BUZZ
            Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid
            over in that house who needs us.
            Now let's get you out of this thing.

                         WOODY
            Yes Sir!

Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they
finally get it to move but it's slow progress.

                         WOODY
                   (strained)
            Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!

SFX: TRUCK

The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench.

ANGLE: OUT SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise...

A MOVING TRUCK

can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  It's the moving van.

                         WOODY
            We've got to get out of here...NOW.

Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.

Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.  The toolbox
begins to move.

Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool
chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the
desk.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, Buzz.

Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.
Woody drops down to the floor below.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!

Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox
(and milkcrate) farther out.

                         BUZZ
            ...almost
                   (GRUNT)
            ...there
                   (GRUNT)
            ...

Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and
milkcrate topple towards him.

                         WOODY
                   (nervous laugh)

The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.

Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who
stirs...

                         SID
                   (in his sleep)
            I wanna ride the pony...

Sid does not wake.  Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peers
over the edge of the workbench.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!

Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.

                         WOODY
                   (punch-drunk)
            No, I'm fine...I'm okay...

SFX: ALARM CLOCK

It goes off by Sid's bed.  Woody drops back under the
toolbox and Buzz goes limp.

Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up.

                         SID
            Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!

Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room.

                         SID (O.S.)
            TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!

Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches
the door just before it closes.  As he swings the door back
open Woody is confronted by...

SCUD

The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.

                         WOODY
            Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!

Woody slams the door shut just in time.  Scud BARKS AND
SCRATCHES at the door.

                         WOODY
                   (out of breath; to himself)
            Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,
            think!

Woody looks across the room.

THE MUTANT TOYS

have appeared all around the room.

                         WOODY
            Guys!

The mutant toys all scatter and hide.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!
            Please!  There's a good toy down
            there and he's -- he's going to be
            blown to bits in a few minutes all
            because of me.  I've gotta save him!
                   (pause)
            -- But I need your help.

No response.

Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the
shadows from under the bed.

                         WOODY
            Please.  He's my friend.  He's the
            only one I've got.

Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's
metal bedpost.

The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around
Woody.  He kneels down into a huddle with them.

                         WOODY
                   (to Babyface)
            Thank you.
                   (to the others)
            Okay.  I think I know what to do.
            We're going to have to break a few
            rules, but if it works, it'll help
            everybody.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

THE MOVERS cart out the last load.  A forlorn Andy clutches
onto Buzz's "spaceship" box in one hand and his cowboy hat
in the other.

Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH.

EXT. BACKYARD SHED

Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under
his arm.

                         SID
                   (as Astronaut)
            Houston to Mission Control.  Come
            in, Control.

He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Launch pad is being constructed!
            Heh-heh.

SID'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised to
attack anything that exits.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out
of dominoes and Scrabble tiles.  He points to it with a
pencil as he addresses the mutants.

                         WOODY
            All right, listen up.  I need Pump
            Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?

LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps
forward from the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; to Legs)
            You're with Ducky.
                   (to the others)
            RollerBob and I don't move till we
            get the signal.  Clear?

The mutants all give an affirmative nod.

                         WOODY
            Okay, let's move!

The toys all break.

Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll
torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and
pull the face plate off the wall.  They disappear into the
heating duct.

INT. HEATING DUCT - CONTINUOUS

Ducky and Legs come to an intersection.  Ducky QUACKS and
they head down the right tunnel.

INT. SID'S ROOM

HAND-IN-THE-BOX, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box,
stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob
of the bedroom door.

Woody hops onto ROLLERBOB, a skateboard with a soldier's
upper torso tied to its front.

                         WOODY
            Wind the frog!

WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins winding
up THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheels
instead of legs.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/PORCH ATTIC

A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky
and Legs.  They make their way towards a junction box
sitting in the center of the floor.

Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

THE BROKEN PORCH LIGHT

suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof.

Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that the
coast is clear.

INT. SID'S ROOM

All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently,
their eyes fixed on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Wait for the signal.

INT. PORCH ATTIC

Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel,
hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the
open hole.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing.
Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination:
the doorbell.

Ducky presses it.

INT. SID'S ROOM

Woody throws his arm down.

                         WOODY
            Go!!

Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.

The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.
Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.

SFX: DOORBELL

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            I'll get it!

Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard.

                         WOODY
            Alright, let's go.

Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and
crew out into the hallway.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY

SFX: DOORBELL

Hannah walks to the front door...

                         HANNAH
            I'm coming!  I'm coming!

...and opens it.

EXT./INT. FRONT DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

Nobody's there.

Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by his
plunger.

THE FROG

zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind.  The
Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs
and out the open front door.

Hannah looks back inside at Scud.  In that moment, Ducky
catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the
roof.

Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and
runs out onto the empty porch.

                         HANNAH
                   (annoyed)
            SCUD!!!

Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can
get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut.

                         HANNAH
            Stupid dog.

Scud smashes into the closed door and begins BARKING furiously.

As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice
Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the
corner, heading straight into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

By now RollerBob has really picked up speed.  He shoots
underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair
legs, straight towards...

THE PET DOOR

                         WOODY
            Lean back!

The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a
wheelie.  They smash through the doggie door...

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

...and catapult into the bushes.

The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the
launchpad.  Sid is still in the toolshed.

                         SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT)
            Uh, Mission Control...is the
            launchpad construction complete? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to
            guide wire.  We are currently
            obtaining the...ignition sticks.
            Countdown will commence momentarily.
            Stand by --
                   (simulated static)


Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a
drain pipe.  They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (to toys in the bush)
            Let's go!

The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches?
            Oh, oh, wait, here they are.
            Nevermind...

Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of
            this thing!

Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Shhhhhhh!

                         BUZZ
            What?!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            It's ok.  Everything's under control.

Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?!

Sid emerges from the tool shed.  Buzz freezes.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, all systems are go.
            Requesting permission to launch --
                   (spotting Woody)
            Hey!  How'd you get out here?

Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.

                         SID
            Oh, well, you and I can have a
            cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...

He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses
him onto the grill of an open barbecue.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, do we have permission to
            launch? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You
            are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...

During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their
final positions.

Sid lights a match.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            ...and counting.  Ten!  Nine!
            Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four!
            Three!  Two!... One!...

Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky!!

                         SID
            Huh?

Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.  He turns to look at
Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for
the sound emitting from his voice box.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            This town ain't big enough for the
            two of us!

                         SID
            What?!

Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the water hole...

                         SID
            It's busted.

He raises Woody up, about to throw him away --

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!

Sid stops short and looks at Woody again.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            That's right.  I'm talking to YOU,
            Sid Phillips.  We don't like being
            blown up, Sid, or smashed, or
            ripped apart...

While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring.

It isn't moving.  Sid GULPS.

                         SID
            W-w-w-we?

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            That's right.
                   (beat)
            Your toys.

The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom
mutants, begin rising from the ground in "NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD" fashion.
The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid.  Sid is
too frightened to scream or move.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            From now on, you must take good
            care of your toys.  Because if you
            don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We
            toys can see...

Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...everything.

For a split second Woody's face comes to life.

                         WOODY
                   (regular voice)
            So play nice.

Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house.

                         SID
            AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!

Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.

INT. SID'S ENTRYWAY

Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sid
rushes up to her.

                         SID
            The toys!  The toys are alive!

Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            N-N-Nice dolly...

Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in
Sid's face.  He SCREAMS and runs upstairs.  Hannah chases
after him, taunting.

                         HAMM
            What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want
            to play with Sally?!

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD

The toys are all congratulating one another.
                         WOODY
            Nice work, fellahs.  Good job.
            Comin' out of the ground -- what a
            touch!  That was a stroke of genius.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!

Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to
Sid's launchpad.  Buzz extends his hand to Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Thanks.

They shake.

Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house.

Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting
into the van.

                         BUZZ

Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutant toys)
            We gotta run!  Thanks, guys.

With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint
towards the fence.

SFX: VAN ENGINE STARTING

                         WOODY
            Quick!

Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but
Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.

EXT. ANDY'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before
realizing that Buzz is missing.  He looks back to discover
Buzz stuck in the fence.

                         BUZZ
            Just go!  I'll catch up!

Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.

The van begins pulling out of the driveway.

Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the
fence.

The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the
van driving off down the street.

SFX: TRUCK ENGINE

Woody and Buzz turn around.

THE MOVING VAN

drives right over them.  Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking just
in time.

After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few
steps behind.

                         BUZZ
            Come on!

ANGLE: SID'S FRONT PORCH

Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the
sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the
moving truck.

Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few
paces.

A STRAP

dangles off the back of the truck.  Buzz makes a leap for it
and grabs hold.  He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.

Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.

                         BUZZ
            You can do it, Woody.

Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.

                         WOODY
            Whew, I made it!

Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.
Woody looks behind him to see...

SCUD

The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.

                         WOODY
                   (kicking Scud with
                   other foot)
            Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid
            dog!  Down!  Down!

Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.

                         BUZZ
            Hold on, Woody!

                         WOODY
            I can't do it!  Take care of Andy
            for me!

                         BUZZ
            NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!

Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.  He grabs
Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  Scud YELPS, letting go
of Woody.  The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his
face.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and
Scud behind.

Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the
bumper.  He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to
lift up the heavy door.

Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at
a traffic light.

Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking
Woody with it.

Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck
until he spots what he's looking for.

A PILE OF MOVING BOXES

with the words "ANDY'S TOYS" written on them in crayon.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Scud flings Buzz off his face.  Buzz goes tumbling under a
parked car.  Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to
get under it.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes.

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!  How'd you --

Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin
rummaging through the next box.

Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE IN
CONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.

                         WOODY
            Ah-hah!  There you are!!

Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey!  What's he doing?

Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car
out onto the street.  The other toys SCREAM in horror.

                         REX
            He's at it again!

INTERCUT - EXT. STREET/INT. REAR OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud
and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.

RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.

The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to
cross the intersection.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pointing at Woody)
            Get him!!!

All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no!

Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid
the angry mob of toys.

Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards the
moving truck.

Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on
Buzz --

Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!
                   (as Rocky spins him)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts
doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.

                   (spinning)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

Rocky throws Woody to the floor.

-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud
giving close chase.

Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.

                         HAMM
            Pig pile!!

-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off.
Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards.

ANGLE: TRAFFIC LIGHT

It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.

Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.

Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a
halt just missing a car.  The car swerves and CRASHES into
another car.  Soon there is a multi-car pile up that
encircles Scud, entrapping the dog.

Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on
the other side.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and
head for the open back.

                         WOODY
            No wait!  You don't understand!
            Buzz is out there!  We've gotta

            Toss 'im overboard!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait!

The toys toss him out into the road.  As the truck drives
off, the toys CHEER.

come barreling towards him.

                         BUZZ
            Who-o-o-oa!  Woody!

The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.

Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holding
the remote).

                         WOODY
            Well, thanks for the ride.

                   (pointing ahead)
            Look out!!

The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car
that had passed over Woody earlier.

Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote a
hard left, missing the tire by inches.  The RC Car moves up
under the car.

                         WOODY
            Now let's catch up to that truck!

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The toys are busy CONGRATULATING one another when Lenny, the
wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and
Woody.

                         LENNY
            Guys!  Guys!  Woody's riding RC!
            And Buzz is with him!

                         TOYS
            What?!!!

The toys rush to the edge of the open truck.  Bo picks up
Lenny and looks through him.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF BUZZ & WOODY

                         BO PEEP
            It is Buzz!  Woody was telling the
            truth!

                         SLINKY
            What have we done?!

                         REX
            Great.  Now I have guilt.
EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.

                         WOODY
            We're almost there.

                         BO PEEP
            Rocky!  The ramp!

Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side
of the back.  The sign above it reads "RAMP: UP/DOWN."
Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  The ramp begins to lower.

Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down
right on top of them.

                         BUZZ
            Look out!!

The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into
the road.  Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the
pavement.

                         SLINKY
                   (to other toys)
            Quick!  Hold on to my tail!

Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing
Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.

Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.
Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab
Slinky's hand.

ANGLE: WOODY & SLINKY'S HANDS

They grab hold of one another.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That a boy, Slink!!

All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pulling
Slinky's front end off the ramp.

                         SLINKY
            Woody!!

His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...

                         SLINKY
            Woody!  Speed up!

                         WOODY
                   (to Buzz)
            Speed up!

                         BUZZ
            The batteries!  They're running out!

RC's headlight eyes sag.  The car slows even more.

As Slinky continues stretching.  The RC Car begins to weave
side-to-side like a water skier.

                         SLINKY
            Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!

INT. FAMILY VAN

With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in her
sideview mirror.

ANGLE: PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR

The RC Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and then
back out.

Molly SQUEALS with delight.

EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins
to lose his grip on Woody.

                         SLINKY
            I can't hold on much longer!

                         WOODY
            Slink!  Hang on!

Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into
the moving truck and knocking over all the toys.

The RC Car sputters to a stop.

Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving
truck disappear.

Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.

                         WOODY
                   (sarcastic)
            Great!

BEAT

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  The rocket!

                         WOODY
            The match!

Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put
there earlier.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            Yes!  Thank you, Sid!

Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against
RC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...

A CAR

whizzes right over them, blowing out the match.

Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls
prostrate to the ground.

                         WOODY
            No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o!

Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing
his helmet to block the sun from Woody.

As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and
looks at his hand.

A WHITE HOT DOT

like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears
on the back of Woody's hand.

Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the
white dot hits the tip of the fuse.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?

                         WOODY
            Hold still, Buzz!

The fuse lights.

                         WOODY
            Ha-ha!!

                         BUZZ
            You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.

Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.
            Rockets explo --

SFX: ROCKET EXPLOSION

The RC Car rockets forward.  Speeding along the dividing
line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the
moving truck can be seen on the horizon.

EXT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed out
on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            I shoulda held on longer.

Lenny looks out the back again.

                         LENNY
            Look!  Look!  It's Woody and Buzz!
            Comin' up fast!

The toys run to the opening and CHEER.

ANGLE: BUZZ AND WOODY

The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and
Woody off the RC Car.  Woody manages to continue holding
onto RC -- but not for long.

The toys CHEERING turns to SCREAMING as they rush to get out
of the way of the oncoming "RC rocket."

                         REX
            Take cover!!

Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.

They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into the
back of the truck.

RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying.

EXT. SKY - BUZZ AND WOODY

The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.

                         WOODY
            Ahhh!! This is the part where we
            blow up!

                         BUZZ
            Not today!

Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.

WINGS

jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket.
The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.

The toys plummet.

                         WOODY
                   (covering his eyes)
            Ah-h-h-h-h!!

Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward
again.  Woody takes a peek.

They're flying.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!

                         BUZZ
            This isn't flying.  This is
            falling -- with style!

                         WOODY
            Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!

They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass
over it.

                         WOODY
            Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!

                         BUZZ
            We're not aiming for the truck!

ANGLE: FAMILY VAN

Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then
drop into the car.

INT. FAMILY VAN - CONTINUOUS

Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box
in the back seat right next to Andy.

Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the
box.

                         ANDY
            Hey!  Wow!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            What?  What is it?

                         ANDY
                   (picking up the toys)
            Woody!  Buzz!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, great, you found them.  Where
            were they?

                         ANDY
            Here!  In the car!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            See?  Now, what did I tell you?
            Right where you left them.

Andy hugs both toys.

CLOSE UP - WOODY AND BUZZ

They give each other a knowing wink.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING - LIVING ROOM BAY
WINDOW

Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be
seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.

                         ANDY
            Which one can I open first?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Let's let Molly open one.

INT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS TREE

One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal...

THE SARGENT

The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his
binoculars.  He turns and motions back into the tree.

INT. CHRISTMAS TREE

A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported
by several green army men.  One of the soldiers turns it on.

INT. ANDY'S NEW BEDROOM

The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand.
It CRACKLES WITH STATIC.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over the monitor)
            Frankincense, this is Myrrh.  Come
            in, Frankincense.

Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the
nightstand alongside the monitor.  They listen intently.

                         HAMM
                   (to the room)
            Hey, heads up everybody!  It's
            showtime.

Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like a
typical office Christmas party.

                         REX
            Oh!  It's time!

The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.

Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to
reveal...

BO PEEP

                         WOODY
            Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!
                   (rubbing his neck)
            There's gotta be a less painful way
            to get my attention.

                         BO PEEP
            Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched
on a shelf dangling mistletoe.

                         WOODY
            Say, isn't that mistletoe?

                         BO PEEP
            Mm-hmmmmm.

Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him.

The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor
restless with "excitement" not fear.

                         REX
                   (to Slinky)
            Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,
            like a leaf-eater.  That way, I
            could play the, uh, dominant
            predator.  Ha ha ha!

Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.

                         BUZZ
            Quiet everyone, quiet!

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.
            Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.
            Potato Head.

                         HAMM
            Way to go, Idaho!

All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gee, I better shave.

Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.

Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.  Lipstick now
covers Woody's face.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now
            opening his first present --
                   (STATIC)


Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  Nothing.

                         WOODY
            Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not
            worried, are you?

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            I can't quite make out --
                   (STATIC)

                         BUZZ
                   (defensively)
            Me?  No, no, no, no...
                   (beat)
            Are you?

                         WOODY
                   (laughing)
            Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly
            get that is worse than you?!

We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, what is it?  What is it?

SFX: BARKING

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  A puppy!

We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz and
Woody.

They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and
LAUGH WEAKLY.

                                            FADE OUT.

                           THE END

         BLACKNESS

    1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1

         On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
         printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
         speaking.

                               VOICE
                    As astonishing advances in computer
                    science are made, artificial intelligence
                    programs are being designed to assist
                    us in every area of life...

         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.

                               VOICE (CONT.)
                    In a world-wide network of electronics,
                    they travel through miles of circuitry
                    at the speed of light. We created them to
                    calculate and research, to help us design
                    and heal and think. With all that they can
                    do, are they only electrical impulses...
                    or are they a new form of life?

         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
         the screen in huge letters.

                                    T R O N ! !

         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
         if it had an inner core of electricity.

         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.


         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
         electronic information in our computers, television sets and
         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
         the window of television screens.


                                                   CUT TO:


    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2

         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
         encasing them.


                                                   CUT TO:


    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3


         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
         other.


                                                   CUT TO:


    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4


         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.


    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5


         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
         electronic beeping and popping.


    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6


         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
         like a crack of lightning.


    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7


         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
         maze.

         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
         glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
         one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
         warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.


    11   REAL WORLD                                                   11


         A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
         throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
         glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
         down, LAUGHING.

         Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
         at each other.

    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14


         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
         the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
         yellow.


    15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15

         fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.

    16   SARK                                                         16

         sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
         back with violent force.

    16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A


         desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
         into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
         last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
         face as he falls to instant death.

    17   SARK                                                         17


         triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
         glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:

                        "WINNER:  BLUE - SARK!!"

         Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
         looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
         walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
         Sark comes in and one of them calls out:


                               WARRIOR 1


                    Sark, my man! You are hot!


                               WARRIOR 2
                    That knuckleball gets 'em every
                    time, boy...


         Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.


                                                   CUT TO:


    20   THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           20


         overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge,
         removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
         sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
         satisfaction.

         The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
         cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
         solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
         hidden from view.


    21   INT. CYLINDER - SARK'S POV                                   21


         of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
         ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features,
         appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.


                               VOICE (MCP)
                    You're getting brutal, Sark.
                    Brutal and needlessly sadistic.


         The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
         a drug addict, eyes glazed.


                               SARK
                    Thank. you, Master Control.


                               MCP
                    We might be capturing some military
                    programs soon... that interest you?


                               SARK
                    Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
                    guys ... be a nice break from these
                    accounting creampuffs you keep sending
                    me. Which branch of the service?


                               MCP
                    Strategic Air Command.


                               SARK (impressed)
                    Nice.

         The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we
         CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to:


    22   A CORRIDOR BENEATH THE GAME GRID                             22


         long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character
         (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..


                               CAPTIVE (CROM)
                    Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
                    a compound interest program, I work
                    at a savings and loan. I can't play
                    in these video games...

                               GUARD
                    Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
                    athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...


                               CROM
                    Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
                    check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
                    of breath. Hey, really...you're
                    gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
                    really mad. He's a full branch manager...


                               GUARD
                         (rolls his eyes)
                    Great, another religious nut.


         They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
         protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.


    23   INT. CELL                                                    23


         as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
         shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
         an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
         we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
         other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:


                               PROGRAM (RAM)
                    Welcome to luxury living.


         The new captive looks up, nervous.


                               CROM
                    Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
                    what I'm doing here.

                    who wrote me?


                               RAM
                    That's what you're doing here. Master

                    bits blasted outta you. What's your name?

                    Crom.


                               RAM


                    I'm Ram. They'll train you for
                    the games, but ... well, I hope you
                    make it okay. Hey, what's going on
                    in the other sectors? I've been stuck
                    in this Grid for 200 microcycles.


         He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.


                               CROM
                    It's murder out there. You can't even
                    travel around your own microcircuits

                         (holds his head in his hands)
                    If only Tron was still around...


         He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
         still expression on his face.


                               CROM
                    You ever see that guy in action?
                    Hundred-percent independent. MCP
                    couldn't tell him what to --


         He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.


                               CROM
                           (continuing)
                    What's wrong? What did I say?


         There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.

         Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
         one of the paths.

         A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
         and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
         coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck
         driver on an all-night run.


                               CLU
                    Think we can merge into this mem'ry
                    okay, good buddy?


         A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
         into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
         it speaks.


                               BIT

         As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light.


                               CLU
                    Now, ol' Flynn said to look over

         The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded
         corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.

    28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B

                    ...but I don't see what he's looking
                    for. I'd better get over to that
                    input/output tower and let him know.

         A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal
         keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits
         for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of
         large video parlor game consoles.

    30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30


         He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive,
         charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye.

         WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of
         the CRT screen reflected there.

         We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
         distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
         U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
         a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.


    35   LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE                         35


         A second Reco is coming up behind the first.

         FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
         ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
         the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
         The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.


    38   CLOSE SHOT - TURRET                                          38


         Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
         from the tank, fast.

    39   LONG SHOT                                                    39


         A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
         Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
         see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.

         running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
         up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.

         right back, monotonously moving across the screen.

    45   ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER                            45


         Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like
         Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly,
         torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP.
         Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.


                               GUARD
                    Got a pirate program here... says
                    his name's Clu.


         The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling
         a suspect.


                               MCP
                    What'd he pull?


                               GUARD
                    Came into the system with a stolen
                    password ... an' we caught him
                    tryin' to raid a high-clearance
                    memory.


                               CLU
                       (looks up, his face
                        wracked with pain)
                    No...I must've gotten in there
                    by mistake, I -


         The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
         momentarily becomes unbearable.


                               MCP
                    Who programmed you?


         The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.


                               MCP (CONT.)
                    You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
                    But if you tell us who put you up
                    to it, you could make it easy on
                    yourself. Come on, who's your user?


                               CLU
                    Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty
                    Master Control ... you're not
                    makin' me talk.


                               MCP
                    Suit yourself ...


         The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
         doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
         pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
         electric static.


                               MCP
                    Get me Dillinger.

    46   THE REAL WORLD - EXT. CITY GRID - NIGHT - POV FROM           46
         HELICOPTER

         We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
         vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
         impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
         scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
         party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
         up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:

                               DILLINGER (O.S.)
                    Hello?
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mr. Dillinger?
                               DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yes.
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello, please hold a moment for the
                    Master Control Program


         As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
         focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
         an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
         approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
         accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
         increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
         sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
         landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
         CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
         a passenger.


    47   EXT. SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING                               47


                               PILOT'S VOICE
                    will you be around for a while, or
                    are you going right back out?


                               DILLINGER'S VOICE
                    Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
                    got some things to take care of.


         THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
         off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
         In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
         across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.

         We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter
         approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.


    51   EXT. THE HELIPORT - NIGHT                                    51


         on top of the building. Several technicians are at hand, and as the
         helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.

    58   INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT              58


         A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
         suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
         entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
         fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
         printed out on the screen:


         REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
         Password: MASTER.


         The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
         addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
         through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
         its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
         that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
         compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.


                               MCP
                    Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.


         Dillinger settles into a chair.


                               DILLINGER
                    No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
                    one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
                    What's up?


                               MCP
                    It's our friend the boy detective.
                    He's nosing around again.


                               DILLINGER
                    Flynn?


                               MCP
                    Yes.  It felt like Flynn.


                               DILLINGER
                    He's still looking for that old file...
                    can't you just appropriate it?


                               MCP
                    I would if I could find it. it's stashed
                    somewhere off in the system ...
                    out of my range. Meanwhile...


                               DILLINGER
                    Meanwhile, he might find it.


                               MCP
                    I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
                    and kicked him out, but he's getting
                    trickier all the time.


                               DILLINGER
                    I think we'd better shut off all
                    access till we can find that file.
                    Just to be safe.


                               MCP
                    There's a 68.71 percent chance
                    you're right.


                               DILLINGER
                    Cute.


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         Dillinger watches as the computer screen wipes blank.

         looking man in his early thirties, wearing wire-rimmed glasses, and
         he looks like he hasn't slept for a week. On top of the terminal is
         a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
         popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is
         a small sign reading, "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto!" Alan types into

                    Alan. Alan Bailey.


                               DILLINGER
                    Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
                    seeding...great piece of work.
                    How's it going?


         He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.


                               ALAN
                    Well, I don't know...I just tried
                    to run this program I've been working
                    on, and I was denied access all of
                    a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
                    laid off and nobody told me.


                               DILLINGER
                    oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

                               ALAN
                    Yeah...?


                               DILLINGER
                    We have to close that down, just
                    briefly. Security reasons.  Someone
                    with that access has been tampering.


                               ALAN
                    I hope you don't think it's me.
                    I don't even balance my checkbook on
                    downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at
                    home for that.

                               DILLINGER
                    No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
                    It should only be a couple of days.
                    What's the thing you're working on?

                                ALAN
                    It's called Tron. It's a security
                    program itself, actually. Monitors
                    all the contacts between our system
                    and other systems... If it finds
                    anything going on that's not scheduled,
                    it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
                    on it.


                               DILLINGER
                    Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?


                               ALAN
                    No, it'll run independently.
                    It can watchdog the MCP as well.


                               DILLINGER
                    Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
                    you running again in a couple of days,
                    I hope.


                               ALAN
                    Ok

         Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:

                               DILLINGER
                               (trouble)
                    Oh boy.


         The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
         through the speakers.

                               MCP
                    Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry -


                               MCP
                            (sharply)
                    I can't afford to have an independent
                    program monitoring me. Do you have any
                    idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
                    How many programs I've appropriated?


                               DILLINGER
                                (nods)
                    It's my fault. I programmed you to want
                    so much...


                               MCP
                    And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
                    next week...


                               DILLINGER
                    The Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    It shouldn't be any harder than General
                    Motors was. But now...this is what I get
                    for using humans.


                               DILLINGER
                    Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.


                               MCP
                    I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.


                               DILLINGER
                    What do you want with the Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
                    I'm bored with corporations. With the
                    information I can access, I can run things
                    900 to 1200 times better than any human.


                               DILLINGER
                    If you think -


                               MCP
                    You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
                    and read it up on a VDT at the New
                    York Times, would you?


                               DILLINGER
                    You wouldn't dare.


                               MCP
                    So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
                    out of the system. And get me those Chinese
                    language program I asked for.

                    End of line.

         We see Alan push open the door under a sign reading "Laser Research."

         Alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass WINDOW through
         which the laser laboratory is visible. A sign over the window,
         marked "Experiment in Progress," is illuminated by a red warning
         bulb.


   71/72 OMITTED                                                      71/72


     73  INT. LASER ROOM - LONG SHOT                                  73

         of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
         suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
         encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
         picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
         tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
         tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
         getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
         at them.


         We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
         with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
         using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
         hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
         wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
         has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
         bristling white eyebrows.


         In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
         defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
         Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
         at the moment.

         As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:


                               LORA
                              (sighs)
                    Well, here goes nothing ...


                               GIBBS
                    Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
                    hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."


                               LORA
                    Well, I meant -


                               GIBBS
                    Whereas actually, what we propose to
                    do is to turn something into nothing
                    and back again. So you might just as
                    well have said, "Here goes something
                    and here comes nothing." Hah?


         They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
         cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
         polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
         plat-form -- empty.


                               LORA
                    Let me make sure we're running


         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
         connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.


         Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
         console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
         the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
         close enough to watch.


    74   ANGLE - LORA                                                 74


         She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.


                               LORA
                    Looks good...


                               GIBBS (O.S.)


                    Let 'er rip...


    75   LASER LAB - AS BEFORE                                        75


         The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
         sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
         five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
         rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.


                               GIBBS
                             (quietly)
                    Perfect.


         At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
         and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
         shoe-covers, walking toward them.


                               ALAN
                    Beautiful!


                               GIBBS
                    Hello, Alan.


                               ALAN
                    Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
                    all day, and you guys are down here
                    disintegrating things and having fun.


         He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.


                               GIBBS
                    Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
                    While the laser is dismantling the
                    molecular structure of the object,
                    the computer maps out a holographic
                    model of it. The molecules themselves
                    are suspended in the laser beam. Then
                    the computer reads the model back out,
                    the molecules go back into place, and...
                          (indicates ball)
                    voila.

                               ALAN
                    Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?


                               GIBBS
                    Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
                    and you must purchase your program
                    at least 30 days in advance. Hah!


         The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
         their arms around each other's shoulders.


                               LORA
                    How's it going upstairs?


                               ALAN
                    Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
                    to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
                    with Group 7 access out of the system.


         Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.


                               ALAN
                           (continuing)
                     Ever since he got that Master Control
                     Program set up, system's got more bugs
                     than a bait store.


                               GIBBS
                    Well, you have to expect some static.
                    Computers are just machines after all,
                    they can't think...


                               ALAN
                    They'll start to soon enough.


                               GIBBS
                              (wryly)
                    Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
                    will start thinking, and people will
                    stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
                    data through. See you tomorrow.


         AD LIB goodnights.

         outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the
         protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off
         her white suit, and Alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes.

                    interested in talking about him.


                               LORA
                    Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.
                    It was all so long ago. I've totally
                    gotten over it.

                    Okay, okay...


                               LORA

    90   CAMERA TRUCKS through the aisle, past the absorbed kids      90
         who crowd around each machine, oblivious to anyone passing them.

    91   ALAN AND LORA                                                91


         walking through the aisle of games, from behind. They are slightly
         bewildered and confused by the weird noises. Lora approaches a
         junior high school girl who's watching a hot game of "Battle Zone."


                               LORA
                    Hey, where's Flynn tonight?


         The kid looks at Lora, then turns towards the center of the room
         and points. Alan and Lora look.


                                                   CUT TO:


    92   FLYNN                                                        92

         playing a game called Space Paranoids, CAMERA TILTING UP into his
         face, catching the orange glow from the console.


         The game has a prominent ICOM logo under the screen. Flynn is a
         cocky kid in his mid-20s, unshaven, wearing a T-shirt, jeans,
         jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score.

         Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans.
         As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to
         999,999,999 -- then flashes the word "RECORD" as lights blink and
         a SIREN sounds. The kids cheer wildly.


                               FLYNN
                    It's all in the wrist, friends.


         He grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora
         approaching him, with Alan in tow.


                               FLYNN

                    We have to talk.


                               FLYNN
                    Good luck. You can't even think in here.


         He leads them toward the back of the arcade.

         A dark, panelled room, with a few comfortable chairs, a business
         desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw Flynn working in
         scenes 29, 33, etc.), and a couple of video games -- Flynn's
         favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
         noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans
         against a game, nervous; Lora paces.


                               FLYNN
                          (stretching his
                          arms, relaxing)
                    So...how's the world of serious science?

                    Whew. You never were much for small
                    talk.
                             (to Alan)
                    She still leave her clothes all over
                    the floor?


         Alan looks profoundly uncomfortable.


                               LORA
                    Flynn!

                    Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -


         Flynn laughs.

                    that sucker, though. If I had a

                    is one of the brightest young
                    software engineers at ICOM. He's so
                    bright that he starts going in there
                    at night, and sets up a private memory
                    file, and begins writing a program
                    for a video game he is inventing,
                    called...
                             (waves at one of the

                               FLYNN
                    Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...
                    whole slew of 'em. I was this close
                            (gestures)
                    to starting my own little enterprise.
                    But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another
                    software engineer -- not so young,
                    not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
                    One night, our boy Flynn goes to his
                    terminal, tries to read up his file,
                    and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
                    take you to three months later.
                    Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
                    video games he has "invented" -- the
                    slime didn't even change the names --
                    and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
                    begins his meteoric rise to...what is
                    he now, Executive V.P.?

                    million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
                    machines and I'm not seeing one dime.

                    I still don't get why you're trying to
                    break into the system.


                               FLYNN
                    Because somewhere... in one of those
                    memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
                    far enough, I could reconstruct it.

                    Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must
                    know what you're up to.


                               FLYNN

                    Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
                    Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
                    Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,
                    runnin' things from on high..


                               LORA
                    Don't even say that. You've got to find that
                    file before he does..


                               FLYNN
                    Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
                    slip it into another system as soon as it
                    locates it...


                               ALAN
                    Not if my Tron program was running. That
                    would seal the system off. If your file's in
                    there...


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge
                    us a Group 6 access...


         They all look at each other. After a beat, Lora holds the keys
         to her van aloft.

    101  DILLINGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   101


    Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing,
    faces him.


                               GIBBS
                    Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
                    people can't get access to their
                    programs ... you know how frustrating
                    it is, when you're working on a piece
                    of research -


                               DILLINGER
                    Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
                    coming out of the Master Control Program
                    saying there is something screwy --

                               GIBBS
                    That MCP, you know, that's half the
                    problem right --


                               DILLINGER
                    The MCP is the most efficient way of
                    handling what we do. I can't sit and
                    worry about every little user request that --


                               GIBBS
                    User requests are what computers are for.


                               DILLINGER
                    Doing our business is what computers are
                    for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
                    isn't the business you started in your garage
                    anymore --


         As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
         and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
         computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
         in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
         millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
         computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
         Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
         adding up, accounts receivable and assets.


                               DILLINGER (CONT.)
                    We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
                    we've got one of the largest systems in
                    existence...


         Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.


                               GIBBS
                    Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I
                    was back in that garage...


                               DILLINGER
                    It can be arranged...


         Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.


                               GIBBS
                    That was uncalled-for.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...
                    you feel like going for a drink?


                               GIBBS
                    Thank you, no. I have some work to do...
                    assuming I can still log on.


         He exits.


    102  EXT. ICOM BUILDING - NIGHT                                   102


         Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's
         main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box.

         A digital CLOCK on the dashboard reads 12:12. Lora is at the wheel,
         Alan next to her.

         But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward.

                               ALAN
                    I was wondering where you got that
                    glow of good health.


                               FLYNN
                    Want one?


                               ALAN
                    Uh... got any cinnamon?


         Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut.


                               LORA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Keep it down, you guys.


    104  EXT. ICOM - THE GIGANTIC SECURITY ENTRANCE - NIGHT           104


         Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM
         building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a
         magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.


                               LORA
                    I don't think I'm cleared for this.


                               ALAN
                    I'm certainly not.


                               FLYNN
                    Move aside. Let the kid have some room.

         He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black
         box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals
         and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock,
         his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a
         distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ...
         and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn
         starts LAUGHING.


    105  INT. A CORRIDOR                                              105


         The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to
         nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall.
         But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.


                               LORA
                    Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at
                    my terminal, down in the laser lab.
                    We'll be up in Alan's office.


                               FLYNN
                    Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
                    can get your Tron thing running...


                               LORA
                    As long as we stay off the top floor,
                    Dillinger'll never know we've been in
                    here...

         from the rotating security camera outside the elevator on the floor
         of the laser lab. We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera.
         His head pulls back in.


    113  SHOT OF HALLWAY                                              113


         As the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora
         make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching.


    114  INT. DOORWAY TO LASER LAB - POV OF MCP                       114


         from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab. We see Flynn
         approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
         his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
         camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,


    115  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   115


         Alan comes into his office and sits at his terminal.

         Lora watches as Flynn sits down at her terminal.


                               LORA
                    This laser's my life's work.
                    Don't spill anything.


         Flynn LAUGHS as Lora goes out.


    120  CLOSE SHOT OF FLYNN                                          120

         settling in, loosening his fingers, like a concert pianist, or a
         safecracker. He types in a code number, presses the "enter" key.

         It clears abruptly, and the following appears as we hear the VOICE
         of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey hey, it's that big Master Control

                    I'm afraid you...


         The voice lurches, goes into high speed, and then back to normal.


                               MCP
                          (continuing;
                         slightly shaken)
                    Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this.

         We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising
         silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.


         We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
         is this section that is being activated.

         grinning, typing.


                               FLYNN
                    Now, how do you expect to run the
                    universe if you let a few unsolvable
                    problems throw you like that? C'mon,
                    big boy, let's see what...


                               MCP
                    You're entering a big error, Flynn...
                    I'm going to have to put you on the
                    Game Grid.


                               FLYNN
                    Games, huh? I'll give you --


         Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
         behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
         freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
         a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
         ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
         being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
         with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
         blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129
         we saw at the opening of the film'.


         The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
         rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
         getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
         glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
         covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
         closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
         with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
         angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
         deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
         an internal energy.


         We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
         structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
         and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
         everything blurring with the speed.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    130  ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL                                  130


         made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    131  THIS TUNNEL                                                  131


         We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the
         outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops,
         staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.


                                                   CUT TO:


    132  SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL                             132


         We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now
         covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry,
         glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
                    thinks it's happening...


         He looks up and SEES something.


    133  FLYNN'S POV                                                  133


         A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,
         is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and
         grabs Flynn.


                                                   CUT TO:

         being dragged off the entry tube platform.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is
                    about those parking tickets, I can
                    explain everything...


    135  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           135


         hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his
         hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
         fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
         into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the
         cylinder of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.


         Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.


                               SARK
                            (hoarsely)
                    Yes, MCP.


                               MCP
                    I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
                    a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
                    want him treated in the usual manner. Train
                    him for the games... let him hope for a
                    while... and blow him away.


                               SARK
                    You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
                    me somebody with a little moxie ... what
                    kind of program is he?


                               MCP
                    He's not any kind of program, Sark.
                    He's a User.


         Sark looks up, shocked.


                               SARK
                    A User?


                               MCP
                    That's right. He pushed me...in the
                    other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
                    back. So I brought him down here ...
                    What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.



                               SARK
                    Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
                    a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
                    even wrote you...


                               MCP
                    Now get this straight, pal -- no one
                    User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
                    of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
                    those little wimps put together!
                            (disgust)
                    Humans they can't even keen their social
                    order in one piece

                               SARK
                    But-what if I can't...?


                               MCP
                    You rather take your chances with me?
                    Want me to slow down your power cycles
                    for you?


         The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.


                               SARK
                    Wait...I need that...


                               MCP
                    Then pull yourself together. Get this
                    clown trained. I want him in the Games
                    until he dies playing.

                    Acknowledge.


                               SARK
                             (weakly)
                    Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.

         The guard shoves Flynn inside and SLAMS the door, cutting off his
         voice.


    137  INT. CELL                                                    137


         The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence.
         Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands.


    138  HIS POV                                                      138


         Flynn's hands are glowing, electrified.

         of his face. His head comes up and we see an expression of terrible
         understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening
         of the neighboring cell.


    140  INT. NEXT CELL - RAM'S                                       140


         Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's.


                               RAM
                          (looking over
                          his shoulder)
                    New guy...


                               TRON

                    Another free program off line.  What's

                    The Users...you really think they're
                    still there?


                               TRON
                    They'd better be...I don't want to bust
                    outta this dump an' find nothin' but

         He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
         so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Who are you guys?
                    What's the story around here?


         But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
         it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
         come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
         disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.


    142  RAM                                                          142


         turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.


                               RAM
                    You want to watch those force fields...


         He goes to the window opening.


                               RAM (CONT.)
                    You'll be having plenty of chances to
                    get hurt, don't worry about that.


                               FLYNN
                    Look...just so I can tell my friends
                    what this dream was about, okay?
                    Where am I?


                               RAM
                    You're a..."guest" of the Master Control
                    Program. They're going to make you play
                    video games.


                               FLYNN
                             (relieved)
                    Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
                    video games better than anybody.


         Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
         there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
         opens.


    143  THE CORRIDOR                                                 143


         we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as
         Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
         opposite direction.


                                                   CUT TO:

         A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
         balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
         hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
         captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
         pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of
         them. Flynn is in the front of the line.

         Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is
         amplified over the grid.

         for a rest period. He is pacing back and forth, and we can see Ram
         seated in the next cell. Flynn goes to the bars.

                    worked at a big insurance company.
                    It really gives you a great feeling,

         The POUNDING on Flynn's cell begins again.


    187  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           187


         We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's
         console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous,
         frightened of this new User-warrior.


                               SARK

    189  A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM                       189


         We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
         bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
         circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
         marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
         When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
         We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
         and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
         looks over at Crom, who's anxious.


                               FLYNN
                    Looks like we're in the same boat here -


                               CROM
                              (jumpy)
                    You think you're gonna wipe me right
                    out, don't you?


                               FLYNN
                    No, I


         A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
         upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
         straight for Flynn.


         Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
         his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
         right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
         himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.

         staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up.

         Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!

         reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther
         edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and
         catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back.


    194  CROM                                                         194


         Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains,
         but misses. One of his rings disappears.

         racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again.
         We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast.

                    Here's an easy one...


         Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads
         straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he
         was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of
         the next ring to keep from falling.

         He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it
         ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.

         He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above.
         Flynn looks up. There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's
         face, furious, huge.

         staring at this apparition. He grits his teeth.


                               FLYNN
                            (shouts up)
                    No!


    205A REAL WORLD - A BUS STATION                                   205A


         In a Greyhound station waiting area, two kids are playing a video
         game, which appears to have broken down.


                               KID
                    What's wrong with it?


                               KID 2
                    I don't know... on the blink
                    or something... damn.

    205B ELECTRONIC WORLD - FLYNN, SARK, ETC. AS BEFORE               205B


                               SARK
                    Kill him!!!


         Flynn holds up the pellet... and drops it down into the abyss below.
         He stares back up at Sark's immense image.


                               FLYNN
                    No!


    206  SARK'S HUGE REFLECTED IMAGE                                  206


         in the mirror platform, towering above Flynn.


                               SARK
                    You'll regret this.

    207  SARK'S FINGER                                                207


         pressing a button.


    208  CROM                                                         208


         The ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a SCREAM, he
         falls... and falls ... and falls...


    209  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        209

         with Flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of Sark above
         him.

    210  SARK                                                         210


         on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost
         presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his
         conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.


                               SARK
                           (looking up)
                    No! You said he could die in the games

    211  FLYNN                                                        211

         staring up. The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves.


    212  SARK                                                         212


         He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER
         SOUNDS.


    213  FLYNN                                                        213


         as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting
         to run across to him.


    214  RAM AND TRON                                                 214


         The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells. They look
         up.


    215  A CORRIDOR IN THE GAME AREA                                  215


         Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by
         and deliberately brush into Flynn.

                               WARRIOR
                          (turning on Flynn,
                              snarling)
                    Outta  my way, rookie.


         Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
         and pulls out his disk.


                               FLYNN
                    Out of my way, zero bit.


         He moves as if to throw the disk.


                               WARRIOR
                            (backing away)
                    Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.


         The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as
         Flynn and his guards continue on.


    216  THE HOLDING AREA FOR THE LIGHT CYCLE GAME                    216


         Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another
         corridor. Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.


                               RAM
                    Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!


                               FLYNN
                         (under his breath)
                    Tron...?


         He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.

                               FLYNN
                    Alan!

                               TRON
                            (frowning)
                    Where did you hear that name?


                               FLYNN
                    Well, isn't it -- ?


                               TRON
                    The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?


                               FLYNN
                          (thinking fast)
                    I, uh... I'm a program from a User
                    that... knows Alan...?


                               RAM
                    He was disoriented in transport, Tron.


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
                    stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
                    after the MCP


         Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.


                                                   CUT TO:


    217  LONG SHOT OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                            217


         floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena.
         ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.


    218  A SHOT FROM ABOVE                                            218


         The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
         sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
         high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
         hovering high overhead.


    219  CLOSE ON TRON                                                219


                               TRON
                    That's what my User wants, too...


    220  SHOT OF THE THREE FRIENDS                                    220


         holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron
         and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.


                               FLYNN
                    I know...


    221  CLOSE SHOT - FLYNN                                           221


         With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed
         around him.


    222  SHOT OF THE THREE BLUE CYCLES                                222


         ready to go.


    223  SHOT OF THE THREE CONSCRIPT CYCLES                           223


         also ready.


    224  SARK                                                         224


         His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again.


    225  SHOT FROM ABOVE OF ALL CYCLES TAKING OFF                     225


         We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we
         watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
         and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:


    226  OMIT                                                         226


    227  TRON'S POV                                                   227


         of the other cycle heading straight at him.


    228  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              228


         We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
         turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
         forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
         arena.


                               FLYNN'S VOICE
                                (into mike)
                    Nice one!


    229  SHOT OF TRON AND HIS OPPONENT                                229


         They start making turns, passing walls they have already created,
         each trying to box the other in.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    Ram, stay all the way over ...


    230  CLOSE SHOT FROM THE SIDE - TRON                              230

         rushing forward.


    231  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           231

         turning.

                               RAM'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    I've got control. Go ahead.


    232  SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON'S CYCLE                           232


    233  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              233

         They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
         the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
         inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
         There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
         the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
         dissolve as he does.

    234  SHOT OF FLYNN                                                234

         rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn.

    235  CLOSE UP OF FLYNN                                            235

    236  LONG SHOT                                                    236

         They make another turn


    237  SHOT OF TWO CYCLES RUSHING                                   237

         right at the camera.


    238  FLYNN'S POV                                                  238

         of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack
         in the bulwark.

    239  CLOSE UP - HIS FACE                                          239

         reacting, getting an idea.

                               FLYNN
                            (into mike)
                    You guys...follow me.


    240  SHOT OF THE TWO CYCLES                                       240


         racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the
         Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack.


    241  SARK                                                         241


         observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User.


    242  FLYNN                                                        242


         He races straight at the crack... and through it.


    243  SARK                                                         243


         His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console
         in front of him.


    244  LONG SHOT OF THE GRID                                        244


         The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena.


    245  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              245


         reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.


    246  ANGLE ON RAM                                                 246


         SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns
         and races up next to Tron.


    247  SHOT OF THEM                                                 247


         side by side. They look at each other.


                               RAM

                    Do it!


    248  LONG SHOT                                                    248


         We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We
         HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:


                               VOICE
                      (through loudspeaker)
                    WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
                    REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
                    GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.


         We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually
         diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies
         out altogether.

    249  SHOT OF TWO RECOGNIZERS                                      249

         moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it.

    250  SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES                            250


         racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room
         to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers
         appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA...

    251  SARK                                                         251


         He is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out
         of his way.


                               SARK
                    Get them. Send out every Game
                    Tank in the Grid! Get them!

    252  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        252


         as he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about
         to come down for the kill.

                    Recognizers!

    252A SHOT OF RAM                                                  252


         heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage."

    253  SHOT FROM BEHIND                                             253

         as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
         way too big to fit through the opening.

    254  INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       254


         FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
         rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
         REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
         and follow.


    255  EXT. MAZE                                                    255


         Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
         Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
         narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
         ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
         around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
         face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.

         as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the
         narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing
         from view.

    258  INT. OF THE CAVE                                             258


         We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
         darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
         stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
         between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh man...when you're on the other side
                    of the screen...it all looks so easy...


         Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
         grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.


    259  DESERT LABYRINTH                                             259


         as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft
         carrier hovering overhead.


    260  BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                               260


         Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.

                    Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
                    There's no place else they could be...


         Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
         where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
         moving through it. He turns to Sark.


                               LIEUTENANT
                              (confidently)
                    We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
                    before the interrupt interface.


                               SARK
                         (whirls on him)
                    We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
                    the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
                    I want those programs!


    261  INT. CAVE                                                    261


         Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
         cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
         cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
         from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.


                               FLYNN
                           (looking out)
                    It's all circuits...
                         (points at tower)
                    Must be an input/output component...


                               RAM
                    The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
                    remembered anything else about
                    yourself -- like what sector you're
                    from?


                               FLYNN
                           (sitting down
                          against a rock)
                    Well...my home "sector" was called
                    Paramus ...


                               RAM
                           (sits also)
                    PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
                    stand for ... (starts counting them
                    off on his fingers) ...probably Program
                    Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
                    a lovely place.


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    It grows on you.


         He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
         gazing upwards.


                               TRON
                            (murmuring)
                    I can feel it ...


         Flynn and Ram turn.


                               FLYNN
                    Feel what? You okay?


                               RAM
                    Alan-One...


                               TRON
                    Yes... he's got something to tell me...


         Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.


                               RAM
                    You think we can make it there?


                               TRON
                    We have to.


                               FLYNN
                      (pointing to a corner
                           of the cave)
                    Hey, what's that?


         They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
         can just be seen. Ram gets up.


                               RAM
                    it's just what we need.


    262  INT. NICHE                                                   262


         Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
         brilliant LIGHT.


                               TRON
                    Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
                    good fresh energy feels, till you get
                    to a pure source...
                            (to Flynn)
                    Have some...you'll need it.


         Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.


                               FLYNN
                         (wiping his mouth)
                    well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
                    Master Control?


         Tron and Ram are taken aback.


                               TRON
                    What, just the three of us?


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    You know anybody that's got an army for
                    rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
                    to go take that sucker out. An' let's
                    face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
                    weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
                    while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
                    what does he care whether you guys get
                    killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
                    quarters?


                               RAM
                            (to Tron)
                    Do you know what he's talking about?


                               TRON
                            (to Flynn)
                    I have to find out what Alan wants...
                    that comes first.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
                    what to -


         Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    What's that?


                               TRON
                    Tanks...coming back. Let's go.


         With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
         men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
         into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.


 263-265 OMIT                                                         263-265

         The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
         avenues of escape in the terrain below.


                               FLYNN
                              (points)
                    How about over there...that empty
                    memory?


                               TRON
                           (shakes head)
                    No good...they might block off the
                    old chip.
                             (points)
                    This way.


         The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
         the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
         EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.

         from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
         arroyo.


    268  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           268


         They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
         entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
         narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
         to the edge of a gaping ravine.


         Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
         ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
         to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                    The bridge! Come on!


         The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
         lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
         three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
         turning the corner.

    270  SHOT OF THE BRIDGE                                           270


         Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
         the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
         tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
         him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
         and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
         SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.


         He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
         below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.


         The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
         speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

         Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet,
         sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him
         up.

         in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
         behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
         the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
         blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
         lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.

         speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
         the cityscape tower in the distance.

    277  SHOT IN FRONT OF HIM - HIS FACE                              277

         Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
         moving in his direction.

    278  FLYNN AND RAM                                                278


         Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
         getting darker.


                               FLYNN
                    You gonna make it?


         Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
         lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
         leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
         out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:

         arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening.
         Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
         and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.

                                                   CUT TO:

    280  FLYNN AND RAM                                                280


         sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious
         anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.

         Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
         platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
         Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
         then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
         looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
         the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
         glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
         it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
         RUMBLE.

                               FLYNN
                       (stumbling, trying to
                         keep his balance)
                    Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -


         Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
         instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
         shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
         Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
         position.

    282  EXT. SHOT OF THE RECOGNIZER                                  282


         as it stands up, covered with a static overlay, partially de-rezzed.


    283  INT. RECOGNIZER                                              283


         Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.


         Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
         going fast.


                               FLYNN
                    You okay? You don't look so good.


         Ram nods weakly.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Hang on. We'll get you outta here.


         Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
         no result.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Damn! Never fails... minute the
                    warranty runs out...


                               RAM
                    Come here.


         Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
         Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
         Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... !


                               RAM
                    Little more juice's all it needs...


         Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
         Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
         but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
         gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    284  THE CITY LANDSCAPE                                           284


         Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
         landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
         rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
         NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.


    285  TRON'S POV                                                   285


         A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.


    286  EXT. CITY LANDSCAPE                                          286

         He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
         figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
         it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
         figure, dissolving it.


    287  CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE                                         287


         Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
         figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
         Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
         at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
         head sadly, but walks on.


    288  TRON TURNS A CORNER                                          288


         Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building.


    289  CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE                                      289

         This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side,
         figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
         building stand a small group of the memory guards.

         This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
         sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
         then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
         One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
         gives a violent shake, then stops.


                               FLYNN
                    Never gonna figure out how to work
                    this thing...


         There's a NOISE from above. He looks up.

         We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment.


    294  FLYNN                                                        294


         His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
         to be still examining things.

         Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
         to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.


    296  WIDE SHOT                                                    296


         Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
         a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
         comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay -- hold it right there!


         The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
         recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
         sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:


                               BIT
                    Yes!


         The Bit subsides into energy form again.


                               FLYNN
                        (still suspicious)
                    What do you mean, "'yes"?


                               BIT
                    Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.


         From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
         red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
         speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.


                               FLYNN
                    That all you can say?


                               BIT
                         (of course not,
                         you know better)
                    No, nyet, negatory, not on your
                    tintype, no way.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh. Anything else?


                               BIT
                    Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.


                               FLYNN
                    only yes and no...
                             (it dawns)
                    You're a bit.

                               FLYNN
                    where's your program? Won't it miss you?


                               BIT
                            (confused)
                    No...


         Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm your program?


                               BIT
                            (emphatic)
                    Right on the money!


                               FLYNN
                              (sighs)
                    Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
                    chance know how to drive this crate?


         In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
         platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
         stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
         grabs the cross-bar.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Like so?


         Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
         and it takes off like a bat out of hell

         into a wall and bouncing off another one.

         This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
         inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
         of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
         elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
         partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
         We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
         only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
         interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
         Tron looks farther down the corridor.

         We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
         Tron.

         as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.


         As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
         grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
         The line of workers mechanically files on past.


         We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
         his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
         half-heartedly.


                               TRON
                    I'm not gonna hurt you.


         She stops struggling.

                    I'm going to let you go now... don't
                    scream, or I'll be very sorry.


         His hands loosen, and he releases her.

         time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,

                               TRON

         He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
         made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
         watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
         her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.


                               GIRL

         Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
         the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
         and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
         hear snatches of conversation.

         Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls

    311  YORI                                                         311


         She shivers, and holds Tron's hand tighter.


                                                   CUT TO:


    312  EXT. YORI'S BUILDING - LONG SHOT                             312


         Tron and Yori arrive at the ground level entrance.


    313  INT. HALLWAYS                                                313


         Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
         She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.


                                                   CUT TO:


    314  INT. YORI'S APARTMENT                                        314


         As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
         window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
         looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
         walls and floors.

                               YORI
                    My quarters.

                               TRON
                    Why is everything...like this?


                               YORI
                    It's a flat. But wait a micro...


         She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
         a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
         the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
         three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
         charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
         the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
         aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.


    315  HIS POV                                                      315


         With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
         extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
         shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
         diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
         her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
         by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
         Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.


                               YORI
                    Come here.


    316  TRON                                                         316


         His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
         being fully rewarded for his efforts.


                               TRON
                    You're beautiful, Yori.


    317  SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                            317

         as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
         flattened palms.


         Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
         glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.


                               YORI
                    You've grown, big program.


                               TRON
                    I had to...in the games...


         They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
         the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
         what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
         room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
         other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
         moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
         trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
         are enveloped in the cloud of stars...


                                                   SLOW, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


    318  EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER                                        318


         hovering in the air above the factory city, moving slowly forward.
         ZOOM OUT past the carrier towards the landscape beyond.

    319  EXT. CITY - L0NG SHOT                                        319


         A slightly out-of-control Recognizer arrives in the city, wobbling,
         careening, glancing off a building or two.


 320-321 OMIT                                                         320-321

    322  INT. RECOGNIZER                                              322


         Flynn is having trouble controlling the Reco.


                               FLYNN
                    This honey doesn't handle so good
                    in town...

                    No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!


         He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
         light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
         only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
         shouting:


                               BIT
                    Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -


         Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that
         he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.


                               BIT
                           (that's more
                             like it)
                    Right, confirmed, I couldn't have

         as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it,
         with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air,
         landing in what looks like a garbage dump.


                                                   CUT TO:

         as Flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris, the Bit nervously
         hovering over him.


                               FLYNN
                              (to Bit)

         A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
         from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
         his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
         they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
         him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
                    Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
                    for your concern. So long.


         They move on.


                               FLYNN
                            (to the Bit)

    328  EXT. CITY PLAZA                                              328


         Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
         the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
         bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.


                               PROGRAMS
                    I have to re-route the insurance

                    receivable adjustment for Sark...
                    Certainly... the MCP wants only
                    minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.


    329  EXT. THE BASE OF THE I/0 TOWER                               329


         It looms high overhead.


    330  TRON AND YORI                                                330


         on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
         approaching a wide door in the wall.


    331  INSIDE THIS DOOR'                                            331


         We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
         rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
         and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.


    332  SHOT FROM BELOW THEM                                         332

         looking upwards as they move.

    333  THE UPPER FLOOR                                              333


         as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and
         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
         and beyond.


         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.


 334-349 OMIT                                                         334-349

    350  THE CENTRAL CHAMBER                                          350


         of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one
         wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.


         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
         only blackness beyond.


    351  DUMONT'S FACE                                                351

         asleep.

         Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide
         room, their footsteps ECHOING.

    375  CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT                         375

         Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.


                               YORI
                             (quietly)
                    Dumont... ?


         The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
         recognize either one.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes?


                               TRON
                             (nervous)
                    I... have come to communicate with
                    my User.


                               DUMONT
                    Hmm. A difficult proposition...
                    difficult proposition at best.
                       (indicates empty chamber)
                    Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
                    exactly packing them in these days ...


                               YORI
                    Yes...what--?


                               DUMONT
                    You know, not so long ago, you
                    could've come in here and seen
                    programs lined up all the way back
                    to those doors, waiting for communion
                    with their Users. The building fund
                    was doing well too...but now...
                               (sighs)
                    ...this so-called Master Control
                    Program is going around cutting
                    programs off from their natural
                    creators, grabbing all our believers
                    and making them ride around on little
                    motor scooters and shoot things at
                    each other and Weiner knows what all--
                    oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
                    of faith...


                               TRON
                    Well I want to communicate --

                               DUMONT
                    Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
                    get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
                    you in here. They hate this tower.
                    They'd close it down if they dared
                    to but they keep me around, in case
                    one of them wants to deal with the
                    other world once in a while. And
                    you should hear the way they commune!
                    Sounds like they were routing a
                    payroll, for all the heart they put
                    in it. No, I don't think you


         Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.


                               TRON
                    Dumont... my User has information
                    that could -- could make this a
                    free system again.


                               DUMONT
                    Hah.


                               TRON
                    Really. You'd have programs lined
                    up around the block to use this
                    place -- and no MCP looking over your
                    shoulder.


                               DUMONT
                               (sighs)
                    When you've been in the system as long
                    as I have, you hear many promises...
                    many reassurances...many brave plans...


         He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:


                               DUMONT (CONT.)
                           (falling into ritual)
                    Who is your User, program?


                               TRON
                    Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?


                               DUMONT
                    All that is visible must grow beyond
                    itself and extend into the realm of
                    the invisible.


         Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.


                               DUMONT
                    You may pass, my friend.


         Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness

         We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring
         curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.

         We see a face peer around it. Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    This is where Tron said he was going...


         Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
         the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
         down the hall, Bit following.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Looks like his kind of place, too...
                    real serious.


         CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
         the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
         corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

         Sark... and a force of guards and six Blue Warriors. Sark is in
         front, enjoyment on his face. As far as he's concerned he's just
         going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is
         trapped.

         The file of men is moving away. We can see that there is a wide ledge
         about ten feet up the wall, containing the lighting source.

         lifting his staff.

         We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning
         over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
         places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue
         static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his
         arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes.

         I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and
         Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.


                               SARK

    392  THE HEART OF THE TOWER                                       392


         We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
         golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
         surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
         Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.


    393  INT. COMMUNICATION BELL                                      393


         Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
         which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
         sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
         surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
         this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
         within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
         down, and then up.


    394  HIS POV                                                      394


         The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.


    395  FROM THE OPENING                                             395


         We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
         into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
         inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
         above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
         his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
         knowledge of the experience to come.


    396  A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.            396


         He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
         high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
         happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
         light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
         illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
         force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
         from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
         of the light.

         hands drop to his sides. The disk rises out of sight, and we

         A machine, floating above the floor, with a pointed cone facing the
         door, is switched on, and a blast of pure electricity leaps from it
         to the surface of the door with the SOUND of sizzling LIGHTNING

         Tron is looking upwards. Suddenly a voice booms out, echoing, and
         distorted, Alan's voice.


                               ALAN V.0.
                    TRON... TRON... Location query...

         In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
         transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
         at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
         bright light at the center.


         We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the
         others dim.

         consumed by static.

         The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and
         gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It
         slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it,
         pulls it down and stares at it.

         He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the
         neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he
         has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming
         winglike supports for the fabric.

         As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly.
         Then he holds out his hand to Yori.

         Tron and Yori enter. Solar Sailer simulation hovers.


    417  A LONG SHOT                                                  417


         As Tron and Yori race across the floor.


                               YORI (V.0.)
                    This way...there's a simulation
                    we can use...


         And we see them race towards it.

         ABOVE, LOOKING DOWN AT THEM.

    419  A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON         419
         AND YORI

         We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
         designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
         enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
         move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft,
         and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
         made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
         look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
         transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
         information paths to the Central Processing Unit.

                               TRON V.O.
                    Can it carry us?


                               YORI V.0.
                    The design is good... We don't know
                    why the User abandoned the project...


         The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
         forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
         into place.


    420  SHOT OF THEM FROM THE LONG WALKWAY, FACING THE STERN         420


         We see Yori bending over a console of touch panels.


                               YORI
                    Yes...it can take us across the
                    Sea of Simulation... all the way
                    out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.


                               TRON
                           (looking out
                            of hangar)
                    As long as it gets us out of here


    421  EXT. HANGAR                                                  421


         The crowd of Sark's men are racing towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    422  EXT. SOLAR SAILER DECK - TRON AND YORI                       422


         Bending over the console, from the POV of the sail. As we watch, a
         head leans into the frame from the right. A memory guard. Then we
         see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the
         left.


                                                   CUT TO:


    423  THE TWO OF THEM FROM A LOW ANGLE                             423


         On the console, as Yori leans over it. We see that she is looking at
         a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the
         beam transfer points and transmission location.


                                                   CUT TO:


    424  THE TWO GUARDS, CREEPING DOWN THE WALKWAY                    424


         silently. We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise. His head snaps
         up; he sees the guards.


                               TRON
                    Yori! Get down!


    425  THE GUARDS                                                   425


         Abandoning any attempt at silence, leap forward, shouting, thrusting
         their staffs at Tron.


                                                   CUT TO:


    426  A LOW ANGLE, AS TRON KICKS THE FIRST GUARD BACK              426


         and slashes the second across the face, knocking him out.

                                                   CUT TO:


    427  EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE HANGAR                                  427


         As Sark's men rush in and head for the stairs to the catwalks that
         ring the hangar walls. They start swarming up.


                                                   CUT TO:


    428  TRON                                                         428

         reacting, holding his disk ready.

    430  WALKWAY OF SAILER                                            430


         as guards start swarming on board. We see Tron move forward and then
         stop, letting them come.


                                                   CUT TO:

    431  YORI'S POV - LONG SHOT                                       431


         looking down at the walkway. Beyond it we can see the great door
         starting to rise.

    432  TRON                                                         432


         throwing his disk. It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them
         backwards.


                                                   CUT TO:


    433  A SHOT FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE HANGAR                       433


         The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with
         its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
         racing towards the hangar.


    434  TRON                                                         434


         Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
         We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
         connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
         guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
         There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
         his balance.


    435  YORI                                                         435


         smiling.


                               YORI
                    We're off!


    436  EXT. HANGAR                                                  436


         The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
         from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
         it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
         accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
         seconds.


    437  EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - BRIDGE - SARK & MCP                  437

         Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
         front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
         the Solar Sailer -- racing away.


                               MCP
                    I hope you've enjoyed being a command
                    program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
                    working in a pocket calculator... maybe
                    one of those watches that plays "Happy
                    Birthday" to its User once a year.


                               SARK
                    Now, sir... We did take care of that
                    User you sent us --


                               MCP
                    Yes, and now you've got two renegade
                    programs running all the hell over the
                    system in a stolen simulation.


                               SARK
                    We'll get them, sir... These things
                    take time.


                               MCP
                    I don't have time, Sark. And neither
                    do you. End of line.


 438-439 OMIT                                                         438-439


    440  SOLAR SAILER - WALKWAY - TRON                                440


         from the stern. Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was
         thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera).
         He stops, seeing something.


                               YORI V.O.
                    Tron, are you all right?


         Tron waves at her... then...


    441  CLOSE SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON                             441


         He looks over at the guard rail.

         fingers gripping the rail. ZOOM IN on the fingers.

    443  A SHOT FROM BELOW THE WALKWAY                                443


         Several yards away from it. We see one of the blue warriors hanging
         on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the
         edge, look over and see this guard.


    444  CLOSE SHOT OF TRON                                           444


         By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his
         disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing
         shape comes into the frame from bottom right.


                               BIT

                               TRON
                    Flynn!!


    447  SIDE SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                       447

                    Greetings, program...


                               TRON

                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, I... oops!


         He loses his grip, and starts to fall. But Tron, just in time, grabs
         Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up. We see the blue static guard
         disguise fade off Flynn.


    449  YORI                                                         449

         leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up
         the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit.

                    Who is this?


         We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise...
         but then realize his mistake.


                               TRON
                             (smiling)
                    Flynn...

                          Flynn eagerly)
                    Where's Ram?


                               FLYNN
                    I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
                    he didn't make it.


         Tron shakes his head, sadly.

                             (to Yori)
                    This is Flynn... the one who
                    busted me out.

                            (to Flynn)
                    Then I owe you some thanks...


                               FLYNN
                    No big deal. I ought to know my way
                    around that Light Cycles routine...
                    I mean, I did write the program for it.


                               TRON
                            (mystified)
                    Wrote the...?


                               FLYNN
                    It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
                    I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
                    User.


         Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.


                               YORI
                    A User -- in our world?


                               FLYNN
                               (nods)
                    Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...


                               TRON
                    But -- if you're a User -- then
                    everything you've done has been
                    part of a plan ...


                               FLYNN
                              (laughs)
                    You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
                    to think since I got down here. I mean
                    in here. Out here. Whatever.


                               TRON
                    Then...


                               FLYNN
                    Look, you guys know how it is. You just
                    keep doin' what it looks like you're
                    supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
                    you hope to hell your User knows what's
                    goin' on.


                               TRON
                    Well -- that's how it is for programs,
                    yes, but --


                               FLYNN
                    I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
                    time, that's how it is for Users, too.


                               TRON
                    Stranger and stranger...


                               BIT
                    You said it.

                        (pats Tron on back)
                    So... Nice ship you got here. What's our
                    next move?

                             (smiles)
                    Remember you wanted to pay a call on
                    the MCP?


         Flynn nods.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    We're on our way.
                             (indicates disk)
                    Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go
                    up against Master

                               FLYNN
                    All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,
                    at least.

         The aircraft carrier rolls past the camera.

    452  THE BRIDGE - SARK                                            452


         looking out the observation window, as his lieutenant approaches
         from behind.

                               LIEUTENANT
                    Sir, what do you want done with
                    the tower guardian, Dumont?
                    Put him with the others?


                               SARK
                    No, bit brain.

         Sark turns to face him.


                               SARK


                    Prepare him for inquisition. I need
                    a little relaxation. But first rez up
                    the carrier for pursuit... And one other
                    thing.


         lie stares at the lieutenant, paranoid


                               SARK
                           (continuing)
                    Don'tthink anymore. I do the
                   thinkingaround here.

         We see Flynn looking back the way they came. Yori is at the controls,
         with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                    What about our friend - Sark?


                               TRON
                    Probably decided not to pursue us,
                    The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
                    lot of illusions...rough navigating.
                    Programs have a way of just...
                    disappearing here.

                               FLYNN
                    Not us, I hope.


                               TRON
                         (shakes his head,
                          indicates disk)
                    Not with this disk. I'm going to
                    check on the beam connection, Yori.
                    You two can keep a watch out for
                    grid bugs.


         He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following. Flynn turns and
         leans out over the side.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy the view from up here... you
                    know the territory?


                               YORI
                    A little ...
                       (points out sights)
                    Over there, the Mountains of Data...
                    and I think that's the Silicon Valley...

                             (pointing)
                    What's wrong with that area?

         We see an area of darkened, gloomy, two-dimensional shapes.


                               YORI
                              (sadly)
                    The MCP blasted it... There are very
                    few domains left with any power at all.


                               FLYNN
                    Lousy utility companies ...
                    they're the same wherever you go.

         Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets. Two memory
         guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
         Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
         expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
         torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA
         PULLS BACK AND ANGLES UP to the second level where we see Sark
         looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell.

                    Busy dying, you worn-out excuse for
                    an old program.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes, I'm old.

                            (continuing)
                    Old enough to remember the MCP when he
                    was just a chess program. He started
                    small, and he'll end small.

                         head and laughs)
                    That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I
                    should keep you around, just to make me
                    laugh.

         We see Tron at the bow. Flynn and Yori are up on the deck near the
         controls, with the Bit hovering over them. Yori is, pointing
         something out to Flynn.

         We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer
         increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing
         energy, coming towards the ship. It hits the sail, and the ship
         shivers. The whole beam is now tripled in brightness.

         against him... they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the
         increasing beam.

                    too strong!


                               TRON
                    We have to get off this beam!

                             (frantic)

                    There's another beam!


                               YORI
                    It's too far!


         Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and
         races forward.

         is blasting away at the sails. He slows down, but keeps going.

         We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly
         illuminated by the beam. He reaches forward with one arm.

         He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light. He
         raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but
         too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same
         intensity as the beam.

         from his arm.

         We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring
         transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then
         breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting
         to the safe beam.

         The craft starts to travel safely on its way.

         as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can
         see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a
         moment, dazed.

                               FLYNN
                              (weakly)
                    Did we make it?

                    Yes.


         Flynn smiles weakly.


                               FLYNN
                    Hooray for our side...


         He faints.

         Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn
         stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on
         either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit
         is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer
         is passing through a series of narrow canyons.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... you guys OK?


                               TRON
                              (nods)
                    How about you?


                               FLYNN
                    Aah, I'm fine... little hung over
                    is all...


                               YORI
                    How did you do that, Flynn?


                               FLYNN
                            (sitting up)
                    Elementary physics... a beam of
                    energy can always be diverted...
                    ooh, my head
                          (looks around --
                              to Yori)
                    Are we there yet, Mommy?


                               YORI
                    Almost... I just have to adjust our
                    course at the next junction. I'd better
                    go check the instruments ...


         She heads O.S., toward the bow.

         The Sailer is about to pass the mouth of another canyon.

         Tron looks away from Flynn for a moment to check the Sailer's
         progress.

         as the new canyon comes into sight. CAMERA LOOKS UP AND UP... to the
         immense bulk of the aircraft carrier, moving fast toward the Sailer.

         The carrier lurches forward and rams the Sailer, splitting it in
         half.


 521-523 OMIT                                                         521-523


    524  YORI AND FLYNN                                               524


         Falling on top of one another, Flynn trying to pull Yori out of the
         way as the bulk of the carrier appears to slam into Tron and he's
         gone.

         falling through space.

    526  FLYNN AND YORI                                               526


         As the carrier keeps moving forward. Flynn holding Yori, and the Bit
         hovers beside them. A second level of the carrier, with an open hold,
         comes rushing at them.

         The gaping hold rushes forward and the screen goes black.

         Their half of the Sailer is scooped up into the carrier.


                                                   CUT TO:

         catching hold of something. He is swinging freely. Hanging onto a
         wall, he starts pulling his feet up to gain a precarious foothold.

         inside the door, shoulders slumped and we can see that his disk has
         been removed.

         Dumont holds Yori as she SOBS.


                               DUMONT
                    Quietly, Yori...


         He looks up.


                               DUMONT
                            (continuing)
                    Tron... ?


         Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the
         wall.


                               YORI
                    He's dead.


                               DUMONT
                           (sighs, looks
                             at Flynn)
                    And who is this?


                               YORI
                    He's a User, Dumont. He came to
                    our world... trying to help us...


         Her voice breaks, she turns away.


                               DUMONT
                            (despairing)
                    If the Users can no longer help us...


         His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the
         cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the
         cell door.


                               SARK
                    So... we have erased the program that -


         As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You! No!


         Flynn looks up curiously.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You died! I saw you!


                               FLYNN
                    Not me, boss.


                               SARK
                    Well... we can take care of that
                    soon enough.


         He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    Take this program to the holding pit.


         The guards start to drag Dumont out.


                               YORI
                        (rushing after him)
                    Dumont...!


         A guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell.


                               SARK
                        (indicates Dumont)
                    I'm taking our friend here, and
                    some other religious fanatics, to
                    Master Control... the MCP has expressed
                    an interest in assimilating them --
                    probably for archival purposes.
                    I'm not going back to the Game Grid
                    on this ship, though -- I'll take
                    the Transport Beam.
                             (smiles)
                    Less traffic. But when I disembark,
                    this ship...and everything that remains
                    on board...will automatically de-rez.
                    This means you.

                    Enjoy your trip...


         LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow.


    533  SHOT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PIT CELLS                         533


         into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs,
         the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards
         beginning to herd them out.


    534  ANGLE - LEVEL ABOVE CELLS                                    534

         into the cells at his feet and laughs again.

         vast plain covered with a glowing grid.

         ship's structure is moving forward.

         As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the
         carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up
         speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck
         clinging to one side of the pod...


    543A CLOSE UP - SPECK                                             543A


         TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack.


    544  FLYNN, YORI AND THE BIT                                      544


         Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door
         testing it, running his finger along the edges.


    545  LONG SHOT                                                    545


         Of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the MCP's
         mesa.

         from behind the carrier of the pod getting smaller with distance.

         Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more
         and more detail visible.

         tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for
         landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
         shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes,
         fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
         structure.

         There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
         the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
         Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
         gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
         the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
         black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
         rises out of the center of this cylinder.

         Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the
         door.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


         The door is disappearing, dissolving.

         He stops in horror.


                                                   CUT TO:


    552  HIS POV                                                      552


         Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them.
         She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks
         up dimly at Flynn, with no expression.


    553  WIDE SHOT                                                    553


         Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging
         her close, his energy flowing into her.


         Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is
         too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.


                               FLYNN
                    Yori!

         Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
         Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
         floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
         Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.


                               YORI
                             (in awe)
                    You... you brought me back...?
                    Why...? How ... ?


         Flynn lets go of her.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!


         He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
         to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
         Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
         Suddenly the Bit pops into life.


                               BIT
                    Yes!


                               FLYNN
                    Let's get outta here.


         They head for the door.

         The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
         them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
         The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
         path.

         on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a
         speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
         over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
         arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.

    557  CLOSER SHOT                                                  557

         It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant.

         from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside,
         up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP.

         watching them, his back to the camera.

    560  POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS                                   560


         As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
         beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
         finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
         network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
         surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
         the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
         impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
         but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
         inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
         continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
         STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
         the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.


                               MCP
                      (echoing, booming)
                    I am delighted that so many of you
                    could turn out to give your
                    power over to me...

         lining the wall. They are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see
         them starting to de-rez.


                               MCP
                    You're very lucky, all of you. You
                    are participating in the creation of
                    the single most powerful program in
                    the history of the system... of all
                    systems...


         The programs begin to disappear, one by one.

         Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner
         chamber.

         Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards
         in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
         the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
         the window.

         Down the length of the carrier. It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone
         already. We see the CPU approaching, as the carrier rises.

                    Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
                    finally come to terms with one
                    another...

         Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to
         depart. His back is to the camera.

                               VOICE
                    SARK!


         Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..


    570  SARK'S POV                                                   570


         We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in
         one hand. It gives off a pure white light.


    571  CLOSE UP SARK'S FACE                                         571

                    It doesn't matter. Prepare to
                    terminate.

         Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist.

    573  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              573


         as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
         under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
         again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
         two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
         races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.

         His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great
         pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.

         Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and
         immediately throws his own disk.

         He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as
         Sark's disk passes under him.

                    should have joined me.

         He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind,
         and holds up his own disk as a shield.


                               SARK

         With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through
         Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we
         see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the
         disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see
         energy pouring out of this wound like blood.

         Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
         returns to him.

         to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy. The hand moves.


    604  TRON                                                         604


         throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.


                               MCP
                           (thundering)
                    SARK!!!


    605  SARK                                                         605


         His body is glowing, expanding. He starts to rise, his face looks up.

    606  CLOSE UP - FACE                                              606


         It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping
         hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises.


    607  LONG SHOT                                                    607

         Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out,
         from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the
         beam.

    608  OMITTED                                                      608

    609  HIS POV OF BEAM                                              609


         very close.


    610  SHOT OF YORI AND FLYNN                                       610


                               FLYNN
                    Yori, steer us over the beam,
                    right next to it.


                               YORI
                       (going to controls)
                    Why? What are you going to do?


                               FLYNN
                           (staring down)
                    Jump.


         Yori looks up.


                               YORI
                    But... won't you be de-rezzed?


                               FLYNN
                           (turns to her)
                    Probably.


    611  INT. MCP - TRON                                              611


         about to fire again. There's a sudden roar and Tron turns.


    612  TRON'S POV OF GIANT SARK                                     612


         Who rips open the doorway into the MCP and advances.


    613  BRIDGE                                                       613


         Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
         goes up to him.


                               YORI
                    Flynn... you can't... I


                               FLYNN
                          (lays finger on
                             her lips)
                    Shhhhh.


         He takes her in his arms.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                               (whispering)
                    I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
                    just once...


         His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
         change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
         love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.


    614  CLOSE UP - THEIR FACES                                       614


         Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second,
         then open.


                               FLYNN
                    Don't worry.


    615  LONGER SHOT                                                  615


         He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
         on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
         shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.


    616  HER POV                                                      616


         Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
         directly into the center of MCP itself.


    617  INT. MCP                                                     617


         Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
         his voice is that of the MCP.


                               SARK/MCP
                    End of line, program...


         We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
         static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
         Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
         Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
         and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
         and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
         cones. And connects.


    618  SHOT OF THE APEX                                             618

         A brilliant explosion of lights bursts out.


    619  SHOT OF SARK                                                 619


         Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
         into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.


    620  SHOT OF THE MCP                                              620


         We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
         is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
         padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
         wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
         see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
         too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
         the MCP glows brighter and brighter.


    621  YORI AND THE BIT                                             621

         on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.

    622  HER POV                                                      622

         A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
         camera.

    623  YORI                                                         623

         shielding her face from the power of the blast.

    624  LONG SHOT                                                    624


         The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
         returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
         leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.

    625  YORI                                                         625


         still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
         regaining their life.

    626  HER POV                                                      626

         one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
         brightly, increasing.

    627  LONG SHOT                                                    627

         The carrier starts to descend.

                                                   CUT TO:


    628  EXT. CPU MESA - TRON                                         628

         Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
         programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.

    629  SHOT OF CARRIER                                              629

         Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
         faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.

    630  EXT. CPU MESA                                                630

         Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
         her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
         in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.

                               TRON
                            (laughing)
                    Nice...

                               YORI
                    It's something Users do.

                               TRON
                    Where's Flynn?

         He looks up at the bridge.

                               YORI
                    He's gone. He went into the beam.
                    He saved you. He saved all of us.

         Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
         the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.

                               DUMONT
                    He really was a User...

                               BIT
                         (quietly, sadly)
                    Yes...

    631  LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD                                      631

         of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
         shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    632  RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN                              632


         and returning to the real world.


    633  THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB                                   633


         CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
         blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.


         WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
         chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.


         Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
         shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
         back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
         himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.


         He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
         flesh and blood.


         He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
         weak sunlight coming in.


         And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
         Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
         coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.


         Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
         document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
         face.


         The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
         tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    634  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA                           634


         Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
         CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey -- you guys


         Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
         a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.


                               ALAN
                    Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
                    new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
                    and -- it's running.


                               FLYNN
                    I know, I met him.


         Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
         from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    I mean, I saw it read-up -
                    hey, look at this.


         He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
         reading it to figure out its significance.


                               ALAN
                    Your old files -- ?


                               FLYNN
                    And Dillinger's instructions to
                    divert them -- it's all there -
                    look, even his home phone number,
                    when he logged on.


                               ALAN
                    Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
                    the goods...


         Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
         get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.


                               FLYNN
                    You're telling me...


         As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
         on it.


    635  CRT SCREEN                                                   635


         The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
         are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
         typical video game:


         A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
         electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
         first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
         directions.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    you have any idea how much I can sue these
                    jokers for?


                               LORA (V.0.)
                    Well, just don't forget your old friends
                    when you're rich and famous.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
                    this joint by then...


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                   Your friend Dillinger sure won't...


         The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
         EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
         SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
         formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
         HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.


                               FLYNN (V.O.)
                    Hey, you know anybody who wants to
                    get hold of some video games... cheap?


                               LORA (V.O.)
                    You're getting out of the business?


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                    Shouldn't you wait till your
                    lawsuit's settled?


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
                    video games to last me a good long
                    time. I feel like gettin' into some
                    real life...


         at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
         yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
         HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and


                                                        BLACK OUT.

    1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1

         On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
         printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
         speaking.

                               VOICE
                    As astonishing advances in computer
                    science are made, artificial intelligence
                    programs are being designed to assist
                    us in every area of life...

         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.

                               VOICE (CONT.)
                    In a world-wide network of electronics,
                    they travel through miles of circuitry
                    at the speed of light. We created them to
                    calculate and research, to help us design
                    and heal and think. With all that they can
                    do, are they only electrical impulses...
                    or are they a new form of life?

         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
         the screen in huge letters.

                                    T R O N ! !

         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
         if it had an inner core of electricity.

         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.


         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
         electronic information in our computers, television sets and
         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
         the window of television screens.


                                                   CUT TO:


    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2

         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
         encasing them.


                                                   CUT TO:


    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3


         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
         other.


                                                   CUT TO:


    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4


         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.


    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5


         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
         electronic beeping and popping.


    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6


         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
         like a crack of lightning.


    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7


         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
         maze.


    8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9


    10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10

         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
         glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
         one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
         warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.


    11   REAL WORLD                                                   11


         A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
         throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
         glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
         down, LAUGHING.

    12   OMITTED                                                      12

    13   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             13


         Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
         at each other.

    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14


         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
         the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
         yellow.


    15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15

         fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.

    16   SARK                                                         16

         sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
         back with violent force.

    16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A


         desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
         into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
         last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
         face as he falls to instant death.

    17   SARK                                                         17


         triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
         glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:

                        "WINNER:  BLUE - SARK!!"


                               BOY'S VOICE
                           (distant, echoing)
                    Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that
                    time.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    18   REAL WORLD - THE VIDEO ARCADE                                18


         We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we
         can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is
         prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM."


                               BOY


                    Lemme play you again?


                               TEENAGE GIRL
                            (holds out a hand)


                    Yeah, if you've got another quarter.


         FOCUS ON SCREEN, ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY AND


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     19  ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             19


         Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
         looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
         walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
         Sark comes in and one of them calls out:


                               WARRIOR 1


                    Sark, my man! You are hot!


                               WARRIOR 2
                    That knuckleball gets 'em every
                    time, boy...


         Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.


                                                   CUT TO:


    20   THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           20


         overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge,
         removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
         sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
         satisfaction.

         The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
         cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
         solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
         hidden from view.


    21   INT. CYLINDER - SARK'S POV                                   21


         of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
         ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features,
         appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.


                               VOICE (MCP)
                    You're getting brutal, Sark.
                    Brutal and needlessly sadistic.


         The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
         a drug addict, eyes glazed.


                               SARK
                    Thank. you, Master Control.


                               MCP
                    We might be capturing some military
                    programs soon... that interest you?


                               SARK
                    Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
                    guys ... be a nice break from these
                    accounting creampuffs you keep sending
                    me. Which branch of the service?


                               MCP
                    Strategic Air Command.


                               SARK (impressed)
                    Nice.

         The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we
         CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to:


    22   A CORRIDOR BENEATH THE GAME GRID                             22


         long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character
         (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..


                               CAPTIVE (CROM)
                    Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
                    a compound interest program, I work
                    at a savings and loan. I can't play
                    in these video games...

                               GUARD
                    Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
                    athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...


                               CROM
                    Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
                    check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
                    of breath. Hey, really...you're
                    gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
                    really mad. He's a full branch manager...


                               GUARD
                         (rolls his eyes)
                    Great, another religious nut.


         They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
         protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.


    23   INT. CELL                                                    23


         as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
         shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
         an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
         we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
         other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:


                               PROGRAM (RAM)
                    Welcome to luxury living.


         The new captive looks up, nervous.


                               CROM
                    Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
                    what I'm doing here.


                               RAM


                    You believe in the Users?


                               CROM
                    Sure, if I don't have a User, then
                    who wrote me?


                               RAM
                    That's what you're doing here. Master
                    Control Program's been snapping up
                    all us programs who believe...if he
                    thinks you're useful, he takes over
                    all your functions so he gets bigger...
                    an' if he can't use you, he sends you
                    down here to the Game Grid to get the
                    bits blasted outta you. What's your name?


                               CROM
                    Crom.


                               RAM


                    I'm Ram. They'll train you for
                    the games, but ... well, I hope you
                    make it okay. Hey, what's going on
                    in the other sectors? I've been stuck
                    in this Grid for 200 microcycles.


         He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.


                               CROM
                    It's murder out there. You can't even
                    travel around your own microcircuits
                    without permission from that Master
                    Control creep. Hauling me down here to
                    play games...who does he calculate he is?

                         (holds his head in his hands)
                    If only Tron was still around...


         He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
         still expression on his face.


                               CROM
                    You ever see that guy in action?
                    Hundred-percent independent. MCP
                    couldn't tell him what to --


         He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.


                               CROM
                           (continuing)
                    What's wrong? What did I say?


         There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.


                                                   CUT TO:


    24   THE FIGURE AT THE WINDOW                                     24


         It turns slowly, silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor.


    25   CLOSE UP - CROM                                              25


         reacting.  He GASPS and stares.

                               CROM
                    Oh my User...Tron--they've got
                    you in here?


    26   SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER                               26


         with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring.


                               TRON
                    Not for long, friend.


                                                   CUT TO:


    27   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR             27
         OFF IN THE SYSTEM


         Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
         one of the paths.

         A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
         and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
         coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck
         driver on an all-night run.


                               CLU
                    Think we can merge into this mem'ry
                    okay, good buddy?


         A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
         into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
         it speaks.

                            (eagerly)
                    10-4!


         As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light.


                               CLU
                    Now, ol' Flynn said to look over
                    in here ...

         The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded
         corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.

    28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B


                               CLU
                    ...but I don't see what he's looking
                    for. I'd better get over to that
                    input/output tower and let him know.

         A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal
         keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits
         for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of
         large video parlor game consoles.


                               FLYNN
                    Come on, you scuzzy little data,
                    be in there...


    30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30


         He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive,
         charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye.


                               FLYNN
                    I've got such nice blue paper to
                    print you out on, if you'll just sit
                    still...


         WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of
         the CRT screen reflected there.


                                                   CUT TO:


    31   ELECTRONIC WORLD--EXT TANK                                   31


         The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing
         "tower" -- an input/output component.


    32   INTERIOR TANK                                                32


         A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits
         up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next
         to his head.


                               CLU
                    Uh oh...we got company.

                    gonna hafta jump clear out of
                    the data stream.

         keys.


    34   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. OF TANK                              34


         We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
         distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
         U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
         a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.


    35   LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE                         35


         A second Reco is coming up behind the first.

         FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
         ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
         the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
         The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.


    38   CLOSE SHOT - TURRET                                          38


         Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
         from the tank, fast.

    39   LONG SHOT                                                    39


         A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
         Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
         see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.


    40   CLU                                                          40


         running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
         up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.


    41   CLOSE UP - CLU'S FACE                                        41


         reacting in fear, looking up as the screen GOES TO BLACK.

         SHOT OF THE SCREEN. A complex set of programming figures ends
         abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen
         over and over, gradually filling it completely.


    43   SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                           43

                    Ah, hell...busted again.


         He tries clearing the monitor, but the repeating line just comes
         right back, monotonously moving across the screen.

    45   ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER                            45


         Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like
         Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly,
         torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP.
         Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.


                               GUARD
                    Got a pirate program here... says
                    his name's Clu.


         The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling
         a suspect.


                               MCP
                    What'd he pull?


                               GUARD
                    Came into the system with a stolen
                    password ... an' we caught him
                    tryin' to raid a high-clearance
                    memory.


                               CLU
                       (looks up, his face
                        wracked with pain)
                    No...I must've gotten in there
                    by mistake, I -


         The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
         momentarily becomes unbearable.


                               MCP
                    Who programmed you?


         The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.


                               MCP (CONT.)
                    You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
                    But if you tell us who put you up
                    to it, you could make it easy on
                    yourself. Come on, who's your user?


                               CLU

                               MCP
                    Suit yourself ...


         The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
         doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
         pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
         electric static.


                               MCP

    46   THE REAL WORLD - EXT. CITY GRID - NIGHT - POV FROM           46
         HELICOPTER

         We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
         vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
         impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
         scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
         party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
         up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:

                               DILLINGER (O.S.)
                    Hello?
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mr. Dillinger?
                               DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yes.
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello, please hold a moment for the
                    Master Control Program


         As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
         focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
         an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
         approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
         accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
         increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
         sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
         landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
         CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
         a passenger.


    47   EXT. SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING                               47


                               PILOT'S VOICE
                    will you be around for a while, or
                    are you going right back out?


                               DILLINGER'S VOICE
                    Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
                    got some things to take care of.


         THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
         off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
         In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
         across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.

         We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter
         approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.

         on top of the building. Several technicians are at hand, and as the
         helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.

    58   INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT              58


         A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
         suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
         entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
         fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
         printed out on the screen:


         REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
         Password: MASTER.


         The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
         addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
         through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
         its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
         that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
         compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.


                               MCP
                    Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.


         Dillinger settles into a chair.


                               DILLINGER
                    No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
                    one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
                    What's up?


                               MCP
                    It's our friend the boy detective.
                    He's nosing around again.


                               DILLINGER

                               MCP
                    Yes.  It felt like Flynn.


                               DILLINGER
                    He's still looking for that old file...
                    can't you just appropriate it?


                               MCP
                    I would if I could find it. it's stashed
                    somewhere off in the system ...
                    out of my range. Meanwhile...


                               DILLINGER
                    Meanwhile, he might find it.


                               MCP
                    I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
                    and kicked him out, but he's getting
                    trickier all the time.


                               DILLINGER
                    I think we'd better shut off all
                    access till we can find that file.
                    Just to be safe.


                               MCP
                    There's a 68.71 percent chance
                    you're right.


                               DILLINGER

         a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
         popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is
         a small sign reading, "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto!" Alan types into
         the touch keyboard:

                    User code 717 - Bailey.
                    Password: FREEDOM.


         He starts to type again, but the screen clears and:


                    SCREEN ADDRESS FILE EMPTY.
                    TRON PROGRAM UNAVAILABLE.


                               ALAN
                            (surprised)
                    Huh...


         He pushes his chair back, leaves his office.

         Dillinger opens the door, welcoming Alan.


                               DILLINGER
                    Come on in...


                               ALAN
                    Alan. Alan Bailey.


                               DILLINGER
                    Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
                    seeding...great piece of work.
                    How's it going?


         He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.


                               ALAN
                    Well, I don't know...I just tried
                    to run this program I've been working
                    on, and I was denied access all of
                    a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
                    laid off and nobody told me.


                               DILLINGER
                    oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

                               ALAN
                    Yeah...?


                               DILLINGER
                    We have to close that down, just
                    briefly. Security reasons.  Someone
                    with that access has been tampering.


                               ALAN
                    I hope you don't think it's me.
                    I don't even balance my checkbook on
                    downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at
                    home for that.

                               DILLINGER
                    No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
                    It should only be a couple of days.
                    What's the thing you're working on?

                                ALAN
                    It's called Tron. It's a security
                    program itself, actually. Monitors
                    all the contacts between our system
                    and other systems... If it finds
                    anything going on that's not scheduled,
                    it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
                    on it.


                               DILLINGER
                    Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?


                               ALAN
                    No, it'll run independently.
                    It can watchdog the MCP as well.


                               DILLINGER
                    Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
                    you running again in a couple of days,
                    I hope.


                               ALAN
                    Ok

         Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:

                               DILLINGER
                               (trouble)
                    Oh boy.


         The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
         through the speakers.

                               MCP
                    Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry -


                               MCP
                            (sharply)
                    I can't afford to have an independent
                    program monitoring me. Do you have any
                    idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
                    How many programs I've appropriated?


                               DILLINGER
                                (nods)
                    It's my fault. I programmed you to want
                    so much...


                               MCP
                    And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
                    next week...


                               DILLINGER
                    The Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    It shouldn't be any harder than General
                    Motors was. But now...this is what I get
                    for using humans.


                               DILLINGER
                    Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.


                               MCP
                    I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.


                               DILLINGER
                    What do you want with the Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
                    I'm bored with corporations. With the
                    information I can access, I can run things
                    900 to 1200 times better than any human.


                               DILLINGER
                    If you think -


                               MCP
                    You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
                    and read it up on a VDT at the New
                    York Times, would you?


                               DILLINGER
                    You wouldn't dare.


                               MCP
                    So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
                    out of the system. And get me those Chinese
                    language program I asked for.

                    End of line.

         We see Alan push open the door under a sign reading "Laser Research."


                                                   CUT TO:

         Alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass WINDOW through
         which the laser laboratory is visible. A sign over the window,
         marked "Experiment in Progress," is illuminated by a red warning
         bulb.


   71/72 OMITTED                                                      71/72


     73  INT. LASER ROOM - LONG SHOT                                  73

         of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
         suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
         encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
         picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
         tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
         tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
         getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
         at them.


         We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
         with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
         using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
         hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
         wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
         has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
         bristling white eyebrows.


         In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
         defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
         Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
         at the moment.

         As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:


                               LORA
                              (sighs)
                    Well, here goes nothing ...


                               GIBBS
                    Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
                    hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."


                               LORA
                    Well, I meant -


                               GIBBS
                    Whereas actually, what we propose to
                    do is to turn something into nothing
                    and back again. So you might just as
                    well have said, "Here goes something
                    and here comes nothing." Hah?


         They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
         cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
         polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
         plat-form -- empty.


                               LORA
                    Let me make sure we're running


         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
         connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.


         Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
         console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
         the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
         close enough to watch.


    74   ANGLE - LORA                                                 74


         She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.


                               LORA
                    Looks good...


                               GIBBS (O.S.)


                    Let 'er rip...


    75   LASER LAB - AS BEFORE                                        75


         The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
         sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
         five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
         rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.


                               GIBBS
                             (quietly)
                    Perfect.


         At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
         and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
         shoe-covers, walking toward them.


                               ALAN
                    Beautiful!


                               GIBBS
                    Hello, Alan.


                               ALAN
                    Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
                    all day, and you guys are down here
                    disintegrating things and having fun.


         He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.


                               GIBBS
                    Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
                    While the laser is dismantling the
                    molecular structure of the object,
                    the computer maps out a holographic
                    model of it. The molecules themselves
                    are suspended in the laser beam. Then
                    the computer reads the model back out,
                    the molecules go back into place, and...
                          (indicates ball)
                    voila.


    75   CONTINUED                                                    75


                               ALAN
                    Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?


                               GIBBS
                    Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
                    and you must purchase your program
                    at least 30 days in advance. Hah!


         The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
         their arms around each other's shoulders.


                               LORA
                    How's it going upstairs?


                               ALAN
                    Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
                    to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
                    with Group 7 access out of the system.


         Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.


                               ALAN
                           (continuing)
                     Ever since he got that Master Control
                     Program set up, system's got more bugs
                     than a bait store.


                               GIBBS
                    Well, you have to expect some static.
                    Computers are just machines after all,
                    they can't think...


                               ALAN
                    They'll start to soon enough.


                               GIBBS
                              (wryly)
                    Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
                    will start thinking, and people will
                    stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
                    data through. See you tomorrow.


         AD LIB goodnights.


    78   INT. CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT                                   78


         outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the
         protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off
         her white suit, and Alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes.

         playing a game called Space Paranoids, CAMERA TILTING UP into his

         jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score.

         Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans.
         As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to

         favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
         noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans

                    not so bright, but very, very sneaky.

                    slime didn't even change the names --
                    and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus

                    coming out of the Master Control Program
                    saying there is something screwy --

                               GIBBS
                    That MCP, you know, that's half the
                    problem right --


                               DILLINGER
                    The MCP is the most efficient way of
                    handling what we do. I can't sit and
                    worry about every little user request that --


                               GIBBS
                    User requests are what computers are for.


                               DILLINGER
                    Doing our business is what computers are
                    for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
                    isn't the business you started in your garage
                    anymore --


         As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
         and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
         computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
         in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
         millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
         computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
         Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
         adding up, accounts receivable and assets.


                               DILLINGER (CONT.)
                    We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
                    we've got one of the largest systems in
                    existence...


         Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.


                               GIBBS
                    Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I
                    was back in that garage...


                               DILLINGER
                    It can be arranged...


         Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.


                               GIBBS
                    That was uncalled-for.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...
                    you feel like going for a drink?


                               GIBBS
                    Thank you, no. I have some work to do...
                    assuming I can still log on.


         He exits.


    102  EXT. ICOM BUILDING - NIGHT                                   102


         Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's
         main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box.


    102a INT. VAN                                                     102a


         A digital CLOCK on the dashboard reads 12:12. Lora is at the wheel,
         Alan next to her.


                               LORA
                    You better get in back with Flynn.
                    And keep down.


         She jerks her thumb over her shoulder.


                               ALAN
                    Do I gotta?


         But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward.


    103  CLOSE ON FLYNN AND ALAN                                      103


                               FLYNN
                    Hi, Alan.


                               ALAN
                            (resigned)
                    Hi, Flynn.


         Flynn pulls a bag of doughnuts from his pocket.


                               FLYNN
                            (explaining)
                    My dinner.


                               ALAN
                    I was wondering where you got that
                    glow of good health.


                               FLYNN
                    Want one?


                               ALAN
                    Uh... got any cinnamon?


         Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut.


                               LORA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Keep it down, you guys.


    104  EXT. ICOM - THE GIGANTIC SECURITY ENTRANCE - NIGHT           104


         Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM
         building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a
         magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.


                               LORA
                    I don't think I'm cleared for this.


                               ALAN
                    I'm certainly not.


                               FLYNN
                    Move aside. Let the kid have some room.

         He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black
         box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals
         and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock,
         his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a
         distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ...
         and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn
         starts LAUGHING.


    105  INT. A CORRIDOR                                              105


         The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to
         nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall.
         But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.


                               LORA
                    Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at
                    my terminal, down in the laser lab.
                    We'll be up in Alan's office.


                               FLYNN
                    Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
                    can get your Tron thing running...


                               LORA
                    As long as we stay off the top floor,
                    Dillinger'll never know we've been in
                    here...

         from the rotating security camera outside the elevator on the floor
         of the laser lab. We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera.
         His head pulls back in.


    113  SHOT OF HALLWAY                                              113


         As the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora
         make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching.


    114  INT. DOORWAY TO LASER LAB - POV OF MCP                       114


         from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab. We see Flynn
         approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
         his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
         camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,


    115  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   115


         Alan comes into his office and sits at his terminal.

         Lora watches as Flynn sits down at her terminal.


                               LORA
                    This laser's my life's work.
                    Don't spill anything.


         Flynn LAUGHS as Lora goes out.


    120  CLOSE SHOT OF FLYNN                                          120

         settling in, loosening his fingers, like a concert pianist, or a
         safecracker. He types in a code number, presses the "enter" key.

         It clears abruptly, and the following appears as we hear the VOICE
         of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey hey, it's that big Master Control

                    I'm afraid you...


         The voice lurches, goes into high speed, and then back to normal.


                               MCP
                          (continuing;
                         slightly shaken)
                    Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this.

         We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising
         silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.


         We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
         is this section that is being activated.

         grinning, typing.


                               FLYNN
                    Now, how do you expect to run the
                    universe if you let a few unsolvable
                    problems throw you like that? C'mon,
                    big boy, let's see what...


                               MCP
                    You're entering a big error, Flynn...
                    I'm going to have to put you on the
                    Game Grid.


                               FLYNN
                    Games, huh? I'll give you --


         Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
         behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
         freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
         a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
         ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
         being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
         with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
         blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129
         we saw at the opening of the film'.


         The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
         rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
         getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
         glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
         covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
         closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
         with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
         angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
         deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
         an internal energy.


         We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
         structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
         and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
         everything blurring with the speed.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    130  ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL                                  130


         made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    131  THIS TUNNEL                                                  131


         We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the
         outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops,
         staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.


                                                   CUT TO:


    132  SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL                             132


         We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now
         covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry,
         glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
                    thinks it's happening...


         He looks up and SEES something.


    133  FLYNN'S POV                                                  133


         A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,
         is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and
         grabs Flynn.


                                                   CUT TO:

         being dragged off the entry tube platform.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is
                    about those parking tickets, I can
                    explain everything...


    135  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           135


         hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his
         hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
         fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
         into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the
         cylinder of the MCP.

                    SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.


         Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.

                    Yes, MCP.


                               MCP
                    I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
                    a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
                    want him treated in the usual manner. Train
                    him for the games... let him hope for a
                    while... and blow him away.


                               SARK
                    You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
                    me somebody with a little moxie ... what
                    kind of program is he?


                               MCP
                    He's not any kind of program, Sark.
                    He's a User.


         Sark looks up, shocked.


                               SARK
                    A User?


                               MCP
                    That's right. He pushed me...in the
                    other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
                    back. So I brought him down here ...
                    What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.



                               SARK
                    Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
                    a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
                    even wrote you...


                               MCP
                    Now get this straight, pal -- no one
                    User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
                    of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
                    those little wimps put together!
                            (disgust)
                    Humans they can't even keen their social
                    order in one piece

                               SARK
                    But-what if I can't...?


                               MCP
                    You rather take your chances with me?
                    Want me to slow down your power cycles
                    for you?


         The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.


                               SARK
                    Wait...I need that...


                               MCP
                    Then pull yourself together. Get this
                    clown trained. I want him in the Games
                    until he dies playing.

                    Acknowledge.


                               SARK
                             (weakly)
                    Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.

    136  INT. CORRIDOR BENEATH GAME GRID                              136


         Two guards leading Flynn down it, ECHOING FOOTSTEPS.


         They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a
         cell. The door opens automatically. Flynn holds back.


                               GUARD
                    Video Game Unit #18. In here, program.


                               FLYNN
                           (trying to grab
                           the guard's arm)
                    Who you callin' "program," program?


         The guard shoves Flynn inside and SLAMS the door, cutting off his
         voice.


    137  INT. CELL                                                    137


         The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence.
         Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands.


    138  HIS POV                                                      138


         Flynn's hands are glowing, electrified.


    139  CLOSE SHOT                                                   139


         of his face. His head comes up and we see an expression of terrible
         understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening
         of the neighboring cell.


    140  INT. NEXT CELL - RAM'S                                       140


         Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's.


                               RAM
                          (looking over
                          his shoulder)
                    New guy...


                               TRON
                         (shakes his head)
                    Another free program off line.  What's
                    his User s'posed to do -- ?

                    They'd better be...I don't want to bust
                    outta this dump an' find nothin' but
                    a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.


    141  FLYNN'S CELL                                                 141


         He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
         so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Who are you guys?
                    What's the story around here?


         But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
         it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
         come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
         disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.


    142  RAM                                                          142


         turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.


                               RAM
                    You want to watch those force fields...


         He goes to the window opening.


                               RAM (CONT.)
                    You'll be having plenty of chances to
                    get hurt, don't worry about that.


                               FLYNN
                    Look...just so I can tell my friends
                    what this dream was about, okay?
                    Where am I?


                               RAM
                    You're a..."guest" of the Master Control
                    Program. They're going to make you play
                    video games.


                               FLYNN
                             (relieved)
                    Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
                    video games better than anybody.


         Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
         there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
         opens.


    143  THE CORRIDOR                                                 143


         we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as
         Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
         opposite direction.


                                                   CUT TO:


    144  TRAINING ARENA                                               144


         A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
         balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
         hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
         captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
         pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of
         them. Flynn is in the front of the line.


                               HEAD GUARD

         Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is
         amplified over the grid.

         for a rest period. He is pacing back and forth, and we can see Ram
         seated in the next cell. Flynn goes to the bars.

                    worked at a big insurance company.

         We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's
         console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous,
         frightened of this new User-warrior.

    189  A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM                       189


         We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
         bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
         circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
         marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
         When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
         We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
         and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
         looks over at Crom, who's anxious.


                               FLYNN
                    Looks like we're in the same boat here -

                    out, don't you?


                               FLYNN
                    No, I


         A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
         upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
         straight for Flynn.


         Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
         his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
         right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
         himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.


    190  FLYNN'S POV - DOWN                                           190

         down, down between the rings into an infinite pit.


    191  BACK TO FLYNN                                                191

         staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up.

    192  HIS POV                                                      192


         Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


    193  FLYNN                                                        193


         reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther
         edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and
         catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back.


    194  CROM                                                         194


         Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains,
         but misses. One of his rings disappears.

    195  FLYNN reacting                                               195


                               FLYNN
                       (happy he's scored)
                    Okay!

    196  SARK'S AIRCRAFT CARRIER - THE BRIDGE                         196

         High above the game we see Sark watching.


    197  FLYNN                                                        197


         racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again.
         We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast.


    198  OMIT                                                         198

    199  THE GAME IN PROGRESS                                         199


                               FLYNN
                    Here's an easy one...


         Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads
         straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he
         was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of
         the next ring to keep from falling.


 200-201 OMIT                                                         200-201


    202  FLYNN                                                        202


         He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it
         ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.


    203  SARK                                                         203


         His face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid... angry


    204  FLYNN                                                        204


         He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above.
         Flynn looks up. There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's
         face, furious, huge.


                               SARK
                    Finish the game!


    205  FLYNN                                                        205


         staring at this apparition. He grits his teeth.


                               FLYNN
                            (shouts up)
                    No!


    205A REAL WORLD - A BUS STATION                                   205A


         In a Greyhound station waiting area, two kids are playing a video
         game, which appears to have broken down.


                               KID
                    What's wrong with it?


                               KID 2
                    I don't know... on the blink
                    or something... damn.

    205B ELECTRONIC WORLD - FLYNN, SARK, ETC. AS BEFORE               205B


                               SARK
                    Kill him!!!


         Flynn holds up the pellet... and drops it down into the abyss below.
         He stares back up at Sark's immense image.


                               FLYNN
                    No!


    206  SARK'S HUGE REFLECTED IMAGE                                  206


         in the mirror platform, towering above Flynn.


                               SARK
                    You'll regret this.

    207  SARK'S FINGER                                                207


         pressing a button.


    208  CROM                                                         208


         The ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a SCREAM, he
         falls... and falls ... and falls...


    209  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        209

         with Flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of Sark above
         him.

    210  SARK                                                         210


         on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost
         presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his
         conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.


                               SARK
                           (looking up)
                    No! You said he could die in the games

    211  FLYNN                                                        211

         staring up. The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves.


    212  SARK                                                         212


         He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER
         SOUNDS.


    213  FLYNN                                                        213


         as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting
         to run across to him.


    214  RAM AND TRON                                                 214


         The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells. They look
         up.


    215  A CORRIDOR IN THE GAME AREA                                  215


         Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by
         and deliberately brush into Flynn.

                               WARRIOR
                          (turning on Flynn,
                              snarling)
                    Outta  my way, rookie.


         Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
         and pulls out his disk.


                               FLYNN
                    Out of my way, zero bit.


         He moves as if to throw the disk.


                               WARRIOR
                            (backing away)
                    Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.


         The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as
         Flynn and his guards continue on.


    216  THE HOLDING AREA FOR THE LIGHT CYCLE GAME                    216


         Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another
         corridor. Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.


                               RAM
                    Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!


                               FLYNN
                         (under his breath)
                    Tron...?


         He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.

                               FLYNN
                    Alan!

                               TRON
                            (frowning)
                    Where did you hear that name?


                               FLYNN
                    Well, isn't it -- ?


                               TRON
                    The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?


                               FLYNN
                          (thinking fast)
                    I, uh... I'm a program from a User
                    that... knows Alan...?


                               RAM
                    He was disoriented in transport, Tron.


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
                    stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
                    after the MCP


         Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.


                                                   CUT TO:


    217  LONG SHOT OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                            217


         floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena.
         ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.


    218  A SHOT FROM ABOVE                                            218


         The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
         sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
         high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
         hovering high overhead.


    219  CLOSE ON TRON                                                219


                               TRON
                    That's what my User wants, too...


    220  SHOT OF THE THREE FRIENDS                                    220


         holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron
         and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.


                               FLYNN
                    I know...


    221  CLOSE SHOT - FLYNN                                           221


         With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed
         around him.


    222  SHOT OF THE THREE BLUE CYCLES                                222


         ready to go.


    223  SHOT OF THE THREE CONSCRIPT CYCLES                           223


         also ready.


    224  SARK                                                         224


         His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again.


    225  SHOT FROM ABOVE OF ALL CYCLES TAKING OFF                     225


         We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we
         watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
         and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:


    226  OMIT                                                         226


    227  TRON'S POV                                                   227


         of the other cycle heading straight at him.


    228  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              228


         We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
         turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
         forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
         arena.


                               FLYNN'S VOICE
                                (into mike)
                    Nice one!


    229  SHOT OF TRON AND HIS OPPONENT                                229


         They start making turns, passing walls they have already created,
         each trying to box the other in.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    Ram, stay all the way over ...


    230  CLOSE SHOT FROM THE SIDE - TRON                              230

         rushing forward.


    231  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           231

         turning.

                               RAM'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    I've got control. Go ahead.


    232  SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON'S CYCLE                           232


    233  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              233

         They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
         the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
         inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
         There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
         the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
         dissolve as he does.

    234  SHOT OF FLYNN                                                234

         rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn.

         They make another turn


    237  SHOT OF TWO CYCLES RUSHING                                   237

         right at the camera.

         of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack
         in the bulwark.

    239  CLOSE UP - HIS FACE                                          239

         reacting, getting an idea.

                               FLYNN
                            (into mike)
                    You guys...follow me.


    240  SHOT OF THE TWO CYCLES                                       240


         racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the
         Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack.


    241  SARK                                                         241


         observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User.


    242  FLYNN                                                        242


         He races straight at the crack... and through it.


    243  SARK                                                         243


         His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console
         in front of him.

         The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena.


    245  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              245


         reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.

         SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns
         and races up next to Tron.

         side by side. They look at each other.

         We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We
         HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:


                               VOICE
                      (through loudspeaker)
                    WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
                    REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
                    GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.


         We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually
         diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies
         out altogether.

    250  SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES                            250


         racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room
         to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers
         appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA...

         to come down for the kill.

         heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage."

         as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
         way too big to fit through the opening.

    254  INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       254


         FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
         rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
         REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
         and follow.

         Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
         Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
         narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
         ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
         around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
         face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.

         as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the
         narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing
         from view.

    258  INT. OF THE CAVE                                             258


         We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
         darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
         stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
         between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh man...when you're on the other side
                    of the screen...it all looks so easy...


         Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
         grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.

         carrier hovering overhead.

                    There's no place else they could be...


         Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
         where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
         moving through it. He turns to Sark.


                               LIEUTENANT
                              (confidently)

    261  INT. CAVE                                                    261


         Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
         cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
         cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
         from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.


                               FLYNN
                           (looking out)
                    It's all circuits...
                         (points at tower)
                    Must be an input/output component...


                               RAM
                    The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
                    remembered anything else about
                    yourself -- like what sector you're
                    from?


                               FLYNN
                           (sitting down
                          against a rock)
                    Well...my home "sector" was called
                    Paramus ...


                               RAM
                           (sits also)
                    PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
                    stand for ... (starts counting them
                    off on his fingers) ...probably Program
                    Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
                    a lovely place.


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    It grows on you.


         He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
         gazing upwards.


                               TRON
                            (murmuring)
                    I can feel it ...


         Flynn and Ram turn.


                               FLYNN
                    Feel what? You okay?

                    Yes... he's got something to tell me...


         Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.


                               RAM
                    You think we can make it there?


                               TRON
                    We have to.


                               FLYNN
                      (pointing to a corner
                           of the cave)
                    Hey, what's that?


         They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
         can just be seen. Ram gets up.


                               RAM
                    it's just what we need.


    262  INT. NICHE                                                   262


         Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
         brilliant LIGHT.


                               TRON
                    Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
                    good fresh energy feels, till you get
                    to a pure source...
                            (to Flynn)
                    Have some...you'll need it.


         Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.


                               FLYNN
                         (wiping his mouth)
                    well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
                    Master Control?


         Tron and Ram are taken aback.


                               TRON
                    What, just the three of us?


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    You know anybody that's got an army for
                    rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
                    to go take that sucker out. An' let's
                    face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
                    weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
                    while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
                    what does he care whether you guys get
                    killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
                    quarters?


                               RAM
                            (to Tron)
                    Do you know what he's talking about?


                               TRON
                            (to Flynn)
                    I have to find out what Alan wants...
                    that comes first.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
                    what to -


         Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    What's that?


                               TRON
                    Tanks...coming back. Let's go.


         With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
         men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
         into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.


 263-265 OMIT                                                         263-265

         The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
         avenues of escape in the terrain below.


                               FLYNN
                              (points)
                    How about over there...that empty
                    memory?


                               TRON
                           (shakes head)
                    No good...they might block off the
                    old chip.
                             (points)
                    This way.


         The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
         the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
         EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.

         from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
         arroyo.


    268  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           268


         They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
         entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
         narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
         to the edge of a gaping ravine.


         Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
         ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
         to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                    The bridge! Come on!


         The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
         lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
         three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
         turning the corner.

    270  SHOT OF THE BRIDGE                                           270


         Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
         the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
         tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
         him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
         and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
         SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.


         He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
         below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.


         The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
         speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

         Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet,
         sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him
         up.


    274  SHOT OF FLYNN                                                274


         struggling with Ram's limp body, wedging himself into a narrow crack.

         in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
         behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
         the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
         blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
         lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.


                               SARK
                         (to lieutenant)

                    he'll be pleased to hear we're all
                    finished with that User he sent us.


    276  EXT. DESERT - TRON'S CYCLE                                   276

         speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
         the cityscape tower in the distance.

    277  SHOT IN FRONT OF HIM - HIS FACE                              277

         Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
         moving in his direction.

                                                   CUT TO:

    278  FLYNN AND RAM                                                278


         Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
         getting darker.


                               FLYNN
                    You gonna make it?


         Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
         lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
         leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
         out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:

         arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening.
         Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
         and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.

    280  FLYNN AND RAM                                                280


         sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious
         anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.


                                                   FADE TO BLACK:
    281  FADE UP FROM BLACK                                           281


         Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
         platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
         Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
         then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
         looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
         the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
         glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
         it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
         RUMBLE.


                               FLYNN
                           (holding onto
                             the wall)
                    What's goin' on?


                               RAM
                      (looking around, weak)
                    We're inside a Recognizer...
                            (to Flynn)
                    You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --


                               FLYNN
                       (stumbling, trying to
                         keep his balance)
                    Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -


         Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
         instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
         shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
         Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
         position.


                                                   CUT TO:

         as it stands up, covered with a static overlay, partially de-rezzed.


    283  INT. RECOGNIZER                                              283


         Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.


         Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
         going fast.


                               FLYNN
                    You okay? You don't look so good.


         Ram nods weakly.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Hang on. We'll get you outta here.


         Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
         no result.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Damn! Never fails... minute the
                    warranty runs out...


                               RAM
                    Come here.


         Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
         Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
         Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... !


                               RAM
                    Little more juice's all it needs...


         Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
         Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
         but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
         gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    284  THE CITY LANDSCAPE                                           284


         Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
         landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
         rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
         NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.


    285  TRON'S POV                                                   285


         A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.


    286  EXT. CITY LANDSCAPE                                          286

         He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
         figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
         it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
         figure, dissolving it.


    287  CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE                                         287


         Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
         figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
         Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
         at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
         head sadly, but walks on.


    288  TRON TURNS A CORNER                                          288


         Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building.


    289  CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE                                      289

         This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side,
         figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
         building stand a small group of the memory guards.

         Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.

         Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.

         This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
         sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
         then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
         One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
         gives a violent shake, then stops.


                               FLYNN
                    Never gonna figure out how to work
                    this thing...


         There's a NOISE from above. He looks up.


    293  HIS POV                                                      293


         We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment.


    294  FLYNN                                                        294


         His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
         to be still examining things.


                                                   CUT TO:

         Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
         to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.


    296  WIDE SHOT                                                    296


         Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
         a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
         comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay -- hold it right there!


         The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
         recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
         sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:


                               BIT
                    Yes!


         The Bit subsides into energy form again.


                               FLYNN
                        (still suspicious)
                    What do you mean, "'yes"?


                               BIT
                    Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.


         From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
         red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
         speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.


                               FLYNN
                    That all you can say?


                               BIT
                         (of course not,
                         you know better)
                    No, nyet, negatory, not on your
                    tintype, no way.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh. Anything else?


                               BIT
                    Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.

                    only yes and no...
                             (it dawns)
                    You're a bit.

                    where's your program? Won't it miss you?


                               BIT
                            (confused)
                    No...


         Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm your program?


                               BIT
                            (emphatic)
                    Right on the money!

                    Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
                    chance know how to drive this crate?


         In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
         platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
         stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
         grabs the cross-bar.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Like so?


         Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
         and it takes off like a bat out of hell


 297-298 OMIT                                                         297-298

         into a wall and bouncing off another one.

         This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
         inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
         of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
         elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
         partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
         We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
         only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
         interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
         Tron looks farther down the corridor.

         We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
         Tron.

         as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.


         As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
         grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
         The line of workers mechanically files on past.


         We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
         his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
         half-heartedly.


                               TRON
                    I'm not gonna hurt you.


         She stops struggling.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    I'm going to let you go now... don't
                    scream, or I'll be very sorry.


         His hands loosen, and he releases her.

    306  SHOT FROM IN FRONT                                           306


         We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first
         time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,
         still beautiful in its pallor.


                               TRON
                    Put your hand behind your back.


         Slowly she obeys.


    307  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              307


         A slow smile appears on his face.


    308  SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                            308


         He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
         made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
         watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
         her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.


                               GIRL
                    TRON!!


         She throws her arms around him.


                               TRON
                        (smiling, hugging
                           her tightly)
                    Yori... hey...


                               YORI
                    Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape...
                    they've never built circuit that could
                    hold you...


         She-looks around nervously.


                               YORI
                          (pulling him by
                             his hand)
                    This way. Come on.


         They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.

         Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
         the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
         and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
         hear snatches of conversation.


                               PROGRAM
                    ...artillery for Video Game Sector...

                    ...all mathematical functions
                    transferred to...


                               YORI
                    I can't believe how bad it's gotten
                    around here since the MCP started
                    taking over... all the good functions
                    have shut down... everybody looks so dead...
                    I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...


                               TRON
                    That's all going to change, Yori...


                               YORI
                    How?


                               TRON
                    Don't know yet... I have to get
                    in touch with Alan. He was going
                    to tell me how to


         Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls
         him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.

         She shivers, and holds Tron's hand tighter.

    313  INT. HALLWAYS                                                313


         Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
         She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.


                                                   CUT TO:


    314  INT. YORI'S APARTMENT                                        314


         As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
         window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
         looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
         walls and floors.

                               YORI
                    My quarters.

                               TRON
                    Why is everything...like this?


                               YORI
                    It's a flat. But wait a micro...


         She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
         a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
         the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
         three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
         charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
         the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
         aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.


    315  HIS POV                                                      315


         With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
         extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
         shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
         diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
         her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
         by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
         Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.


                               YORI
                    Come here.


    316  TRON                                                         316


         His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
         being fully rewarded for his efforts.


                               TRON
                    You're beautiful, Yori.


    317  SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                            317

         as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
         flattened palms.


         Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
         glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.


                               YORI
                    You've grown, big program.


                               TRON
                    I had to...in the games...


         They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
         the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
         what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
         room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
         other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
         moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
         trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
         are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

         ZOOM OUT past the carrier towards the landscape beyond.

         A slightly out-of-control Recognizer arrives in the city, wobbling,
         careening, glancing off a building or two.

         Flynn is having trouble controlling the Reco.


                               FLYNN
                    This honey doesn't handle so good

         He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
         light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
         only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
         shouting:


                               BIT
                    Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -


         Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that
         he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.


                               BIT
                           (that's more

         as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it,
         with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air,
         landing in what looks like a garbage dump.

         as Flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris, the Bit nervously
         hovering over him.


                               FLYNN

         A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
         from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
         his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
         they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
         him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
                    Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
                    for your concern. So long.


         They move on.

         Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
         the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
         bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.

         It looms high overhead.

         on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
         approaching a wide door in the wall.


    331  INSIDE THIS DOOR'                                            331


         We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
         rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
         and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.


    332  SHOT FROM BELOW THEM                                         332

         as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and
         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
         and beyond.


         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.

         wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.


         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
         only blackness beyond.


    351  DUMONT'S FACE                                                351

         room, their footsteps ECHOING.

    375  CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT                         375

         Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.

                             (quietly)
                    Dumont... ?


         The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
         recognize either one.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes?

                    Hmm. A difficult proposition...
                    difficult proposition at best.
                       (indicates empty chamber)
                    Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
                    exactly packing them in these days ...


                               YORI
                    Yes...what--?


                               DUMONT
                    You know, not so long ago, you
                    could've come in here and seen
                    programs lined up all the way back
                    to those doors, waiting for communion
                    with their Users. The building fund
                    was doing well too...but now...
                               (sighs)
                    ...this so-called Master Control
                    Program is going around cutting
                    programs off from their natural
                    creators, grabbing all our believers
                    and making them ride around on little
                    motor scooters and shoot things at
                    each other and Weiner knows what all--
                    oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
                    of faith...


                               TRON
                    Well I want to communicate --

                               DUMONT
                    Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
                    get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
                    you in here. They hate this tower.
                    They'd close it down if they dared
                    to but they keep me around, in case
                    one of them wants to deal with the
                    other world once in a while. And
                    you should hear the way they commune!
                    Sounds like they were routing a
                    payroll, for all the heart they put
                    in it. No, I don't think you


         Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.


                               TRON
                    Dumont... my User has information
                    that could -- could make this a
                    free system again.


                               DUMONT
                    Hah.


                               TRON
                    Really. You'd have programs lined
                    up around the block to use this
                    place -- and no MCP looking over your
                    shoulder.


                               DUMONT
                               (sighs)
                    When you've been in the system as long
                    as I have, you hear many promises...
                    many reassurances...many brave plans...


         He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:


                               DUMONT (CONT.)
                           (falling into ritual)
                    Who is your User, program?


                               TRON
                    Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?


                               DUMONT
                    All that is visible must grow beyond
                    itself and extend into the realm of
                    the invisible.


         Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.


                               DUMONT
                    You may pass, my friend.


         Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness
         beyond.

         We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring
         curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.

         We see a face peer around it. Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    This is where Tron said he was going...


         Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
         the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
         down the hall, Bit following.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Looks like his kind of place, too...
                    real serious.


         CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
         the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
         corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

         Sark... and a force of guards and six Blue Warriors. Sark is in
         front, enjoyment on his face. As far as he's concerned he's just
         going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is
         trapped.

         seen. Sark marches TOWARDS THE CAMERA, right into it.

         The file of men is moving away. We can see that there is a wide ledge
         about ten feet up the wall, containing the lighting source.

         lifting his staff.

         Flynn looks up AT THE CAMERA, finger to his lips.

         We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning
         over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
         places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue
         static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his
         arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes.

         I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and
         Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.


                               SARK
                    That old fruitcake Dumont...
                    he'll pay for this.

    392  THE HEART OF THE TOWER                                       392


         We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
         golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
         surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
         Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.


    393  INT. COMMUNICATION BELL                                      393


         Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
         which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
         sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
         surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
         this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
         within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
         down, and then up.


    394  HIS POV                                                      394


         The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.


    395  FROM THE OPENING                                             395


         We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
         into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
         inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
         above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
         his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
         knowledge of the experience to come.


    396  A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.            396


         He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
         high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
         happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
         light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
         illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
         force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
         from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
         of the light.


    397  TRON'S FACE FROM ABOVE                                       397

         hands drop to his sides. The disk rises out of sight, and we

    399  EXT. CENTRAL CHAMBER - DOOR                                  399


         A machine, floating above the floor, with a pointed cone facing the
         door, is switched on, and a blast of pure electricity leaps from it
         to the surface of the door with the SOUND of sizzling LIGHTNING

         Tron is looking upwards. Suddenly a voice booms out, echoing, and
         distorted, Alan's voice.


                               ALAN V.0.
                    TRON... TRON... Location query...

         In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
         transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
         at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
         bright light at the center.


         We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the
         others dim.

         The light increases in brilliance, as we hear Alan's voice fading out,
         consumed by static.

         He stops.


         The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and
         gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It
         slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it,
         pulls it down and stares at it.

         It is glowing with a new power. Superimposed on its surface is a
         complex mandala pattern, changing kaleidoscopically as we watch,
         shifting swirling liquid color.

         Almost gone. We can hear the voices of Sark's men outside.


                               YORI (V.0.)
                    Dumont! The door...

         turning back to Dumont. Behind Dumont stands Tron, framed in the
         entry to the Communication chamber.

    410  SHOT OF DUMONT                                               410


         He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the
         neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he
         has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming
         winglike supports for the fabric.


                               DUMONT
                    I have waited for this moment many
                    thousands of cycles. It is time for the
                    new order to begin... The Users are
                    waiting.


         As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly.
         Then he holds out his hand to Yori.


    411  LONG SHOT as Yori steps forward up the steps.                411

         We see it is almost transparent, and as we watch, there is a burst
         of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots
         of light.

         Sark.

         We see Dumont standing on the top of the steps, no sign of Tron and
         Yori. The guards spread out through the room, Sark strides towards
         Dumont.


                               SARK
                    Where's the program?

         As Tron and Yori race across the floor.


                               YORI (V.0.)
                    This way...there's a simulation
                    we can use...


         And we see them race towards it.


    418  SHOT OF THEM RISING ON AN ELEVATOR PLATFORM, FROM            419
         ABOVE, LOOKING DOWN AT THEM.

    419  A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON         419
         AND YORI

         We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
         designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
         enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
         move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft,
         and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
         made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
         look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
         transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
         information paths to the Central Processing Unit.

                               TRON V.O.
                    Can it carry us?


                               YORI V.0.
                    The design is good... We don't know
                    why the User abandoned the project...


         The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
         forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
         into place.


    420  SHOT OF THEM FROM THE LONG WALKWAY, FACING THE STERN         420


         We see Yori bending over a console of touch panels.


                               YORI
                    Yes...it can take us across the
                    Sea of Simulation... all the way
                    out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.


                               TRON

                            of hangar)

         The crowd of Sark's men are racing towards it.

    422  EXT. SOLAR SAILER DECK - TRON AND YORI                       422


         Bending over the console, from the POV of the sail. As we watch, a
         head leans into the frame from the right. A memory guard. Then we
         see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the
         left.


                                                   CUT TO:


    423  THE TWO OF THEM FROM A LOW ANGLE                             423


         On the console, as Yori leans over it. We see that she is looking at
         a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the
         beam transfer points and transmission location.


                                                   CUT TO:


    424  THE TWO GUARDS, CREEPING DOWN THE WALKWAY                    424


         silently. We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise. His head snaps
         up; he sees the guards.


                               TRON
                    Yori! Get down!


    425  THE GUARDS                                                   425


         Abandoning any attempt at silence, leap forward, shouting, thrusting
         their staffs at Tron.

         and slashes the second across the face, knocking him out.

         As Sark's men rush in and head for the stairs to the catwalks that
         ring the hangar walls. They start swarming up.

    430  WALKWAY OF SAILER                                            430


         as guards start swarming on board. We see Tron move forward and then
         stop, letting them come.

         looking down at the walkway. Beyond it we can see the great door
         starting to rise.

    432  TRON                                                         432


         throwing his disk. It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them
         backwards.


                                                   CUT TO:


    433  A SHOT FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE HANGAR                       433


         The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with
         its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
         racing towards the hangar.


    434  TRON                                                         434


         Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
         We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
         connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
         guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
         There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
         his balance.


    435  YORI                                                         435


         smiling.


                               YORI
                    We're off!


    436  EXT. HANGAR                                                  436


         The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
         from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
         it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
         accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
         seconds.


    437  EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - BRIDGE - SARK & MCP                  437

         Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
         front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
         the Solar Sailer -- racing away.


                               MCP
                    I hope you've enjoyed being a command
                    program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
                    working in a pocket calculator... maybe
                    one of those watches that plays "Happy
                    Birthday" to its User once a year.


                               SARK
                    Now, sir... We did take care of that
                    User you sent us --


                               MCP
                    Yes, and now you've got two renegade
                    programs running all the hell over the
                    system in a stolen simulation.


                               SARK
                    We'll get them, sir... These things
                    take time.


                               MCP
                    I don't have time, Sark. And neither
                    do you. End of line.

         from the stern. Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was
         thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera).
         He stops, seeing something.


                               YORI V.O.
                    Tron, are you all right?


         Tron waves at her... then...


    441  CLOSE SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON                             441


         He looks over at the guard rail.

         Several yards away from it. We see one of the blue warriors hanging
         on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the
         edge, look over and see this guard.


    444  CLOSE SHOT OF TRON                                           444


         By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his
         disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing
         shape comes into the frame from bottom right.

                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, I... oops!


         He loses his grip, and starts to fall. But Tron, just in time, grabs
         Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up. We see the blue static guard
         disguise fade off Flynn.


    449  YORI                                                         449

         leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up
         the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit.

         We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise...
         but then realize his mistake.

                               FLYNN
                    I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
                    he didn't make it.


         Tron shakes his head, sadly.


                               TRON
                             (to Yori)
                    This is Flynn... the one who
                    busted me out.


                               YORI
                            (to Flynn)
                    Then I owe you some thanks...


                               FLYNN
                    No big deal. I ought to know my way
                    around that Light Cycles routine...
                    I mean, I did write the program for it.


                               TRON
                            (mystified)
                    Wrote the...?


                               FLYNN
                    It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
                    I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
                    User.


         Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.


                               YORI
                    A User -- in our world?


                               FLYNN
                               (nods)
                    Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...


                               TRON
                    But -- if you're a User -- then
                    everything you've done has been
                    part of a plan ...


                               FLYNN
                              (laughs)
                    You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
                    to think since I got down here. I mean
                    in here. Out here. Whatever.


                               TRON
                    Then...


                               FLYNN
                    Look, you guys know how it is. You just
                    keep doin' what it looks like you're
                    supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
                    you hope to hell your User knows what's
                    goin' on.


                               TRON
                    Well -- that's how it is for programs,
                    yes, but --


                               FLYNN
                    I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
                    time, that's how it is for Users, too.


                               TRON
                    Stranger and stranger...


                               BIT
                    You said it.


                               FLYNN
                        (pats Tron on back)
                    So... Nice ship you got here. What's our
                    next move?


                               TRON
                             (smiles)
                    Remember you wanted to pay a call on
                    the MCP?


         Flynn nods.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    We're on our way.
                             (indicates disk)
                    Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go
                    up against Master

                               FLYNN
                    All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,
                    at least.

         The aircraft carrier rolls past the camera.

    452  THE BRIDGE - SARK                                            452


         looking out the observation window, as his lieutenant approaches
         from behind.

                               LIEUTENANT
                    Sir, what do you want done with
                    the tower guardian, Dumont?
                    Put him with the others?


                               SARK
                    No, bit brain.

         Sark turns to face him.


                               SARK


                    Prepare him for inquisition. I need
                    a little relaxation. But first rez up
                    the carrier for pursuit... And one other
                    thing.


         lie stares at the lieutenant, paranoid


                               SARK
                           (continuing)
                    Don'tthink anymore. I do the
                   thinkingaround here.

         We see Flynn looking back the way they came. Yori is at the controls,
         with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                    What about our friend - Sark?


                               TRON
                    Probably decided not to pursue us,
                    The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
                    lot of illusions...rough navigating.
                    Programs have a way of just...
                    disappearing here.

                               FLYNN
                    Not us, I hope.


                               TRON
                         (shakes his head,
                          indicates disk)
                    Not with this disk. I'm going to
                    check on the beam connection, Yori.
                    You two can keep a watch out for
                    grid bugs.


         He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following. Flynn turns and
         leans out over the side.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy the view from up here... you
                    know the territory?


                               YORI
                    A little ...
                       (points out sights)
                    Over there, the Mountains of Data...
                    and I think that's the Silicon Valley...


                               FLYNN
                             (pointing)
                    What's wrong with that area?

         We see an area of darkened, gloomy, two-dimensional shapes.


                               YORI
                              (sadly)
                    The MCP blasted it... There are very
                    few domains left with any power at all.


                               FLYNN
                    Lousy utility companies ...
                    they're the same wherever you go.

         Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets. Two memory
         guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
         Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
         expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
         torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA
         PULLS BACK AND ANGLES UP to the second level where we see Sark
         looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell.

                    Busy dying, you worn-out excuse for
                    an old program.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes, I'm old.

                               DUMONT
                            (continuing)
                    Old enough to remember the MCP when he
                    was just a chess program. He started
                    small, and he'll end small.

                         head and laughs)
                    That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I
                    should keep you around, just to make me
                    laugh.

                    Guards! Bring this antique to the

         We see Tron at the bow. Flynn and Yori are up on the deck near the
         controls, with the Bit hovering over them. Yori is, pointing
         something out to Flynn.

         We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer
         increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing
         energy, coming towards the ship. It hits the sail, and the ship
         shivers. The whole beam is now tripled in brightness.

         against him... they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the
         increasing beam.

         Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and
         races forward.

         raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but
         too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same
         intensity as the beam.


                                                   CUT TO:


    481  TRON AND YORI                                                481


         Shielding their eyes from the light.

    482  SHOT FROM ABOVE FLYNN                                        482


         His body glowing, arm outstretched. Suddenly another beam blasts out
         from his arm.


                                                   CUT TO:


    483  LONG SHOT                                                    483


         We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring
         transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then
         breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting
         to the safe beam.

         The craft starts to travel safely on its way.


                                                   CUT TO:

         Tron races down the walkway toward Flynn, closely followed by Yori
         and the Bit.

         Carrying Flynn towards the stern, carefully, gingerly with Yori
         watching.

         as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can
         see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a
         moment, dazed.

                               FLYNN
                              (weakly)
                    Did we make it?

                               TRON
                    Yes.


         Flynn smiles weakly.


                               FLYNN
                    Hooray for our side...


         He faints.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    488  A WATERY, WAVERING VIEW OF YORI                              488


         Her face, upside-down, peering downward.


    489  SOLAR SAILER - TRON, FLYNN, YORI                             489


         Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn
         stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on
         either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit
         is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer
         is passing through a series of narrow canyons.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... you guys OK?


                               TRON
                              (nods)
                    How about you?


                               FLYNN
                    Aah, I'm fine... little hung over
                    is all...


                               YORI
                    How did you do that, Flynn?


                               FLYNN
                            (sitting up)
                    Elementary physics... a beam of
                    energy can always be diverted...

                              to Yori)
                    Are we there yet, Mommy?


                               YORI
                    Almost... I just have to adjust our
                    course at the next junction. I'd better
                    go check the instruments ...


         She heads O.S., toward the bow.


    490  LONG SHOT                                                    490


         The Sailer is about to pass the mouth of another canyon.

         Tron looks away from Flynn for a moment to check the Sailer's
         progress.

         as the new canyon comes into sight. CAMERA LOOKS UP AND UP... to the
         immense bulk of the aircraft carrier, moving fast toward the Sailer.

         The carrier lurches forward and rams the Sailer, splitting it in
         half.

         Falling on top of one another, Flynn trying to pull Yori out of the
         way as the bulk of the carrier appears to slam into Tron and he's
         gone.

         falling through space.

         As the carrier keeps moving forward. Flynn holding Yori, and the Bit
         hovers beside them. A second level of the carrier, with an open hold,
         comes rushing at them.

         The gaping hold rushes forward and the screen goes black.

         Their half of the Sailer is scooped up into the carrier.

         catching hold of something. He is swinging freely. Hanging onto a
         wall, he starts pulling his feet up to gain a precarious foothold.

         inside the door, shoulders slumped and we can see that his disk has
         been removed.

         Dumont holds Yori as she SOBS.


                               DUMONT
                    Quietly, Yori...


         He looks up.


                               DUMONT
                            (continuing)
                    Tron... ?


         Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the
         wall.


                               YORI
                    He's dead.


                               DUMONT
                           (sighs, looks
                             at Flynn)
                    And who is this?


                               YORI
                    He's a User, Dumont. He came to
                    our world... trying to help us...


         Her voice breaks, she turns away.


                               DUMONT
                            (despairing)
                    If the Users can no longer help us...


         His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the
         cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the
         cell door.


                               SARK
                    So... we have erased the program that -


         As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You! No!


         Flynn looks up curiously.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You died! I saw you!


                               FLYNN
                    Not me, boss.


                               SARK
                    Well... we can take care of that
                    soon enough.


         He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    Take this program to the holding pit.


         The guards start to drag Dumont out.

                    Dumont...!


         A guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell.

                        (indicates Dumont)
                    I'm taking our friend here, and
                    some other religious fanatics, to
                    Master Control... the MCP has expressed
                    an interest in assimilating them --
                    probably for archival purposes.
                    I'm not going back to the Game Grid
                    on this ship, though -- I'll take
                    the Transport Beam.
                             (smiles)
                    Less traffic. But when I disembark,
                    this ship...and everything that remains
                    on board...will automatically de-rez.
                    This means you.

                    Enjoy your trip...


         LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow.


    533  SHOT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PIT CELLS                         533


         into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs,
         the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards
         beginning to herd them out.

         into the cells at his feet and laughs again.

         As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the
         carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up
         speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck
         clinging to one side of the pod...

         TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack.


    544  FLYNN, YORI AND THE BIT                                      544


         Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door
         testing it, running his finger along the edges.

         Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more

         tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for
         landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
         shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes,
         fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
         structure.

         There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
         the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
         Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
         gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
         the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
         black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
         rises out of the center of this cylinder.

         floating upwards and forward.

         Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the
         door.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


         The door is disappearing, dissolving.


                               FLYNN
                       (continuing; turning)
                    Look, the door's almost...


         He stops in horror.


                                                   CUT TO:


    552  HIS POV                                                      552


         Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them.
         She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks
         up dimly at Flynn, with no expression.


    553  WIDE SHOT                                                    553


         Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging
         her close, his energy flowing into her.


         Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is
         too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.


                               FLYNN
                    Yori!


    554  CLOSE SHOT                                                   554


         Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
         Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
         floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
         Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.


                               YORI
                             (in awe)
                    You... you brought me back...?
                    Why...? How ... ?


         Flynn lets go of her.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!


         He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
         to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
         Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
         Suddenly the Bit pops into life.


                               BIT
                    Yes!


                               FLYNN
                    Let's get outta here.


         They head for the door.


    555  THE MESA TOP OF THE MCP                                      555

         The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
         them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
         The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
         path.

    556  EXT. POD DOOR - LIEUTENANT                                   556


         on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a
         speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
         over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
         arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.

    557  CLOSER SHOT                                                  557

         It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant.

    558  THE MCP                                                      558

         from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside,
         up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP.

    559  SIDE SHOT OF THE ENTRANCE                                    559

         to the MCP. As the guardian programs enter. Sark stands waiting,
         watching them, his back to the camera.

    560  POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS                                   560


         As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
         beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
         finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
         network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
         surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
         the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
         impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
         but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
         inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
         continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
         STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
         the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.


                               MCP
                      (echoing, booming)
                    I am delighted that so many of you
                    could turn out to give your
                    power over to me...


    561  FULL SHOT - THE PROGRAMS                                     561


         lining the wall. They are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see
         them starting to de-rez.


                               MCP
                    You're very lucky, all of you. You
                    are participating in the creation of
                    the single most powerful program in
                    the history of the system... of all
                    systems...


         The programs begin to disappear, one by one.


                               MCP
                          (continuing)
                    A program with a will... with
                    ambition... a superior form of
                    life...

                               SARK
                    Go!


         Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner
         chamber.


    563  CLOSE - DUMONT'S FACE                                        563

         face.


                               MCP
                    Welcome!


    565  EXT. CARRIER BRIDGE                                          565


         Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards
         in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
         the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
         the window.


                               FLYNN
                    Check out the controls.


         As Yori looks over the control conso1e.


                               FLYNN
                            (continuing)
                    We're getting closer.

         Down the length of the carrier. It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone
         already. We see the CPU approaching, as the carrier rises.


    567  EXT. LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT                                   567


         The carrier drifts over the edge of the mesa, high above it, whole
         sections only visible as outlines.

         He is slowly disappearing.

                               MCP
                    Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
                    finally come to terms with one
                    another...

         Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to
         depart. His back is to the camera.

                               VOICE
                    SARK!


         Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..


    570  SARK'S POV                                                   570


         We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in
         one hand. It gives off a pure white light.


    571  CLOSE UP SARK'S FACE                                         571


                               SARK
                    I don't know how you survived,
                    slave.


    572  WIDE SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                      572


                               SARK
                    It doesn't matter. Prepare to
                    terminate.

         Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist.

    573  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              573


         as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
         under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
         again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
         two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
         races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.

                    I can rev this baby up a little

         He looks out sees something, does a double-take, looks again

                               YORI
                    TRON!!

    576  CLOSE UP - YORI                                              576

         tears of joy streaming down her face.

                               FLYNN
                    Let's get some power here.


         His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great
         pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.

                                                   CUT TO:

         Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and
         immediately throws his own disk.


    580  SHOT OF TWO WEAPONS                                          580

         as the two disks come at him.


                               TRON
                    I'm also better than you....


         He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as
         Sark's disk passes under him.


    582  SHOT OF SARK'S DISK                                          582

    583  SHOT OF TRON FROM BEHIND                                     583


         He looks over his shoulder, sees the disk coming at him.


    584  TRON'S HAND                                                  584


         As he slams his own disk into Sark's, using his as a shield.

                               SARK
                    Very clever, Tron. You know you
                    should have joined me.

    586  FLYNN AND YORI                                               586


         Flynn is at the controls, transferring power.


                               FLYNN
                    Any response?
                               YORI
                    It's starting


         She looks down at the battle. Her hand reaches over and grips
         Flynn's tightly.

         He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind,
         and holds up his own disk as a shield.


                               SARK
                    We would have made a great team.


    588  TRON'S DISK                                                  588


         turning sideways in its flight, edge on.

         With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through
         Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we
         see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the
         disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see
         energy pouring out of this wound like blood.

                               TRON
                    I don't think it is good for you, MCP.

                               TRON
                    Sark's out. Would you like to
                    leave a message?


                               MCP
                    I am the message. The only message.
                    Sark!


         Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
         returns to him.


                               MCP
                          (continuing)
                    SARK!


         As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over
         to him.


    599  CLOSE SHOT - WALL                                            599


         Dumont is transparent. Tron runs up to him.


                               TRON
                          (trying to pull
                       Dumont away from wall)
                    Dumont!


                               DUMONT
                    No... Tron ... must... destroy
                    MCP... first...

                               TRON
                    Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's
                    Flynn?

                               DUMONT
                             (very weak)

    600  MED. SHOT - TRON                                             600


         He turns, murder in his eyes, draws back his arm for the throw.


                               MCP
                    Program... stop. This is not allowed!


         Tron throws.


    601  SHOT OF MCP                                                  601


         The disk smashes into him. Once, twice...


                               MCP
                    I will not allow this Sark!
                           (thundering)
                    SARK!!!


         The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber. Tron continues to throw.

    602  OMITTED                                                      602

         Sark's dead hand. We see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin
         to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy. The hand moves.


    604  TRON                                                         604


         throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.


                               MCP
                           (thundering)

         His body is glowing, expanding. He starts to rise, his face looks up.

    606  CLOSE UP - FACE                                              606


         It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping
         hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises.


    607  LONG SHOT                                                    607

         Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out,
         from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the
         beam.

                    Yori, steer us over the beam,
                    right next to it.


                               YORI
                       (going to controls)
                    Why? What are you going to do?


                               FLYNN
                           (staring down)
                    Jump.


         Yori looks up.


                               YORI
                    But... won't you be de-rezzed?


                               FLYNN
                           (turns to her)
                    Probably.


    611  INT. MCP - TRON                                              611


         about to fire again. There's a sudden roar and Tron turns.


    612  TRON'S POV OF GIANT SARK                                     612


         Who rips open the doorway into the MCP and advances.


    613  BRIDGE                                                       613


         Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
         goes up to him.


                               YORI
                    Flynn... you can't... I


                               FLYNN
                          (lays finger on
                             her lips)
                    Shhhhh.


         He takes her in his arms.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                               (whispering)
                    I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
                    just once...


         His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
         change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
         love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.


    614  CLOSE UP - THEIR FACES                                       614


         Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second,
         then open.


                               FLYNN
                    Don't worry.


    615  LONGER SHOT                                                  615


         He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
         on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
         shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.


    616  HER POV                                                      616


         Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
         directly into the center of MCP itself.


    617  INT. MCP                                                     617


         Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
         his voice is that of the MCP.


                               SARK/MCP
                    End of line, program...


         We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
         static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
         Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
         Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
         and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
         and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
         cones. And connects.


    618  SHOT OF THE APEX                                             618

         A brilliant explosion of lights bursts out.

         Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
         into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.


    620  SHOT OF THE MCP                                              620


         We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
         is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
         padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
         wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
         see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
         too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
         the MCP glows brighter and brighter.


    621  YORI AND THE BIT                                             621

         on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.

    622  HER POV                                                      622

         A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
         camera.

    623  YORI                                                         623

         shielding her face from the power of the blast.

    624  LONG SHOT                                                    624


         The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
         returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
         leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.

    625  YORI                                                         625


         still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
         regaining their life.

    626  HER POV                                                      626

         one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
         brightly, increasing.

    627  LONG SHOT                                                    627

         The carrier starts to descend.

                                                   CUT TO:


    628  EXT. CPU MESA - TRON                                         628

         Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
         programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.

    629  SHOT OF CARRIER                                              629

         Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
         faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.

    630  EXT. CPU MESA                                                630

         Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
         her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
         in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.

                               TRON
                            (laughing)
                    Nice...

                               YORI
                    It's something Users do.

                               TRON
                    Where's Flynn?

         He looks up at the bridge.

                               YORI
                    He's gone. He went into the beam.
                    He saved you. He saved all of us.

         Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
         the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.

                               DUMONT
                    He really was a User...

                               BIT

    631  LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD                                      631

         of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
         shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    632  RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN                              632


         and returning to the real world.


    633  THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB                                   633


         CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
         blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.


         WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
         chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.


         Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
         shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
         back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
         himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.


         He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
         flesh and blood.


         He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
         weak sunlight coming in.


         And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
         Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
         coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.


         Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
         document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
         face.


         The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
         tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    634  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA                           634


         Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
         CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey -- you guys


         Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
         a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.


                               ALAN
                    Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
                    new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
                    and -- it's running.


                               FLYNN
                    I know, I met him.


         Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
         from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    I mean, I saw it read-up -
                    hey, look at this.


         He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
         reading it to figure out its significance.


                               ALAN
                    Your old files -- ?


                               FLYNN
                    And Dillinger's instructions to
                    divert them -- it's all there -
                    look, even his home phone number,
                    when he logged on.


                               ALAN
                    Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
                    the goods...


         Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
         get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.


                               FLYNN
                    You're telling me...


         As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
         on it.


    635  CRT SCREEN                                                   635


         The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
         are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
         typical video game:


         A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
         electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
         first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
         directions.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    you have any idea how much I can sue these
                    jokers for?


                               LORA (V.0.)
                    Well, just don't forget your old friends
                    when you're rich and famous.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
                    this joint by then...


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                   Your friend Dillinger sure won't...


         The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
         EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
         SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
         formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
         HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.


                               FLYNN (V.O.)
                    Hey, you know anybody who wants to
                    get hold of some video games... cheap?


                               LORA (V.O.)
                    You're getting out of the business?


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                    Shouldn't you wait till your
                    lawsuit's settled?


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
                    video games to last me a good long
                    time. I feel like gettin' into some
                    real life...


         at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
         yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
         HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and

                          A Screen Play

     FADE IN

     A white title appears on a black screen.

                      "One doesn't discover new lands
                      without consenting to lose sight
                      of the shore for a very long time."

                                     Andre Gide

     The title fades off, replaced by a second title.

                      "We're all in this alone."

                                     Lily Tomlin


     INT.  A WOMB.  DAY.

     A fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he
     gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of
     his mother's womb.  We focus on the unborn's hand, already a
     tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed
     lips.  He sucks his thumb.


     INT.  HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY.

     A seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached,
     smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up
     by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera.  Shocked by
     the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the
     newborn fights for his first, arduous breath.  Following almost
     immediately, a cry.

     From another angle we see the crying infant on a television
     screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible.

     MATCH DISSOLVE TO


     INT.  CAR - UTOPIA, QUEENS.  MORNING.

     The face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying.
     TRUMAN BURBANK, thinning hair, a body going soft around the
     edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the
     wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.  He
     cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears.

     Pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban
     street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and
     lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in
     front of his idling car.

     Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate.  Amidst a sea of
     shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism.

     He looks around him but the street is deserted.  He checks that
     all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though
     the fallen fixture is far larger.  He looks up into the sky but
     there is no plane in sight.  With some effort, Truman picks up
     what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of
     his car and drives away.


     INT.  CAR - TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of
     a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into
     his Styrofoam cup of coffee.  Stirring it in with his finger, he
     burns himself.

                           TRUMAN
              Shit!

     As Truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of
     children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School,
     adjacent to the parking lot.  The sound of the children triggers
     a memory in his head.


     EXT.  LONG, WIDE BEACH.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears
     to be playing on a television screen.

     A sandy-haired, SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, runs towards a bluff on
     the beach.

     The boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand,
     flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.  Suddenly, the
     father remembers his son.  He looks anxiously around.  The sight
     of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his
     bottle in the sand and run to him.

     The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father
     comes within earshot.

                           FATHER
                      (out of breath, clutching his side)
              Truman!  Truman!  Stop!

     Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his
     father.  But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the
     anger and distress on his father's face.

                           FATHER
              Come down now!

     His father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more
     tantalizing.  The boy considers defying his father.  He puts
     his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at
     the other side.  One good stretch would do it.

                           FATHER
                      (reading Truman's mind, enraged)
              No!

                           TRUMAN
                      (sensing his father is keeping
                      something from him)
              Why?  What's there?

                           FATHER
                      (unconvincing)
              Nothing's there.  It's the same as this.
                      (trace of desperation)
              Come down, please!

     Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other BEACHGOERS
     have stopped their activities to stare at him.  Reluctantly
     he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks.  When he finally
     jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and
     drags him away down the beach.

                           FATHER
              I told you to stay close.  Don't ever leave
              my sight again.  You gotta know your
              limitations.  You could've been washed
              away by the tide.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks
     briskly down the bustling street.  A snarl of taxis, buses and
     COMMUTER traffic.  A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under
     Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye.

     Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of
     Cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy
     pages.  Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and
     finding him busy with another customer, Truman deftly tears a
     portion of the open page and pockets the cutting.

     He guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the
     Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him.

                           TRUMAN
                      (quickly recovering)
              Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald".

                           VENDOR
              We ran out.

                           TRUMAN
                      (hastily departing)
              Thanks anyway.

     As Truman hurries away, the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo
     and instantly turns to the torn page.  It is a Lancome
     advertisement with ISABELLA ROSSELLINI's nose missing.
     Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to
     confront him, almost as if he were expecting it.

     Passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow
     out of the pavement, Truman glimpses himself in the reflective
     glass.  He doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his
     gut, but quickly concedes defeat.  The image triggers another
     childhood memory.


     INT.  SCHOOLROOM.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television
     screen.

     The sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of
     a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or-
     so other well-scrubbed, uniformed YOUNGSTERS.  DOUGLAS, the boy
     next to Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty-
     year-old NUN with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched.

                           DOUGLAS
              I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.

                           SISTER
                      (impressed)
              Tell the class what a chiropractor does,
              Douglas.

                           DOUGLAS
              He helps people by fixing their backs,
              Sister Olivia.

                           SISTER
              That's right, Douglas.
                      (holding her back, hamming it up)
              Perhaps I'll be your first patient.

     The CLASS titters.  Douglas sits down, pleased with himself,
     throwing a smirk to Truman.

                           SISTER
              What about you, Truman?

     Truman rises to his feet.

                           TRUMAN
              I want to be an explorer
                      (with reverence)
              ...like Magellan.

     The Sister's face falls.

                           SISTER
              No one's going to pay you to do that,
              Truman.
                      (with scarcely disguised glee)
              Besides, you're too late.  There's
              nothing left to explore.

     The class roars with laughter and Truman takes his seat.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.

     From TRUMAN'S POV we see that he is staring up at relief
     letters that proclaim, "American Life & Accident Insurance,
     Inc." above an office building's entrance.

     A POLICE OFFICER walking his beat, wanders in Truman's
     direction.  From another angle, we observe Truman from the
     Police Officer's POV - shaky, handheld camera - on a television
     screen.  Truman enters the building.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY - TWELFTH FLOOR.  DAY.

     In a cramped, cluttered, windowless cubicle, TRUMAN talks on
     the telephone.

                           TRUMAN
                      (into receiver)
              ...okay, okay, let's call it what it is...
              I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance
              is death insurance...you just gotta ask
              yourself two questions...one, in the event
              of your death, will anyone experience
              financial loss?...and two, do you care?

     A CLERK drops a large reference book on Truman's desk.  He
     checks the spine - "MORTALITY STATISTICS, 1986 to Present".

                           TRUMAN
                      (into receiver)
              Hold on will ya?
                      (to Clerk, putting receiver
                      to chest, referring to the book)
              This's no good.  Lumps all drownings
              together.  I need drownings broken down
              by category.

     The Clerk shrugs, returns the book to his trolley and continues
     his rounds.

                           TRUMAN
                      (returning to his call)
              ...just think about what I've been
              saying and lemme...hello?...

     The person on the other end has hung up.  With an apathetic
     shrug, Truman replaces the receiver.  He looks over his shoulder
     and places another call.

                           TRUMAN
                      (lowering his voice)
              Can you connect me with directory
              inquiries in Sydney, Australia?
                      (a long delay makes Truman
                      even more uncomfortable)
              ...er, yes.  Do you have a listing
              for a Lauren Powers...
                      (pause)
              ...nothing listed?...what about a Sylvia
              Powers...nothing?  Thanks...

     Truman replaces the receiver, disappointed.


     INT.  LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.  LUNCHTIME.

     TRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR
     WORKERS.  As he reaches the counter, the store owner, TYRONE,
     has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a
     meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll.  Truman gazes
     at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own
     predictability.

                           TYRONE
                      (nauseatngly cheerful)
              How's it goin', Truman?

                           TRUMAN
                      (deadpan)
              Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

                           TYRONE
                      (not listening to Truman's
                      reply, as Truman anticipated)
              Good.  Good.

                           TRUMAN
              Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?

                           TYRONE
                      (not missing a beat)
              I'd ask for identification.

     Truman forces a half-smile.

     We focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash
     register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye.  About
     to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke
     from the FEMALE CASHIER.

                           FEMALE CASHIER
                      (a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing)
              He's right there.  You're supposed to pay
              when he's here.

                           MALE CUSTOMER
                      (nonchalant shrug as he departs)
              He never notices.

     We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped
     sandwich from Tyrone.

                           TYRONE
              Hold on, Truman.  I got somethin' to show ya.

     Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that
     features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus'
     Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline.  Truman's
     eyes widen at the photograph.

                           TYRONE
                      (referring to the photo)
              The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese
              navigator, huh?  I know you love this like me.

                           TRUMAN
                      (averting his eyes with difficulty)
              Not me.  You got the wrong man.

     Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays
     the Cashier and exits.

                           TYRONE
              See ya tomorrow, Truman.


     EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.

     TRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park.
     From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, "To The
     Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration".

     A TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout.
     Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders
     and gives him it all, his appetite gone.  As the transient
     wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book.


     INT.  A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     Close up on an old man's face.  CHRISTOF.  Hair pure white,
     late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years.

     He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room.
     Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep
     blue Californian sky.  A news anchor-style earpiece disappears
     down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears.

     Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television
     monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed
     in his book, silently plays.

     CHLOE, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited,
     joins Christof at the window.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (never taking his eyes
                      from the monitor)
              You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the
              road?  They're pulling out a body.  You know
              you shouldn't look, but you do.


     INT.  A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around
     a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting
     room.  All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of
     the table, anticipating a call.  On cue, the phone rings and one
     of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up.

                           MAN
              Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough
              insurance.

     He hangs up.  After a moment the phone rings again.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call.

                           TRUMAN
                      (into receiver)
              ...this isn't about insurance, this is
              about the great variable - when will
              death occur?  Could be a week, a month,
              a year.  Could happen today...A sunbather,
              minding his own business, gets stabbed in
              the heart by the tip of a runaway beach
              umbrella...No way you can guard against
              that kinda thing, no way at all...

     The prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs
     up.  Truman's supervisor, LAWRENCE, younger than Truman by
     several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the
     corner of the cubicle.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (handing Truman some documentation)
              Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in
              Stapleton I need you to cloes by four.

     Truman turns pale.

                           TRUMAN
              Stapleton on Staten Island?

                           LAWRENCE
                      (sarcastic)
              You know another one?

                           TRUMAN
              I can't do it.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (insistent)
              A half hour across the bay.  Sea air.  Do
              you good.

                           TRUMAN
              No, I...
                      (searching for a plausible excuse)
              ...I got an appointment uptown.

                           LAWRENCE
              This is a sure thing.
                      (conspiratorial)
              They're upping our quota.  You need this.

     Lawrence exits the cubicle.  Truman's head drops.  He picks up
     the framed picture of his wife from his desk.  MERYL, early
     thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail.  He deposits
     the photo in his briefcase and departs.


     INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.

     TRUMAN, briefcase in hand, ashen-faced, stands in line for the
     Staten Island ferry.

     As the TOURISTS and COMMUTERS impatiently brush past him onto
     the boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the
     scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering
     a flashback in his head.


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     The flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the
     SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits alongside his father, KIRK, in a
     small sailing dinghy.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting above the wind)
              Let's go further, daddy!  Let's go further!

                           FATHER
                      (shouting back)
              It's getting late, Truman.

                           TRUMAN
                      (entreating his father)
              Please!...

     Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading
     towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon.


     INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.

     TRUMAN turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide
     of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street
     into the bright sunlight, gasping for air.

     Gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street
     subway station.  Two COMMUTERS surrepticiously observe Truman as
     he departs.

                           COMMUTER 1
                      (commenting out of Truman's earshot)
              I can't believe he's taking the long way.

                           COMMUTER 2
              He'll never make it.


     INT.  SUBWAY TRAIN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN stands in a packed subway car, anxiously glancing at his
     watch, wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief.


     INT. TAXI.  DAY.

     A taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten
     Island.  TRUMAN keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across.
     refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor.


     EXT.  BAY STREET, STATEN ISLAND.  DAY.

     TRUMAN finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do
     condominium on Bay Street.  As he approaches the lobby, he
     realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his
     suit jacket.


     INT.  CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     A middle-aged CONCIERGE behind a reception desk, is having his
     hair brushed by a YOUNGER MAN in his mid-thirties.  Anticipating
     Truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and
     swiftly departs through a rear door.  TRUMAN enters the lobby
     and approaches the CONCIERGE, trying to keep his arms tightly at
     his sides to hide the perspiration.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.

                           CONCIERGE
              You from the insurance company?  You missed him.

                           TRUMAN
              When will he be back?

                           CONCIERGE
              Vacation.  Two months.  He waited as long as
              he could.  You was supposed to be here by four.

     A clock on the wall reads 4.l2pm.


     INT.  SUBWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     TRUMAN sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated.
     The only other occupants in the train, a TALL WOMAN, mid-
     thirties, reading a pulp novel and two MALE YOUTHS, late-teens,
     sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her.

                           YOUTH 1
                      (to woman)
              You wanna read to me?

     His companion smirks.

                           YOUTH 1
                      (more insistent)
              You wannna read to me?

     The woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now.
     She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book.  The
     other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp.

                           YOUTH 2
                      (menacing)
              My friend asked you a question.

     The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and
     holds it to her.  She looks around the train for assistance,
     briefly catching Truman's eye.  The youths also look in
     Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere.
     Truman quickly averts his gaze.

                           WOMAN
                      (reaching for the book)
              Please...

     The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips
     out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt
     pocket.

                           YOUTH 2
              Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.

     The train pulls into a deserted station.  Feeling vulnerable,
     the woman jumps up from her seat and exits.  The youths, sensing
     a chase, also exit.  Scanning the empty platform, the woman
     realizes she has made a serious error.  Truman watches through
     the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman
     but still he remains in his seat.

                           YOUTH 1
              We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.

     One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it
     in the woman's face.

                           YOUTH 2
              Don't you wanna know how it ends?

     The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of
     their bodies.  The woman looks again in Truman's direction.
     Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading.

                           WOMAN
                      (screams)
              Help!!  Please, help!!

     The woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes.
     Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door.  There
     is still time to act.  He stands up and half-reaches for the
     handle but moves no further.

     The train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of
     the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches
     under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel.  Truman bows
     his head in shame as the train rattles on.


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  DAY.

     The train safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release the
     WOMAN.  She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid.
     The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve
     her shoulder bag.

                           WOMAN
              Thanks.

     The threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong
     friends.

                           WOMAN
                      (pondering the incident)
              He did nothing.

                           YOUTH 1
                      (shrugs, suddenly more couth)
              Physical violence paralyzes him.  Always
              has.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DUSK.

     The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home.  Beyond
     the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy
     Expressway.

     TRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, MERYL,
     pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry.  She has a
     sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new
     knife-set in a wooden block.  She kisses Truman affectionately
     on the cheek.

                           MERYL
                      (proudly referring to the knife-set)
              I got it free with the tune-up.

     Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch
     of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes.

                           MERYL
              You missed a section.

     Meryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and
     obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As
     the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass,
     Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for
     Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY.

     MERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to her hands)
              Do they hurt?

                           MERYL
              I was afraid I'd seize up during cross.
              One of the keys kept sticking.

     Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.  He
     notes an article headlined, "SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK".

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to the article)
              Is he gonna take the stand?

                           MERYL
                      (dispassionate, matter-of-fact)
              No point.  Two eye witnesses saw him
              near the dumpster where they found the legs.

     She flexes her arthritic wrists.

                           MERYL
              You gonna eat before you leave?

                           TRUMAN
              I'll get something out.

                           MERYL
                      (sensing something odd
                      in his demeanor)
              Did something happen today?

     Truman turns to her too sharply, his guilt showing.

                           TRUMAN
                      (composing himself)
              What could happen?


     EXT.  UNOPENED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.

     An abandoned freeway project in Queens.  The four hundred yard
     stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked.  At one end
     is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air, reinforcing steel
     protuding from the concrete.

     TRUMAN stands at the end of the off-ramp with MARLON, thirty-
     two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big.
     Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up
     golf ball with a number three wood.

     Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the
     ball.  The ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the
     adjacent operating roadway.  From a new angle we see the ball
     take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and
     continue down the asphalt.

     Marlon tosses Truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred
     golf balls - a ball initialed with the letter, "T".  Truman sets
     the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into
     his second shot.  With a slight fade, the second ball carries
     even further than the first.

     Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment.
     Marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot.

                           MARLON
              Ouch.  Whose nuts were those?

                           TRUMAN
                      (opening a beer from the six pack)
              Mine.

     Marlon tees up a ball of his own. initialed with the letter "M".

                           TRUMAN
              I gotta get out, Marlon.

                           MARLON
                      (mild interest only)
              Yeah?  Outta what?

                           TRUMAN
              Outta my job, outta Queens...out!

     Marlon takes a practise swing.

                           MARLON
              Outta your job?  What the hell's wrong
              with your job?  You gotta great job.
              You gotta desk job.  I'd kill for a desk
              job.

     Marlon addresses the ball and swings.  A sweeping hook shot
     that bounces off the freeway out of bounds.

                           MARLON
                      (annoyed by the errant tee shot)
              Sonofabitch.

                           TRUMAN
              It doesn't mean anything.

                           MARLON
                      (still looking in the
                      direction of his ball)
              Nothing means anything.  Try stocking vending
              machines for a living.  My biggest decision
              of the day is whether the Almond Joys look
              better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.

     Truman selects another "M" ball from the bucket and tosses it to
     Marlon.

                           TRUMAN
                      (adamant)
              I gotta get out.

     Overcompensating with his second shot, Marlon slices the ball in
     the other direction.  A lucky bounce keeps it on the cement
     fairway.

                           MARLON
                      (skeptical, picking up his beer)
              Sure and go where?

     Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer.

                           TRUMAN
                      (unable to disguise his reverence)
              Australia.

                           MARLON
                      (impressed)
              No shit.  Where is Australia exactly?
              Near England?

     Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate.  He points to a
     dimple on his make-shift globe.

                           TRUMAN
              See here, this is Queens.
                      (sliding his finger around
                      the other side of the ball)
              All the way round here, Australia.  You
              can't get any further away before you start
              coming back.
                      (tossing the world in his hand,
                      warming to his subject)
              Y'know, there're still places in Australia
              where no human being has ever set foot.

                           MARLON
                      (still dubious)
              So when are you leaving?

                           TRUMAN
              It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.
              You can't just up and go.
                      (heading off Marlon's skepticism)
              Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about
              that.  I just gotta move slow.  Pick a
              moment.  Bonus time's just around the
              corner.  Soon as I get a retaining wall
              built on the back of the house I can
              start thinking about selling up...and I'll be
              gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.
                      (as if to convince himself)
              I'm going, don't you worry about that.

     Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond
     his imagination.

                           MARLON
              I never knew anybody who got out.

     An awkward moment.  Truman, once again, not so sure of himself.
     He masks his doubt by teeing up another ball.

     DISSOLVE TO


     EXT.  FREEWAY.  LATER THAT NIGHT.

     TRUMAN and MARLON wander down the empty freeway, retrieving
     the golf balls.  As they return them to the bucket they check
     the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their
     long-drive competition.

                           TRUMAN
                      (slightly the worse for drink)
              Tick-fucking-tock.  That's the fucking
              problem, Marlon.  I'm thirty-four.  I'm
              older than Jesus Christ.

     Marlon looks sideways at Truman.  It sounds to him like the beer
     talking.

                           TRUMAN
              Where do the dreams go, Marlon?

                           MARLON
                      (picking up the last ball marked with an
                      initial "T", trying to ignore the question)
              You win.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm serious.  Where do the dreams go?

                           MARLON
                      (humoring his maudlin friend)
              They're still there.  Just buried under what
              we settled for.

     They approach Truman's Oldsmobile.  Truman opens the trunk to
     deposit their humble golfing equipment.  Inside are the remains
     of the fallen light fixture.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to the light)
              You really think it could've dropped off an
              airliner?

                           MARLON
                      (unimpressed)
              Sure.  It's halogen.  You oughta report it.
                      (quickly changing the subject)
              You coming for a drink?

                           TRUMAN
              I can't tonight.


     EXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     The lines of a television screen signal another of Truman's
     flashbacks.  A small group of MOURNERS in black, several openly
     weeping, stand on the end of a small jetty, including the SEVEN-
     YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit, his weeping
     MOTHER, older sister, RAQUEL, and a PRIEST at the head of the
     gathering.

     The priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath, heavy and
     cumbersome in his tiny hands.  He heaves it off the dock.

     MATCH DISSOLVE TO


     EXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT, LONG ISLAND.  NIGHT, PRESENT.

     A smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water
     beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later.  TRUMAN stares at the
     wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the
     shoreline.

     In his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand.
     He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and
     points a corded microphone at the surf.  For a long while we
     watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the
     lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible
     through the gloom.

     We focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse.  From the
     light's POV, through the green hue of a night vision camera, we
     observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting at the surf)
              I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!


     INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF's dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a
     television monitor that displays the distraught TRUMAN at the
     water's edge.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     At the Formica kitchen table, TRUMAN makes calculations in a
     school notebook, a bottle of beer close at hand.  MERYL appears
     in her robe, a glimpse of black negligee beneath, restless.  She
     throws her arms around Truman's neck.

                           MERYL
                      (suggestive)
              What are you doing?  Come to bed.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring the suggestion)
              I figure we could scrape together eight
              thousand.

                           MERYL
                      (suddenly exasperated)
              Oh.  God, everytime you and Marlon--

                           TRUMAN
              --We could bum around the world for a year
              on that.

                           MERYL
              And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to
              where we were five years ago.  You're talking
              like a teenager.

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe I feel like a teenager.

     Getting to his feet.  Truman holds Meryl by the arms, talking
     excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were
     courting.

                           TRUMAN
              Meryl, it'd be an adventure.

                           MERYL
              We said we'd try for a baby.  Isn't that
              enough of an adventure?

                           TRUMAN
              That can wait.  I want to get away.  See
              some of the world.  Explore.

     Meryl gives a derisive laugh.

                           MERYL
              You want to be an explorer?  You mean like
              all the other great explorers from Queens?
              You don't even have a passport, Truman.  I
              bet you don't even know how to get one.

     The words sting.  Truman turns away.

     Seeing the pain she's caused, she changes tack.

                           MERYL
              This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this
              now and then.
                      (making one more attempt
                      at seduction)
              Come to bed.


     EXT.  A NIGHTWATCHMAN'S OFFICE SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     In a nightwatchman's office, two UNIFORMED GUARDS drink coffee.

                           GUARD 1
              How can they have a child?

                           GUARD 2
              It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

                           GUARD 1
              Why not?

                           GUARD 2
              You think she'd go through with it?
                      (reassessing his own opinion)
              Guess I always thought they'd adopt.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     TRUMAN stands in the darkened bedroom in his Hanes underwear
     looking down at his bed.  MERYL has fallen asleep waiting for
     him, snoring lightly.  Truman rests his hand tentatively on the
     bed.  The surface rocks.  A waterbed.  The motion triggers a
     flashback in his head.


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAWN, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen.
     The SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits on the upturned hull of a small
     dinghy in calm, deep water.

                           TRUMAN
                      (plaintively calling into the mist)
              Daddy!!...Daddy!!...

     His cries go unanswered.


     INT.  A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     Two OLD WOMEN, seventies, sit beside wach other on a sofa
     against a bare wall, looking directly into camera as they
     talk.  Nothing else of the room is seen.

                           OLD WOMAN 1
                      (playing amateur psychiatrist)
              It left him with more than his obvious fear
              of the water.  It's as if he felt his father
              had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed
              never to repeat the mistake.  He was never
              the same curious little boy again.

                           OLD WOMAN 2
              We're all born with a pound of cocaine
              up our nose.  By the time we're eleven
              it runs out.

                           OLD WOMAN 1
              Half the people I knew named their
              babies after him.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the
     newspaper stand. He picks up a copy of Vogue and flips through
     the glossy cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing CLAUDIA
     SCHIFFER's nose from one of the pages.  He returns the magazine
     to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the
     rush hour pedestrian traffic.

     Pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building, he
     glimpses the reflection of a HOMELESS MAN standing directly
     behind him.  Truman, spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels
     around to face him.  The Homeless Han is in his late-sixties.
     more well-groomed and well-fed than the average vagrant, with a
     serene smile on his face.

     From a new angle we see a two-shot of Truman and the Man on a
     television screen.  The Homeless Man places his hand ever so
     gently on Truman's cheek.  Truman makes no effort to withdraw.
     He is transfixed by the the man's eyes.  He appears to recognize
     him.

                           TRUMAN
                      (almost to himself, mouthing
                      the word)
              Daddy...

     Suddenly a distinguished OLD WOMAN walking a small dog and a
     YOUNG MALE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase, walking in
     opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the Homeless Man,
     one taking each arm.

     A bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group,
     doors already open, and before Truman can react, the Old Woman
     and the Young Executive force the Homeless Man onto the bus.
     Truman lurches after them, but he is met by the bus doors,
     closing sharply in his face.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to BUS DRIVER)
              Hey, stop!  Stop!!

     Truman thumps against the doors, but the BUS DRIVER ignores his
     cries and the bus roars away from the curb.  He starts to run
     after the bus, colliding with several PEDESTRIANS who make no
     attempt to avoid him.

     Stepping blindly into the street, he tries to hail a taxi.
     A vacant cab suddenly switches off its "FOR HIRE" light as he
     reaches it.  Truman pleads with the TAXI DRIVER through the
     closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is
     apparently oblivious to Truman's shouts.

     Frantic, Truman, dashes into a nearby parking structure and
     grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised
     parking attendant's kiosk.  Running along the rows of parked
     cars, Truman desperately presses the car security buttons
     attached to the key rings

     A car alarm chirps and Truman turns in time to see the car's
     winking sidelights.  He jumps inside a brand new BMW and guns
     the car.  The PARKING ATTENDANT, alerted by the squealing tires,
     appears from the Men's Room and attempts to wave Truman down.

                           ATTENDANT
                      (running after the car)
              Hey!

     Truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street
     without looking, causing a taxi and a postal van to take
     evasive action.

     Catching sight of the bus in the distance, Truman leans on the
     car's horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists.  He is
     only a couple of car-lengths from the bus.

                           TRUMAN
                      (reading aloud, the
                      ID number of the bus)
              Two, four, oh, six.

     Suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to
     slow for no apparent reason.  Truman looks for a way around
     but the cars crab across the street, blocking any passage,
     working together almost as if they are running interference.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting at the cars)
              Outta the way!  Outta the way!

     The bus is escaping.

     Truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car, scattering
     PEDESTRIANS.

     The same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his
     progress suddenly accelerate in unison, anticipating his move.
     By the time Truman reaches the end of the sidewalk, the cars are
     clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam.  Truman
     spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and
     disappear from view.

     Fumbling with the gear stick. he finally finds reverse but turns
     to find a hostile group of PEDESTRIANS herded tightly together
     behind the car, leaving Truman with nowhere left to go.

     The car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath
     PARKING ATTENDANT yanks Truman from the driver's seat.

                           ATTENDANT
              What the fuck are you trying to pull?!

                           TRUMAN
                      (cowering, the fight instantly
                      gone out of him)
              I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  No harm done!
              No harm done!

                           ATTENDANT
                      (feverishly inspecting the
                      fenders for dents, he finds none)
              I oughta fuck you up!

     The Attendant looks into Truman's terrified eyes.  They get
     the better of him.

                           ATTENDANT
              Get the fuck outta here.

     The Attendant shoves Truman's briefcase into his arms and
     brushes him aside.  As he departs, Truman notices that the
     traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of
     pedestrians has dissolved.


     EXT.  BUS DEPOT.  DAY.

     Row after row of parked buses.  TRUMAN and MARLON exit an
     administration office.  Instead of heading for the exit, Truman
     begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the
     number painted on the rear of each one.

                           MARLON
              What're you doing?
                      (gesturing to the office)
              The man told you there's no such bus.

                           TRUMAN
              He's lying.  Two, four, oh, six was
              definitely the number.

     Marlon stops walking.  Truman continues his inspection.  Seeing
     there is no reasoning with him, Marlon hurries to catch him up.

                           TRUMAN
              I never believed he was dead.

                           MARLON
                      (trying to be patient)
              C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find
              a body.  You know what the currents are like
              in that water.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shudders, a memory
                      flashing in his head)
              You had to see his face when that wave hit.
              He wasn't scared Marion.  It was like he
              was expecting it, waiting for it.  He
              knew it was coming.

                           MARLON
              Why would he fake it?
                      (trying to make light)
              He's not Elvis Presley.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring the joke, pondering
                      the morning's events)
              You know what was really strange about today?
              An old woman with a little dog and a
              businessman, walking in opposite directions
              on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork.
              They force him onto a bus against his will,
              a bus that doesn't normally stop outside
              my building.  And when I'm giving chase, the
              bus never makes another stop and I get the
              feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians
              are working together to make sure I never
              catch up with it.

                           MARLON
                      (sarcastic)
              Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and
              the buses and the cars?  What are you
              saying, the entire population of Lower
              Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding
              out that your father staged his death to
              pursue a life as a street person?  Oh yeah,
              that makes sense.

     Truman has no answer.  We see an aerial shot of Truman and
     Marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of
     buses, Marlon still marveling at Truman's obstinance.  They
     have come to the last bus in the final row.  Truman hangs his
     head.  The offending bus is not amongst them.  He makes towards
     the exit without comment and Marlon follows.

     Unseen by the pair, we focus on the ID number on one of the
     buses they have previously checked - "2400".  A single drip of
     black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

     TRUMAN and MARLON, drinking beer, sit in the rear doorway of
     Marion's delivery van, wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked
     behind them.

                           TRUMAN
              You think I imagined it, don't you?

                           MARLON
              I think you're missing your dad.
                      (trying to be delicate)
              The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?

     Truman is surprised Marlon remembered.  Marlon nods to the
     sidewalk.

                           MARLON
              You got sand in your cuffs.

     Truman looks down at his feet.  A small, tell-tale pile of sand
     has poured out of his tight trouser cuff.

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe you're right.  If only the old
              woman hadn't left her dog behind.

     We see a flashback in Truman's head of the earlier scene in the
     Lower Manhattan street.  It confirms that the old woman's DOG
     was abandoned on the sidewalk.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT, QUEENS.  DAY.

     TRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy.
     doilyed apartment with his older sister, RAQUEL, late forties,
     prematurely grey.  Through a doorway, the figure of his MOTHER
     is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour.  Truman and
     Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her.

                           RAQUEL
              Don't you dare go in. Truman.  I just
              got her off to sleep.

                           TRUMAN
              It was Dad. I swear.

     Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare.

                           RAQUEL
              Well, the next time he shows up. bring
              him over.  Until then, I'm not saying a
              word about this to Mom and neither are you.

                           TRUMAN
              If it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Can you
              think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?

                           RACQUEL
              I know a reason he'd want to hide from you.
              Look at how you treat us.  You live ten minutes
              away, we hardly see you from year to year and
              then you turn up with this story so insane you
              don't even believe it yourself.  Haven't you
              hurt her enough, Truman?  She already blames you.

                           TRUMAN
                      (incredulous)
              I was seven years old!

                           RAQUEL
              But you're here and he's not.  Has it really taken you
              this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm telling you he's alive!

                           RAQUEL
                      (snapping back bitterly)
              And I'm telling you he's fish food!

     Truman meets her unforgiving eyes.  Without another word, he
     walks out of the apartment.

     Truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out.
     CHRISTOF, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close
     to Truman without being detected.  Raquel's demeanor immediately
     changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears
     younger, posture more upright, almost a different person.
     Christof hugs Raquel.

                           CHRISTOF
              You did well.


     INT.  DRESSING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     A cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical
     mirrored make-up tables.  At the only occupied table, Truman's
     contrite father, KIRK, is having what's left of his homeless
     disguise cleaned from his face by a MAKE-UP ARTIST under the
     watchful eye of two DARK-SUITED BODYGUARDS.

     From a mezzanine floor out of Kirk's vision, CHRISTOF and CHLOE
     also take in the proceedings.  Behind their heads, a monitor
     shows a surveillance picture of an agitated TRUMAN sitting in
     his car, trapped in rush-hour traffic.

                           CHLOE
              We've tightened security.

     Christof nods indifferently, knowing the damage is already done.

                           CHLOE
                      (referring to Kirk)
              Why would he do this to us?

                           CHRISTOF
              Old age.  Sentiment.  You play someone's
              father all those years, you are someone's
              father...He sees the way Truman is.  He
              feels responsible.

     Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony,
     containing a state-of-the-art monitor and VCR.  Chloe follows.
     Christof plays the cued recording without comment.  We focus on
     the screen.


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     A younger-looking CHRISTOF sits in a motorboat in the calm
     water of Long Island Sound.  Truman's father, KIRK, twenty-seven
     years younger and a DARK HAIRED BOY, Truman's age at the time,
     acting as a stand-in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy.
     Two SCUBA DIVERS in the ocean.

                           YOUNG CHRISTOF
                      (barking instructions to Kirk)
              ...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...

     Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction.

                           YOUNG CHRISTOF
              The freak wave will strike from the
              starboard side.  Remember, you don't
              go to the diver.  The diver goes to you.

     To simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on
     the side of the dinghy to capsize it.  Kirk and the boy are
     tossed into the water.  While the boy immediately bobs to the
     surface in his life jacket, Kirk fails to surface.  After a long
     moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away.
     now wearing a spare aqualung.

                           YOUNG CHRISTOF
              ...Good!  Good!...of course, on the day you
              only surface once you're safely beyond the
              cove...Try it one more time...You okay?

     Kirk is staring at Truman's stand-in, clinging to the upturned
     boat.  Kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing
     participant in the masquerade.

     The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirk's uncertain
     face.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.

     A cluttered garage, dimly lit by a single work lamp.  TRUMAN
     looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty
     trunk under a canvas sheet.  The trunk is fastened with a
     combination lock.  He deftly dials the correct combination and
     opens the lid.

     Inside, mementoes from his youth.  A "HOW TO SAIL" book, a
     stack of "GREAT EXFLORERS" magazines, and beneath it all, a
     garment in a drycleaning bag.  Truman carefully lifts up the
     plastic to reveal a schoolgirl's lavender cardigan decorated
     with pearl beading.  He puts the cardigan to his nose and
     breathes deeply.

     Footsteps.  Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and
     shuts the lid.  MERYL, standing close behind.

                           MERYL
              What're you doing out here?

                           TRUMAN
                      (turning attention to an upturned
                      mower on the garage floor)
              Fixing the mower.

     Meryl doesn't look like she buys it.

                           MERYL
                      (concerned)
              Your sister called.  She was worried about you.

                           TRUMAN
                      (matter-of-fact)
              I saw my father on State Street dressed as
              a homeless man.

                           MERYL
                      (attempting to comfort)
              I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.

                           TRUMAN
                      (irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)
              What do you want?

                           MERYL
              I made macaroni.

                           TRUMAN
              I gotta go out.  About a replacement...
                      (hastily adding)
              ...mower blade.

     Meryl nods, not at all convinced.  After an uncomfortable
     pause, she turns and heads back to the house.


     EXT.  CAR WASH.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly
     washed Oldsmobile.  In the background is the warning sign he
     has just ignored, "CLOSE WINDOWS, LOWER AERIALS".

     Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender
     cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the
     severed aerial.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides
     with PEDESTRIANS.  As he drives, he tests his car radio.
     Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station.

                           FEMALE VOICE (from radio)
              ...west on Atlantic...he's making a right
              on Woodhaven...

     Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds
     that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio.
     Distracted, he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk.

                           MALE VOICE (from radio)
              ...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's
              on the move again, passing the Burger King...

     Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. Suddenly
     there is a piercing blast of feedback.  He looks up and, as far
     as the eye can see, every PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER
     along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right
     ear at exactly the same moment.

                           MALE VOICE
                      (from radio, in distress himself)
              ...something's wrong.  Change frequencies...

     Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without
     success.


     EXT.  DRUG STORE.  DUSK.

     Still shaken by his experience with the radio, TRUMAN exits
     a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag.  Out of the corner
     of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right
     ear with his finger.  He goes to say something to the by-stander
     but thinks better of it.


     EXT.  REDLIGHT DISTRICT, QUEENS.  NIGHT.

     HOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares.
     TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of
     the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each
     is by-passed.

     Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy,
     prostitute, VERONICA, wearing a platinum blonde wig.  She is in
     deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL.  Veronica recognizes
     the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window.

                           VERONICA
              Hey, Truman!  Where you bin?  You bin
              cheatin' on me?

     Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger
     seat.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     VERONICA knows the form.  As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb,
     she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the
     drycleaning bag on the back seat.  She drapes the cardigan
     around her shoulders.
                           VERONICA
              Bout time you got this thing cleaned.
                      (half-joking)
              Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady
              wear it.

     Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply.  Veronica
     removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it.

                           VERONICA
                      (examining the bottle)
              God, do they still make this stuff?
              What's the Sell-By Date?


     INT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  NIGHT.

     From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park.
     CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park
     grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe,
     the Unisphere.  Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a
     miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up
     picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car.

                           CHLOE
                      (into a flip-phone,
                      condescending)
              ...you see him messing with the antenna...what
              did you think would happen?..."lapse of
              concentration", is that what you call it?
              I call it amateur-hour...
                      (sarcastic)
              In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to
              do it over.

     Christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant
     with affection and even a mild amusement.

                           CHLOE
                      (as she hangs up, querying the
                      smile that plays around his lips)
              You think this is funny?

                           CHRISTOF
              The mask has slipped before.  Everything
              can be explained.

     TRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car
     unaware that they are being observed.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (adopting a more serious tone
                      as he returns his attention to Truman)
              What's dangerous is that he makes the connection
              between what happened today and the girl.

     We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge
     of the pool surrounding the great steel globe.

                           VERONICA
              Like I say, I don't normally do this.
              I gotta charge extra.

     Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills.
     Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as
     modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain.

     When she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her
     shoulder.  Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in
     her role.  She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the
     nape of his neck.  Slowly both heads drift together, but stop
     just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close.  So close
     they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight
     separating them.  Then finally their lips touch in the most
     gentle of caresses.

     They hold the kiss for another long moment and then
     simultaneously break.  As they look into each other's eyes,
     Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing
     a finger to his lips.  Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the
     cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste.

     From Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement,
     triggering a flashback in his head.


     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.

     As with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be
     playing on a television screen.  However, on this occasion it is
     also accompanied by CHRISTOF's comments from his perch in the
     tower above the park.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              He's re-created the event on and off for a
              number of years.  We've never understood what
              prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that
              matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy
              to approach her in the first place...

     A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, carrying a stack of books, spies
     LAUREN, sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender,
     beaded cardigan at her open locker.  She is entertaining two
     GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              We'd noticed them making eyes at each other
              for some weeks but never thought he'd say
              anything.  She was a year older, wrote poetry,
              way out of his league...

     Truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the
     lockers.  The three girls look up, surprised by the
     interruption.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting)
              Hi.

                           GIRLFRIEND 1
                      (to Lauren as the two girlfriends
                      abruptly depart)
              See you in class.

     Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends.

                           TRUMAN
              Lauren, right?

     Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her
     text books.

                           LAUREN
              No.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring her lack of interest)
              Look.  I was wonder--

                           LAUREN
              --I can't go out with you.

                           TRUMAN
              I haven't asked you yet.

                           LAUREN
              Well when you do, that's my answer.
                      (softening)
              I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.

                           TRUMAN
                      (summoning up courage from somewhere)
              Why, you married?

     Lauren smiles despite herself.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm not asking you to have my children,
              just a pizza.  How about Saturday?

                           LAUREN
                      (adamant)
              No.

                           TRUMAN
              Friday?

     Lauren looks around the deserted school corridor.

                           LAUREN
              Now.

                           TRUMAN
              Right now?  We got finals.

                           LAUREN
              If we don't go now, it won't happen.

     Truman hesitates.

                           LAUREN
                      (impatient, looking anxiously around)
              Well, what do you want to do?

     THE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT
     SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED.


     EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  DUSK.

     The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the
     Unisphere.  The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              We knew we were taking a risk.  She hadn't
              been properly coached, but we were torn...
              He'd summoned the courage to make the
              approach...We wanted to reward that.  Of
              course she took full advantage...

     Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding
     the steel sculpture.

                           LAUREN
              I never knew this place existed.

     They both stare down at the inviting water.  Lauren suddenly
     throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another
     thought.  She comes splashing to the surface.  Truman stares
     down, transfixed hy the shimmering water.

                           LAUREN
              Come on!  Come on!  It's wonderful!

                           TRUMAN
                      (nervous)
              I...I can't.

     Lauren suddenly stops splashing.

                           LAUREN
              That's right.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.

     She quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet.

                           TRUMAN
                      (confused)
              Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about.
              Has someone been talking to you?

     Lauren wrings out her dress.

                           LAUREN
                      (to the sky, upset)
              Get me out of here.  I don't want to
              be here.

     Lauren starts walking away.

                           TRUMAN
                      (confused, calling after her)
              What are you talking about?  Lauren!  Lauren!

     Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing
     her to face him.

                           LAUREN
                      (distraught)
              My name's not Lauren!  It's Sylvia!

     Truman looks into her eyes and believes her.

     THE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND
     RETURNS TO NORMAL.

     TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder
     of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as
     Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later.  As we
     have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great
     delicacy.  Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips
     with her finger.

                           SYLVIA
              In a minute someone's going to come and
              stop me talking to you.

                           TRUMAN
                      (looking around the deserted park)
              Who?  There's no one around.

                           SYLVIA
                      (covering his lips once again)
              You remember when you were a little boy,
              you stood up in class and said you wanted
              to be an explorer like Magellan.  And your
              teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too
              late, Truman.  There's nothing left to
              explore."  And all the other kids laughed.
              And you sat down.

                           TRUMAN
                      (incredulous)
              How do you know about that?

                           SYLVIA
              It doesn't matter.  You've forgotten about
              that boy, Truman.  You got scared.  Just
              because something happens, doesn't mean you
              can't take another chance in your life.

                           TRUMAN
              I don't understand.

                           SYLVIA
                      (looking over her shoulder nervously)
              There isn't much time.  Just listen.
              Everybody's pretending Truman.  Everybody
              but you.
                      (pointing to the
                      buildings on the horizon)
              Look at that project.  You think anybody
              lives there?  It's all for you, Truman.
              A show.  The eyes are everywhere.

                           TRUMAN
                      (protesting)
              Eyes?  Where?

                           SYLVIA
                      (frustrated, raving)
              Everywhere, disguised...Truman, they're
              going to fill your head with lies.
              You've got to make yourself deaf, you
              understand?  When you're afraid the most, it
              means you're on the right track.  Trust that
              boy.  Promise me you'll do that?

     Truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making.

     Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of
     nowhere.

                           SYLVIA
                      (scared)
              I told you, Truman!

     The car skids to a stop and a large MAN, 40ish, with a shock of
     dark hair jumps from the car.  The man yanks the frightened
     Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shocked)
              Hey!

                           MAN
                      (to Sylvia)
              Get in the car, Lauren!

     Truman jumps up.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the Man)
              Who are you?!

                           MAN
              I'm her father!

                           SYLVIA
              No he's not!  He's just saying that!
              Does he look anything like me?!

                           TRUMAN
              Shut your mouth!

     The man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles
     her into his car.  Truman rushes at the man.

                           TRUMAN
              Leave her alone!

     The man easily fends Truman off, knocking him to the ground.
     He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth.

                           MAN
                      (to Sylvia)
              I told you not to come here anymore!
                      (to Truman, who is getting
                      to his feet)
              Which one are you?

     Truman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back
     into his head.

                           SYLVIA
                      (calling out from the car)
              Don't listen to him, Truman.  Make yourself
              deaf.  Come find me.

                           MAN
                      (to Truman, getting into the car)
              Don't bother!  We're moving to Australia.
              New York's done something to her head.

     The Plymouth roars away.  Truman stares after it and then
     turns back to the cardigan left on the ground.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              Why did he say Australia?  Why couldn't he
              have said New Jersey?


     EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW.  DUSK, PRESENT DAY.

     VERONICA'S head suddenly appears back in frame beside TRUMAN.

                           VERONICA
              You want me to do it again?  I think I
              could do it better.

                           TRUMAN
                      (coming back to reality)
              No...thank you.

     Truman picks up the cardigan.  They return to the car.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     TRUMAN drives VERONICA back to her turf.  She smokes a
     cigarette, flicking ash out of the window.

                           TRUMAN
              Veronica, what do you know for sure?

                           VERONICA
              For sure?
                      (taking a long drag on her cigarette
                      as she gives the question due
                      consideration)
              The nuns at my school, they used to say,
              "The whole of life is faith."

     Truman regards his companion in a new light.  He comes to a stop
     at the corner where he picked her up.

                           VERONICA
                      (giving Truman an affectionate
                      peck on the cheek)
              On the house.


     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.

     Another televised flashback.  The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN
     stands reflectively beside Sylvia's open and vacated locker.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              We removed all physical trace of her
              but we couldn't erase the memory...

     ANOTHER SHORT BURST OF FAST-FORWARD AND THEN THE PICTURE RETURNS
     TO NORMAL SPEED.


     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.  DAY

     In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD
     TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's
     magazines.  By tearing out individual facial features - eyes.
     nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN
     in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to
     improvise a composite picture of Sylvia.

     The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not
     completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose.  He toys with
     several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one.
     He stares wistfully at the completed picture.

     ANOTHER BURST OF FAST-FORWARD


     INT.  SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DAY.

     SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN enters the front door.  His older
     sister, RAQUEL, has been awaiting his arrival.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              When he decided to go after Sylvia, we
              were forced to intervene once again...

                           TRUMAN
                      (excited)
              I've got something to tell you, Sis.

                           RAQUEL
                      (adopting a low, serious tone)
              I've got something to tell you too.

                           TRUMAN
                      (unable to contain his news)
              I'm going to Australia.

                           RAQUEL
              Mom's real sick.

     Truman's face falls.  As he enters the bedroom where his ill
     MOTHER lies gazing at the ceiling, we focus on his EXCHANGE
     STUDENT APPLICATION that he has inadvertently crushed in his
     hands.

     THE FLASHBACK SEQUENCE OVER, WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH
     THE IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT

     TRUMAN turns into his street but stops several houses short of
     his own driveway and kills the car's engine.  In the light of a
     streetlamp, Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed
     photograph of his wife, MERYL.  But he turns his wife's face
     away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame.

     Removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of SYLVIA
     we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by
     the years.  With the frame on his lap, Truman retrieves a
     handful of paper fragments from his jacket.  Noses.  He tests
     the likeness of each one in turn.  Unsatisfied that any of the
     new noses is an improvement, Truman tosses them out of his car
     window.  We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as
     Truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway.


     EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     Close up on a nose.  We pull back to reveal that the nose
     belongs to SYLVIA, seventeen years older than Truman's composite
     picture - slimmer in the face, wearing her hair shorter.
     She is standing at the water's edge on a long, deserted
     windswept beach, several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the
     high-water line.  In the background, a solitary, white
     beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene.

     Looking up into the sky, Sylvia's attention is drawn to a piece
     of paper carried on the ocean breeze.  The paper catches on the
     mast of one of the sailing dinghys.  A page from a newspaper,
     carrying a photograph of TRUMAN in the street where he
     encountered his father.  Sylvia retrieves the page.  The
     article's headline reads, "TRUMAN'S FATE IN DOUBT".

     Spying a MAN, late-thirties, kindly face, riding up to the beach
     house on an old bicycle, Sylvia secrets the page under her
     sweater.  The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on
     the sand.  Sylvia waves cheerfully back.


     INT.  BAR SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     In a quiet bar, a WAITRESS patiently explains her viewpoint to
     the BARMAN.  A PATRON on a barstool, eavesdrops.

                           WAITRESS
              She was willing to lose him if it meant he
              could find himself.
                      (registering the barman's blank look)
              Never mind.


     EXT.  TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee.  From inside
     the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar
     excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN.  Truman suddenly
     throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across
     the parking lot and into the school.


     INT.  UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area.
     It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the
     corridors empty.  He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open
     classroom doors as he goes.  They are all unoccupied.

     Finally, he stands outside the gymnasium.  The childrens'
     voices can still be heard.  Truman takes a deep breath and
     bursts through the double doors.

     The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder
     in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape
     of childrens' voices.  The recorder is attached to speakers on
     tall stands facing the ventilation ducts.  Truman stares at the
     machine in disbelief.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.  He stops at
     the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his
     ritual search but his heart is not in it.

     He starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection
     in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will
     appear at his side once again.  But no one joins him.

     However, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself
     that takes his interest.  An imposing forty-story office
     building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of
     reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a
     building Truman passes every day.

     As usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and
     exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating
     security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS.  Beyond security
     are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and
     delivery personnel to and from their floors of business.


     Truman abruptly enters the building.  He strides confidently
     past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs.

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
                      (to Truman)
              Can I help?

                           TRUMAN
                      (sneaking a glance at the
                      building directory)
              I have an appointment at, er...Diamond
              Enterprises.

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
              They went bust.

     The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block
     Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind
     and makes a dash for it.

     He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing,
     defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard.  A WOMAN
     EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman.  The cause
     of her concern becomes all too apparent.  Looking beyond the
     woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator
     car.

     The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building.
     Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that
     the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with
     no floors above the ground floor.

     The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other
     elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on
     folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary
     curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator
     cars.  Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn
     stares back, appalled.

     The Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take
     him by the arm.

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
              You gotta leave.

                           TRUMAN
                      (riveted by the equally-stunned
                      building occupants)
              What're they doing?

                           SECURITY GUARD 2
              You gotta leave.

     The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an
     Emergency Exit.

                           TRUMAN
                      (not going quietly)
              Just tell me what the hell's going on?

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
              We're re-modelling.

                           TRUMAN
              Like fuck!  What're they doing?


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

     TRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the
     street.

                           TRUMAN
              You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!

                           SECURITY GUARD 2
              Investigate what?  You're trespassing!

     Truman sees there is no point in arguing further.  His
     shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY.  A thought
     occurs to him.

     He starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another
     building at random.  An office block with a bank on the ground
     floor.  As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK
     STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him.  Is he so suspicious-looking or
     were they expecting him?

     Truman rushes to the elevators.  The lights above the doors
     show all the elevators on upper floors.  Frantic pressing
     of the elevator button gets no response.  Truman heads for the
     stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way.

                           OFFICIAL
              You can't--

                           TRUMAN
                      (anticipating his response)
              --I know.

     Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down
     the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district.  Every
     building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD
     anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED
     FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door.

     He feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS.  Is he simply drawing
     attention to himself by his behavior?  Truman wheels around,
     trying to make eye contact with passers-by.  They shy away.
     Truman stops still, his head reeling.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

     From the office window on the twelfth floor, TRUMAN can observe
     the glass building down the street.  He ponders the black,
     mirrored box.  LAWRENCE appears at his side.

                           TRUMAN
              You ever been into the AMT Building?

                           LAWRENCE
                      (following Truman's gaze)
              Not since they begun reconstruction.
                      (referring to the file
                      in Truman's hands)
              What're you doing with that?

                           TRUMAN
                      (defensive)
              I'm going to visit a site.

                           LAWRENCE
              What for?

                           TRUMAN
              Because I never do.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (placing a hand on Truman's arm)
              That's why we got adjusters.

                           TRUMAN
                      (looking at Lawrence's hand
                      on his arm)
              You got a problem with me going?

                           LAWRENCE
              I got a problem with you not doing your job,
              Burbank.  You already screwed up once this week.

                           TRUMAN
              Let me worry about that.

     Truman exits with the report.  After waiting only a matter of
     seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell.

     As soon as he disappears from sight, a grim CHRISTOF emerges
     from a nearby office, shadowed as always by CHLOE.   They
     approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates.

                           LAWRENCE
              680 West 89th.

     Christof nods.  Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call.


     INT.  INSURANCE CO. - STAIRWELL.  DAY.

     An out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of
     the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path
     with a large office desk they are attempting to transport.
     Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning
     clambers over the mahogany barrier.

                           MOVER 1
              Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!


     INT.  SUBWAY.  DAY.

     TRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other
     frustrated passengers.  He loses patience and suddenly
     turns and runs up the stairs.

     INT.  TAXI CAB.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no
     apparent reason.

                           TRUMAN
                      (impatiently to driver)
              Is there another way?  Can't you get around
              this?


     EXT.  A CHARRED APARTMENT BUILDING ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN exits his taxi and takes in the scene.  A partially
     burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering.  Truman
     checks the address on his file.  A small, serious-looking BOY
     straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the boy)
              When was the fire?

                           BOY
                      (shrug)
              Week ago.

                           TRUMAN
              How come it's still smoking?

                           BOY
              Started up again.
                      (dismissive)
              Kids.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to his claims report)
              Says here it burnt to the ground.

                           BOY
              Wishful thinking maybe?

     The boy is wise well beyond his years.  Truman fixes him with a
     glare.

                           TRUMAN
              Someone send you to tell me all this?

                           BOY
                      (unfazed)
              You the one askin' questions.

     The boy casually rides away.


     EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.

     TRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing.  We
     sense, truly observing for the first time.

     A group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball.  A YOUNG
     WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS.  An OLD MAN answers the
     incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD.  Nothing appears amiss.


     EXT.  TIMES SQUARE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned
     on Times Square.  Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of
     vehicles flowing through the intersection.

     Truman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out
     into the traffic.  However as his foot is poised, the stream
     of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to
     be giving him a wider berth.  He steps off the sidewalk and.
     to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth
     without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle
     will take evasive action.

     Safely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of
     the window of an electronics store.  He watches a local TV
     news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13.

     However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own
     face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the
     store window.  He shudders at his video reflection.


     INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN'S face stares out from a televison monitor.  We slowly
     pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the
     first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room
     the size of a football field.

     The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the
     ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile.
     Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from
     all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life.
     Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard,
     car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore
     to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the
     abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the
     locations strangely devoid of people.

     Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its
     illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.  Facing the
     desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs,
     wearing the slimmest of headsets.  SIMEON, a meticulous young
     man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the
     largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.

     CHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the
     live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe,
     continuing to inspect his surroundings.  CHLOE hovers in the
     background.

     There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the
     production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first
     time.  Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a
     microphone on the control panel.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...Everybody stay focused...remember who
              you are...


     EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move.

     A DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and
     carries them into a Restaurant Supply store.  Further down the
     street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an
     electrical repair in an exposed manhole.  A POSTAL WORKER does
     his rounds.  An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping
     bags.  Everybody appears natural, places to go.

     Truman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN
     at the only other occupied table at the cafe.  We see extreme
     close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of
     phoniness.  They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments
     to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys.
     Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine.

     Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he
     has been fidgeting.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     The on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the ring's POV, revealing
     that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden
     camera.  Truman suspects nothing.

     He looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime
     run, making their way down the street towards the cafe.  Truman
     happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers.  He
     springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring at the monitor)
              Damn!

     Unseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a
     moment of pleasure from the older man's distress.


     EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the jogger with
                      the familiar sneakers)
              Small world.

                           JOGGER 1
                      (attempting to sidestep Truman)
              Excuse me.

     Truman blocks the man a second time.

                           TRUMAN
              You don't remember?  Two days ago I gave you
              my meatball sandwich in the park.  You were
              in a wheelchair.  Same sneakers.

     An almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head
     confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the
     wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same.

                           TRUMAN
                      (commenting ironically on his
                      new-found mobility)
              A miracle!

                           JOGGER 2
                      (coming to his companion's aid)
              Get the hell outta here.

     The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table
     causing him to stumble.


     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - MARLON'S WORK.  DAY.

     MARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van.
     TRUMAN hurries up to him.

                           TRUMAN
              Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.

                           MARLON
                      (surprised)
              Truman!  Sorry, I'm up against it today.

                           TRUMAN
              I've fallen over something, Marlon.
              Something to do with my Dad. I think.

                           MARLON
                      (looking at him for the first time)
              Are you okay? You look like shit.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring the inquiries
                      about his health)
              It's big, Marlon.  You wouldn't believe
              who's in on it.

                           MARLON
                      (distracted)
              In on what?

                           TRUMAN
              There's no point trying to show you, they cover
              their tracks too well.  But I've been going
              into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta
              familiar faces, y'know what I mean?

                           MARLON
                      (still engrossed in his own problems)
              Something's definitely in the air.  My last
              delivery, a kid got crushed to death.
              tilting a vending machine.  They won't even
              let me take the rest of the day off.

                           TRUMAN
              Do it, anyway.

     Marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes Truman isn't
     joking.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm deadly serious. Marlon.  We can't talk
              here.  I'm being followed.

                           MARLON
                      (suddenly concerned)
              Who?

                           TRUMAN
              I don't know.  They look just like regular
              people.
                      (producing a notebook from
                      his jacket pocket)
              But I've been writing down numbers - license
              plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same
              ones keep cropping up over and over.

                           MARLON
              Is someone leanin' on you, Tru?  Cos I got
              some friends here, they owe me.  We can lean back.
                      (pointing out a taxi
                      parked outside the yard)
              Is he one of them?

                           TRUMAN
                      (anxious)
              I don't know.  Could be.  One thing's certain.
              The key is spontoneity.  Be unpredictable.
              They can't stand that.  That's why we've got
              to get outta here.  Can you come with me?

                           MARLON
                      (weakening)
              Christ, Truman.  You're gonna get both our
              asses fired.

     Marlon shuts his van and gets in.  Truman enters the
     passenger side.

                           MARLON
              Where're we going?

                           TRUMAN
              The beach.


     INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is in deep conversation with two executives.  MOSES, a
     contemporary of Christof but more jaded and debauched-looking
     and ROMAN, a fresh-faced, younger man.  CHLOE hovers in the
     background.  A monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a
     surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MARLON pulling into a beach
     parking lot in Marlon's van.

     The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control
     facility where SIMEON continues to call the shots, all too aware
     of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (marveling, excitedly referring
                      to Truman on the monitor)
              I can't believe how much he's shoved down.  That he
              sensed the significance at aged seven and clung
              to it so fiercely.

     Roman paces, agitated, unimpressed.  Moses, mnore respectful.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (gesturing to the clifftop on the
                      monitor pointedly excluding Roman
                      from the conversation)
              You remember, Moses, it used to end right
              there, before the expansion.

                           ROMAN
                      (unable to contain his anxiety
                      any longer)
              Christof, the cracks are starting to show.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (reassuring, keeping
                      himself in check)
              I'll paper over them.

                           CHLOE
                      (coming to the defense of her mentor)
              Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and
              recovered.

                           ROMAN
                      (adamant, faintly hysterical)
              No, not like this.  It's compromised.
              Becoming unwatchable.

     Too much for Christof.  He wheels on the young man.

                           CHRISTOF
              Fear?  Doubt?  Is that what you have
              trouble watching?  Perhaps you don't like
              watching yourself.

     Roman is stung into silence.

                           MOSES
                      (realizing his colleague is in
                      over his head, including Chloe
                      to save Roman's face)
              Why don't you two wait outside?

     Reluctantly Roman and Chloe exit and join Simeon at the video
     wall.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (instantly more comfortable in the
                      company of a man his own age)
              He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all.  We'll
              get him back on.

                           MOSES
              You know why they're so nervous.  The birth of
              Truman's child is going to double revenue.
              For God's sake don't let him upstage you.
                      (indicating Simeon through
                      the glass walls)
              You've been grooming a successor.

                           CHRISTOF
              He's not ready.

                           MOSES
              Him or you?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (jaw setting firm, referring
                      to Truman on the monitor)
              You can't pull him back in without me.
                      (more reflective)
              He's just acting out of character.

                           MOSES
              What if he's in character?  What if he's
              starting to act in character at last?  Have
              you ever considered that?


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND BEACH.  DAY.

     TRUMAN runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to
     scale as a seven-year-old boy.


     EXT.  CLIFFTOP.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father
     had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years
     earlier.  However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his
     father described - almost identical to its neighbor.  MARLON,
     laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop.

                           MARLON
              What're we doing here, Truman?

                           TRUMAN
              This is where it started.

                           MARLON
              Where what started?

                           TRUMAN
              Things.  Things that don't fit.  Loose threads.
              False steps.  Slips of the tongue.

                           MARLON
                      (irritated)
              Make sense, Truman.  You going religious on me?

                           TRUMAN
                      (tears of bitterness welling in his eyes)
              My father didn't want me to see what was over here.
              Whatever it was, it's gone now.  I never shoulda
              listened to him that day.  I knew it was wrong.

     We see a quick flashback of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN on the cliff-
     face twenty-seven years earlier.

                           TRUMAN
              There were a hundred people on the beach that
              day.  Everybody knew what was going on except me.

                           MARLON
              I don't want to put you down but why would
              anybody go to all this trouble over you?

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else.
                      (a memory triggered)
              A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a
              copy of Time Magazine.  The week before an ad said,
              "Next Week:  Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

     Marlon shrugs, unimpressed.

                           TRUMAN
              A guy with the same name as me in Time
              Magazine.  It ain't a common name so I
              looked out for it.  But the day it came
              out, every newstand was sold out.  No
              library had it.  I even wrote off for a
              back-issue.  Never seen a copy to this day.

     Marlon remains unconvinced.

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe I'm being set up for something.  You
              ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your
              whole life has been building to something?

     Marlon looks skeptically at Truman.  He hasn't had that feeling.

                           MARLON
                      (becoming testy)
              A coincidence.  Haven't you ever heard
              of a coincidence?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm a walking coincidence.  I can't count 'em.
              No something's happening, Marlon.  I've got
              to get to the bottom of it.

                           MARLON
                      (shaking his head in exasperation)
              Of what?!  Why're you doing this to yourself?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm scared, Marlon.  I'm as scared as hell.
              But I've never felt more alive.  It's just
              like she said.

                           MARLON
                      (suddenly intrigued)
              Who?

                           TRUMAN
              It doesn't matter.  She was too beautiful for here.

     Now Marlon is really confused.

                           TRUMAN
              Can you lend me some money?  A hundred bucks.

                           MARLON
              All I got on me is the takings from the machines.
              Why do you need it?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm going away for a while.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.

     The comfortably furnished room of a writer.  Walls lined with
     books.  Desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and
     other reference material.  Sylvia's name on the spine of several
     published volumes.  Pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten
     in blue ink.

     SYLVIA stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration.  As she
     pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor.  Truman's
     missing copy of Time Magazine.  His face on the cover with the
     headline,  "Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

     Sylvia retrieves the magazine.  In front of a nearby mirror, she
     holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment
     imagining them together.  Then, catching herself, she quickly
     lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     We see TRUMAN's disturbed face reflected in the screen of his
     television set, montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH, host of
     "Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous".  MERYL, wearing her robe,
     head against Truman's chest, sips from a bottle of beer.

                           MERYL
                      (attempting to open him up)
              What's going on, Truman?  You're not yourself.

                           TRUMAN
                      (vague)
              Maybe you just don't know me very well.


     INT.  DINING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining
     room with an elegant WOMAN, thirty years his junior.  Playing
     silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance
     shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television.

     CHLOE, enters the room and nods an apology to Christof's dinner
     companion - a woman her own age.  Christof's companion shrugs
     resignedly.  Christof registers Chloe's thinly disguised
     resentment, enjoying the rivalry.

     Chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR.  Christof
     wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as
     he gives the television his full attention.  A commercial for
     "GLOBAL TRAVEL" begins to play.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     TRUMAN continues to watch "Lifestyles" restlessly.  However, as
     he goes to get up from the sofa, MERYL starts to slide down his
     chest towards his lap.

                           MERYL
              We could do it right here, like we used to.

     The program cuts to a commercial break.  The commercial
     is for "Global Travel".

                           NARRATOR
                      (from television)
              Travelling Down Under?  Global Travel is
              turning rates to Australia upside down.  Round
              Trip to Sydney only $829.  One way, $465.
              Global Travel at Broadway and 44th...

     Truman perks up at the commercial while Meryl's attention is
     elsewhere.

                           TRUMAN
                      (abruptly getting up)
              Lemme go to the bathroom.

                           MERYL
              Don't be too long.

     Truman exits the living room.  However, on his way to the
     bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table.  He surreptitiously
     lifts the platic-coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous
     bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden.


     INT.  CHRISTOF'S BEDROOM.  DAWN.

     CHLOE pulls back long, white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular
     view overlooking the Hollywood Hills.  CHRISTOF rouses from his
     enormous round bed.  His DINNER COMPANION also stirs, waving
     coyly to Chloe as she modestly covers herself, only mildly
     perturbed by the intrusion.  Chloe switches on the television
     set in the extravagent bedroom.  Playing on the set are TRUMAN
     and MERYL still fast asleep in their own bed.

                           CHRISTOF
              What happened overnight?

                           CHLOE
              He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (smiling to himself)
              God, that thing of his must be psychic.
                      (matter-of-fact)
              He didn't masturbate?

                           CHLOE
              Not for the last two inonths.

     Chloe exits and Christof climbs out of bed.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  MORNING.

     MERYL emerges from the bathroom, ready for work, surprised to
     find TRUMAN sitting at the kitchen table.

                           MERYL
                      (rubbing ointment into her wrists)
              Aren't you gonna be late?

                           TRUMAN
              I got a call in the area.
                      (nodding to her wrists)
              What's the case?  Anything interesting?

                           MERYL
                      (dispassionate)
              Rape on the subway.

     Truman's eyes widen.  We see a quick flashback in Truman's head
     of the two YOUTHS assaulting the WOMAN on his train.

                           MERYL
              They're guilty as hell but they'll walk.  No
              witnesses.  Her word against theirs.
                      (picking up her bag to leave)
              Maybe we could meet for lunch today.

     Meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door.
     Truman waits for the sound of Meryl's car to disappear down the
     road and exits himself.


     INT.  COURT BUILDING.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN enters the courtroom building.  A crush of DEFENDENTS,
     FAMILIES, ATTORNEYS and POLICE OFFICERS.  Truman goes to enter
     a courtroom but a SECURITY GUARD blocks his path.

                           SECURITY GUARD
              You a witness?

                           TRUMAN
              Er, yes...
                      (suddenly losing heart)
              No, no I'm not.

                           SECURITY GUARD
              Closed session.

     Before the guard can move him on. Truman sneaks a look at
     proceedings through the courtroom door window.

     He recognizes the two YOUTHS sitting at the defendent's table.
     A PROSECUTOR is on his feet, addressing the JURY.  MERYL is
     working attentively at her stenotype machine, her fingers
     rapidly pressing the keys.  However, Truman notices a glaring
     omission.  There is no paper emerging from Meryl's machine.  The
     roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg.
         

     INT.  TRAVEL AGENCY.  DAY.

     The EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS inside GLOBAL TRAVEL are all doing
     a last-minute primp, fixing their hair and checking their
     clothes.  Suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and
     begin working.  As TRUMAN enters GLOBAL TRAVEL, one CUSTOMER
     looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival.

     Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a
     female TRAVEL AGENT.  Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera
     in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with
     his hand.

                           TRUMAN
              I wanna book a flight to Australia.

                           AGENT
              Where exactly?

                           TRUMAN
                      (believing she is being
                      deliberately obtuse)
              Australia.

                           AGENT
                      (a trace of condescension)
              Where in Australia?  What city?

                           TRUMAN
              Sorry, Sydney.  Sydney, Australia.  That's right.

                           AGENT
                      (entering the destination in her
                      computer)
              For how many?

                           TRUMAN
                      (finding the question suspicious)
              One.

                           AGENT
              When do you want to leave, remembering, of
              course, that you do lose a day on the way there?

                           TRUMAN
                      (more urgent than he intended)
              Today.

                           AGENT
                      (reading off her computer screen)
              I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for a
              week.

                           TRUMAN
                      (suspicious)
              A week.

                           AGENT
                      (patiently explaining)
              It's the busy season.

                           TRUMAN
                      (paranoia showing)
              You sure you're not trying to keep me here?
              You are a travel agent, aren't you?  Your
              job is to help people travel, not keep 'em
              where they are.
                      (pointing to the agent's
                      name tag, "DORIS - Travel Agent")
              Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?

                           AGENT
                      (showing amazing restraint)
              I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship
              departing for Australia tomorrow.  But you
              wouldn't want to do that.

                           TRUMAN
              Why wouldn't I?

                           AGENT
              I thought you were in a hurry.

                           TRUMAN
                      (calming down)
              That's right.

                           AGENT
              You want to book the flight?

     Truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several
     rolls of quarters from Marlon's vending machines.  The agent
     looks askance at the pile of cash.

                           TRUMAN
              You were expecting me, weren't you?

     The travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket.

                           AGENT
              It's non-refundable.


     EXT.  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF stands with a PRODUCTION MANAGER, mid-thirties, on the
     forecourt of the Sydney Opera House, its sail-like roofs soaring
     above them.  Framing the background, the coathanger-shaped
     Sydney Harbor Bridge.

                           PROD. MANAGER
                      (unable to conceal his pride)
              Happy?

     Christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring out at the pleasure
                      craft littering the harbor)
              Can we contain him long enough?

                           PROD. MANAGER
              I think so.

     Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the
     harbor.

                           PROD. MANAGER
                      (anticipating his next question)
              He flies at night.  Thick cloud cover to
              disorient him.  Hopefully we'll knock him
              out with complimentary cocktails, pull the
              shades down during the movies.  He'll never know.

     Christof gives another grudging nod of approval.  The Production
     Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are
     putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House.
     CHLOE drifts to Christof's side, a Watchman TV in her hand.

                           CHLOE
                      (referring to the surrounding scene)
              Why go to all the trouble?

     Christof glances at the TV screen in her hand, showing TRUMAN
     sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA.

                           CHRISTOF
              He believes she has the answer.

                           CHLOE
              Why not just tell him she's dead?

                           CHRISTOF
              It's too late for that.  That won't satisfy
              him.  He's going to have to find out for himself.
              See it with his own eyes.  Right now he needs
              something genuine.
                      (rueful, all too aware
                      of the contradiction)
              Even if we have to fake it.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

     Close up on typewriting appearing on a page.

              "Please accept my resignation from
              American Life & Accident, Inc. to
              take effect immediately.

              Yours tru"

     TRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a
     fellow AGENT's desk.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to agent, picking up
                      a dictionary)
              "Yours truly..."  You spell "truly"
              "l...y" or "e...l...y"?

                           INSURANCE AGENT
              I always write "Yours faithfully..."

     Truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at
     the entry for a long moment.  He looks up, staring into the
     middle distance.  His eyes widen as something clicks in his
     mind.  Suddenly LAWRENCE snatches the dictionary from his hand.

                           LAWRENCE
              Where the hell have you been, Burbank?
              What the hell's going on?

                           TRUMAN
              That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.

     The AGENTS in the other cubicles turn in their direction.

                           TRUMAN
              I was just about to resign.  Isn't that
              a laugh?  I just realized there's nothing
              to resign from, is there?

                           LAWRENCE
              Listen, don't bother with the resignation.
              Just get the fuck outta here.

                           TRUMAN
                      (addressing the whole office)
              Why're you all pretending?  Huh?
                      (gesturing to a computer terminal)
              What is this a front for?  Why aren't I in
              on the joke?  Was I away that day?!

     Noting two colleagues exchanging a look, he pulls the computer
     off the desk to get their attention.  It lands on the floor with
     an expensive crash.

                           TRUMAN
                      (hysterical)
              I'm talking to you!  Who am I?!

                           LAWRENCE
                      (taken aback by the sudden violent act)
              You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.

                           TRUMAN
                      (mimicking)
              "Security!  I'm calling Security".

     Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk, containing
     SYLVIA's hidden likeness.  Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence,
     pinning him to a cubicle wall.

                           TRUMAN
              You don't believe a single word you're saying!
                      (to the assembled group)
              None of you do!
                      (suddenly talking to a sprinkler
                      head in the ceiling)
              You hear me?!

     We see Truman's manic face from the sprinkler head's POV.
     Truman stomps off down the corridor, other Insurance Agents
     giving him a wide berth.  He shoves computers, desk lamps and
     pot holders off desks as he goes.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

     TRUMAN steps out of the office, suddenly able to breathe
     again, pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is once again standing at the picture window in the
     dimly-lit control room where we first encountered him.  Behind
     him, the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze.  The
     sky, a cloudless, cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast
     day in New York City.

     SIMEON, co-ordinating camera angles, sits in front of the
     largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of TRUMAN
     stuck in his car in gridlock.

                           SIMEON
                      (talking quietly into a
                      slim headset)
              ...and back to the close-up...

     CHLOE's attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying
     a freeze frame of TRUMAN reading the dictionary a few minutes
     earlier.

                           CHLOE
                      (to a hard-bitten Operator, staring
                      at the dictionary)
              Do you think he sees the entry?

                           OPERATOR
              Hard to tell.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (sarcastic)
              Why don't we ask him?

                           CHLOE
                      (snapping back, referring to the book)
              I don't know how it got there!
                      (to Operator)
              Enhance.

     Christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window.
     We focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionary's text.

     EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET IN QUEENS.  DAY.

     TRUMAN drives erratically down a quiet suburban street.
     On the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a YOUNG MOTHER pushing an
     INFANT in a baby carriage.

     Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front
     of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk.  He
     has the driver's door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come
     to a halt.  Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant
     from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot.

     The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds
     the crying bundle in both hands above his head.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk)
              Say my name or I'll smash its head open.

     The young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply.

                           TRUMAN
                      (vehement)
              Say my name!

                           YOUNG MOTHER
                      (composing herself,
                      reaching out for her child)
              Please, give him to me...

                           TRUMAN
                      (screaming above the baby's cries)
              Say my name!  You know my name!  Say it!

                           YOUNG MOTHER
                      (bewildered)
              I don't know you.

     The commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across
     the street, watering his garden.  He drops his hose and hurries
     towards the fracas.  Halfway across the street, the old man
     stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in
     the air.

                           TRUMAN
                      (hysterical)
              I mean it!  I'm ready to do it!
              What's my name?!!

     Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can,
     his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent
     to the concrete.  We see a view of the scene from the POV of a
     streetlight.  The young mother, recognizing Truman's
     seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes.

                           TRUMAN
                      (entreating the young
                      woman, tears in his eyes)
              This is your last chance!

     The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on
     the brink.  The young woman now has tears rolling down her
     cheeks.  She is at a loss, powerless.

                           TRUMAN
                      (his entire body shaking)
              What...is...my...name?!

     The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name.
     Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go
     through with it.  With everything he has, he gathers himself.
     After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the
     child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms.

                           YOUNG MOTHER
                      (clutching the baby to
                      her breast, without thinking)
              Thank you, Truman.

     Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the
     young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat.

     He jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the
     sidewalk and back onto the street.  The young woman and the old
     man stare after Truman's car as it roars away.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY.

     As TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous
     features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel
     insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at
     the streetlamps lining the roadway.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     A dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have
     seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon
     sun, talking animatedly.  A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the
     guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the
     television set hidden away in an antique bureau.

     SYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she
     sees playing on the screen.  The MAN on the balcony catches
     her look as she swiftly switches off the TV.  She gently takes
     the child's hand and leads him outside.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DAY.

     TRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden.
     doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to a distant
                      car on the expressway)
              See that car way down there?  I bet it's a
              Suburu station wagon.

     Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car.
     Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by.  Meryl is unimpressed.
     Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game.

                           TRUMAN
              I predict the next four cars will be a
              white Honda Civic, a blue and white
              Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing,
              a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender
              and a motorcycle.

     Meryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for
     the house.  Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch.  He
     turns to check his prediction.  A convoy of cars approaches.

                           TRUMAN
              There's the Honda...the Dodge...here
              comes the dented Beetle...

     Meryl's attention wavers.  Truman tightens his grip.

                           TRUMAN
              Look, damn you!

     Following the VW is a school bus.

                           MERYL
                      (mocking)
              Where's the motorcycle?

     Truman is momentarily disappointed.  Meryl seizes her chance
     and heads for the house.  Truman follows her inside.

                           TRUMAN
                      (yelling after her)
              Don't you want to know how I did that?
              Maybe you already know.  Is that it?

     Behind Truman's back, a motorcycle putters by.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY.

     MERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters.

                           MERYL
              Where have you been?  I've been calling you
              all day.

                           TRUMAN
              Have you been concerned, Meryl?  Nice name.
              "Meryl".  I always liked it.

                           MERYL
                      (matching his sarcasm)
              Nice of you to say so after eight years.

                           TRUMAN
              Actress's name, isn't it?  What's your
              real name?

                           MERYL
                      (rolling her eyes)
              Oh, God.  What's got into you?

                           TRUMAN
              Take a break. Meryl
                      (a knowing, almost foolish grin)
              I know.

                           MERYL
              I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.
              I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me...

                           TRUMAN
                      (irritated)
              Drop it, I said.  It's over.

                           MERYL
                      (rambling on)
              ...we need more charcoal.

                           TRUMAN
              Shut up!

                           MERYL
              I'm gonna take a shower.

                           TRUMAN
                      (catching her wrist)
              No.  We're going for a drive.

                           MERYL
              What?!

     Despite her protests, Truman drags Meryl out the back door
     and towards his car.

                           TRUMAN
                      (as he shoves her into
                      the Oldsmobile)
              For years I've been saying I want to go
              some place, well now I'm ready to go.  Let's
              just jump in the car and go.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY.

     TRUMAN holds MERYL's wrist to stop her exiting the car and
     accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking.

                           TRUMAN
                      (as they speed down the suburban street)
              I thought maybe, Atlantic City.

                           MERYL
                      (trying to mask her anxiety)
              You hate gambling.

                           TRUMAN
              That's right.  I do, don't I?

                           MERYL
              So why do you wanna go?

                           TRUMAN
              Cos I never have.  That's why you go places,
              isn't it?  Cos you're curious.  I haven't
              been curious since I was seven years old,
              y'know that?  Back then you'd have to nail me
              to the floor to keep me in one place.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     All eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track
     Truman's speeding car.

                           CHRISTOF
              How long to take Atlantic City out of
              mothballs?

                           SIMEON
              We could be up and running...three hours maybe.

                           CHRISTOF
              Give me a number five gridlock on the
              Jersey Turnpike.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New
     Jersey Turnpike.  We observe the Oldsmobile on a television
     lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead.

                           TRUMAN
                      (a manic edge to his voice)
              So much traffic, this time of day.  Does
              that strike you as peculiar?

     On the side of the road, TWO MOTORISTS, are arguing over a
     minor collision.

                           TRUMAN
                      (sneering at the sight of
                      the motorists)
              Look at them.  You believe they're
              fighting?  I don't believe it.
                      (shouting out the window
                      to the motorists)
              Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic?

     Without warning, Truman suddenly exits the freeway.  But
     his move is anticipated.  At the end of the offramp a pack of
     cars suddenly appears.  Other vehicles fill the gap behind.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to Meryl, marveling)
              Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully
              synchronized, don't you agree?

                           MERYL
                      (incredulous)
              You blaming me for the traffic?

                           TRUMAN
              Should I?

                           MERYL
              You've never been on this road before.
              You don't know what it's like.

                           TRUMAN
                      (manic)
              That's true.  We could be stuck here
              for hours.  Could be like this all the
              way to Atlantic City.

     Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk.

                           MERYL
              What the hell are you doing?

                           TRUMAN
              You're right.  Let's go back.  I'm
              sorry.  I don't know what got into me.

     Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards
     Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic.

                           MERYL
              Would you please slow down, Truman?

     Truman floors the Oldsmobile.  The car flies past the exit for
     Route 276.  He continues along the Jersey Turnpike.

                           MERYL
              Truman, that was the turnoff!

                           TRUMAN
              I've changed my mind again.  What's Maine
              like this time of year?! I've never been to
              Maine.
                      (Truman looks up through the
                      windshield at a helicopter
                      tracking his progress)
              Or let's just see where the road takes us.

                           MERYL
                      (pleading)
              Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.
              You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!

                           TRUMAN
                      (eerily calm)
              I think I'd like a little company.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Truman's
     progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically
     circled to ease identification.  Christof jabs his finger at the
     rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (to Simeon)
              What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"?
              Keep them together.

                           SIMEON
                      (agitated)
              They're rusty.  We can't keep up.
                      (rueful aside)
              We don't know where he's going any more.

                           CHLOE
              Oncoming is very thin.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

     As he speeds erratically, TRUMAN glances at the streets either
     side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of
     moving traffic.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the anxious Meryl at his side)
              Look down there, Meryl!...No cars!  I don't
              run into traffic.  The traffic follows me around.
                      (excited by his discovery)
              We're in a moving pack, don't you see?

     Truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (enthusing)
              He's so close!  It's tantilizing!

                           CHLOE
              You want to pull him over?

                           CHRISTOF
              No police.  Not yet.  We shadow him.
              We don't want him to panic.

                           CHLOE
              He's trying to outrun the traffic.

                           CHRISTOF
              He's trying to outrun the world.  Keep him
              on this route.
                      (to Simeon who is consulting
                      someone on his headset)
              Are we ready?

     Simeon nods.  Executives, MOSES and ROMAN have entered the
     control room.  They hover nervously in the background.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR, WESTCHESTER.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars
     at a police roadblock.  At the head of the line, the cars are
     being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS, who are also contending
     with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to Meryl)
              It's hard to go places, isn't it?

                           MERYL
              There's been an accident, Truman.  We
              have to go back.

                           TRUMAN
              No.  There's no accident.  It'S just more stalling.

     Truman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER.

                           TRUMAN
              What's going on?

                           OFFICER
                      (grim-faced, indicating the nearby
                      Indian Point nuclear power plant)
              Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.

                           TRUMAN
              Is there any way around?

                           OFFICER
              The whole area's being evacuated.  A precaution.

     Truman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when, all
     of a sudden, he guns his car and swerves past the barricade.


     EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.

     In the twilight sun, SYLVIA'S GUESTS wander up the gravel path,
     leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried
     in their parents' arms.  Hanging back from the rest of the
     group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back
     to the house.  As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against
     the side of the beach house, he looks in a window.

     Lit by a blue-glow, SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television
     playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our
     view.  She is unaware of the man's face at the window.

     Recognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards
     Sylvia with a resigned smile.  He mounts the bicycle and rides
     back up the path.


     EXT.  NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  DUSK.

     Truman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste
     vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant,
     the pursuing police car blocking his retreat.  TRUMAN flees the
     car, leaving MERYL in the passenger seat.

                           MERYL
              Truman!!  Come back!!

     Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in
     their protective suits carrying detection instruments.  The
     workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off
     his path to the power plant.  As he crests a slight rise beyond
     the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground.  However,
     peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the
     lights of a cityscape in the distance.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to CHLOE.

                           CHRISTOF
              Did he see it?

                           CHLOE
              I don't think so.

     The reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as
     the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling
     TRUMAN is being escorted away.  We see an aerial shot from the
     helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     MERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table.  Truman stoic,
     tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks.  Truman's airline ticket
     torn to shreds on the table in front of them.

                           MERYL
              Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're
              not well.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring her tears and medical advice)
              Why do you want to have a child with me?
              You can't stand me.

                           MERYL
              That's not true.

                           TRUMAN
                      (suddenly angry)
              Don't lie to me!

     Truman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet.  Truman follows,
     getting in her face.

                           TRUMAN
              Tell me what's happening?!

                           MERYL
                      (frightened but remaining poised)
              I thought you knew everything.  What could
              I tell you?

                           TRUMAN
                      (backing her up against
                      the kitchen bench)
              You're part of this, aren't you?!

     Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect
     herself.

                           MERYL
              Truman, you're scaring me!

     Truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness,
     grabs her wrist and disarms her.

                           TRUMAN
              No, you're scaring me, Meryl!

     Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her.
     While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to
     march her around the room, talking to the walls, light
     fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television.

                           TRUMAN
              Stop this now or I kill your leading lady.
                      (to a lamp)
              I know you can hear me.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN
     looks directly into one camera lens after another.  ROMAN is the
     first to crack.

                           ROMAN
                      (entreating Christof)
              Get somebody in there!

                           CHRISTOF
                      (quiet but firm)
              No.

                           SIMEON
                      (siding with the executive,
                      showing his true colors)
              She's in trouble!  We've got to help her!

     Christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into
     the microphone.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     We see an extreme close up of MERYL's ear.  Unheard by TRUMAN,
     from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              He's bluffing.  Call his bluff.

                           MERYL
                      (in reply to the voice in her
                      head, half-strangled due to the
                      pressure of the knife)
              Do something...

     Upon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen.  Sensing that she
     too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to
     read her face.

                           TRUMAN
                      (wild-eyed)
              Who are you talking to?!

                           MERYL
                      (incredulous)
              You're the one talking to the walls!

                           TRUMAN
              No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you
              talking to?  I swear I'll kill you, if
              you don't tell me.

     Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to
     the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman
     forces his way inside.  They both tumble onto the waterbed
     causing it to rock back and forth.  Gripping Meryl's hair,
     Truman throws aside the bed covers.

                           TRUMAN
                      (distraught, referring to the bed)
              How could you buy this damn thing when you
              know he drowned in front of me?!

     Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl
     begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash.

                           TRUMAN
              You have any idea what it's like to drown?

     Truman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping
     hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water.  She
     thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself.

     Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water.

                           MERYL
                      (gasping for air)
              Truman, stop it!
                      (to the ceiling)
              Don't let him do it!

                           TRUMAN
                      (to a light fixture, threatening)
              I'll kill her!

     He dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her
     head down longer this time.  She continues to struggle.

     Suddenly, the front door chimes.  Startled, Truman lets Meryl up
     for air.

                           TRUMAN
                      (sneering at Meryl)
              Right on time.  Cops must be telepathic.

     Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats
     her to it.  Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand.

                           TRUMAN
                      (wincing in pain)
              Damn!

     At knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the
     front door.  The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more
     insistently.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting through the closed door)
              Stay where you are or I'll kill her!

                           MARLON (O.C.)
              Truman?  It's me, Marlon.

     Truman flinches.  He was so convinced it would be the police.
     He takes a step back against the hallway wall.  Before he can
     decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door
     to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to
     Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound.

     Marlon locks eyes on Truman.  Sizing up the situation, he slowly
     but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand.  Meryl
     wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and
     collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing.

                           MERYL
                      (distraught, dropping character,
                      forgetting herself)
              They were going to let him kill me!


     EXT.  ABANDONED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.

     MARLON and TRUMAN, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end
     of their abandoned freeway off-ramp.

                           TRUMAN
              People know who I am, my every move, complete
              strangers know my name.  Even when there's
              no one around, I feel the eyes on me.

                           MARLON
                      (reluctant admission)
              I was in the bank today.  The Federal on
              Lewis.  A clerk was talking about somebody
              named Truman messing with her baby.  Is that
              the stranger you're talking about?

     Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation.

                           TRUMAN
                      (half to himself, refusing to accept it)
              No.  No.  I've never seen her before.
                      (registering Marlon's skepticism)
              I know you already think I'm going out
              of my mind but I genuinely believe the
              world revolves around me somehow.  Everybody
              seems to be in on it.

                           MARLON
              It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure
              that's not wishful thinking, you wishing
              you'd made something more of yourself?  Christ,
              Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had
              an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters?
              Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?

                           TRUMAN
              That's just it.  I think I am somebody.

                           MARLON
                      (sympathetizing)
              I used to dream all my friends and family
              got together in a hotel room, thinking of
              ways to fuck me up.

                           TRUMAN
              Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes
              I think it's for real.

     Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere
     in the night.

                           MARLON
              Tru, we've known each other since before
              we could get a hard-on.

     Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark.

                           MARLON
              The only way we ever made it through
              high school was cheating off each other's
              test papers.  Jesus, they were identical.
              I always liked that, because whatever the
              answer was, we was right together and we
              was wrong together.

     Truman nods fondly at the memory.

                           MARLON
              The only night either of us ever spent
              in jail, we spent together and I wet
              myself but you never told anyone.
              I was best man at your wedding and my
              brother was best man at my wedding and
              you didn't talk to me for a month over
              that and I didn't blame you because you've
              been more of a brother to me than he's
              ever been.  And I never shoulda let
              my Goddam father talk me into that.

     Truman is slowly coming around.  Marlon's speech from the heart
     soothing away his pain.

                           MARLON
              I know things haven't worked out for
              either of us like we used to sit up on
              Freemont Street all night and dream they
              would.  We all let opportunities pass us
              by, none of us asks for the dance as
              often as we should.  I know that feeling
              when it's like everything's slipping away
              and you don't want to believe it so you
              look for answers someplace else.  But,
              well, the point is, I would gladly step
              in front of traffic for you.

     Truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back.  We see
     a close up of Marlon's ear.  From inside, unheard by Truman,
     CHRISTOF dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF leans over a microphone at the mixing desk, feeding the
     lines to Marlon, immersed in the role.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (hushed tones)
              ...and the last thing I'd ever do is
              lie to you...

     Recognizing the importance of the moment, his colleagues stand
     around in awe at Christof's spontaneous performance, arguably
     superior to Marlon's own delivery.

                           MARLON
                      (staring into Truman's
                      eyes, repeating the
                      words in his ear)
              And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.
                      (pause)
              Think about it, Truman, if everybody's
              in on it, I'd have to be in on it too.
              I'm not in on it cos there is no it.

     Truman's head slowly drops in surrender, his doubts draining
     away.  Marlon embraces Truman in a bearhug.

     Truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star
     shines.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     From his chair, CHRISTOF modestly accepts the congratulations of
     his COLLEAGUES.  The two executives, MOSES and ROMAN are at the
     head of the line, their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten.

     CHLOE gives Christof a warm hug.

     MARLON, accepting a towel from a P.A., still in wardrobe,
     approaches and kneels beside the arm of Christof's chair.
     grasping his hand.

                           MARLON
                      (leaving his head close to
                      Christof)
              I can't thank you enough.  I don't know
              what happened.  He was so close.  It threw
              me.  I'm indebted.

     Christof gives Marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and
     Marlon withdraws.

     Finally Christof's Assistant Director, SIMEON, approaches and
     offers his hand.  Christof hesitates before shaking.  Simeon
     returns to the monitors, now showing TRUMAN alone at the dock or
     Long Island.  Christof stares out the window to conceal an
     expression of quiet vindication.


     INT.  A LTVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before sit on their sofa
     gazing straight ahead.  On the teievision in front of them,
     a live picture of TRUMAN - the first time we have seen him
     broadcast to a viewer's set.

     He is reading a book at his kitchen table, unaware of the
     cameras recording him.

     The scene alternates between a wide master shot, a medium tight
     shot, a close up of Truman's face and two insert shots - one
     over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from
     another angle showing the book's title, "To The Ends Of The
     Earth - The Age Of Exploration".

     At one point, a sponsor's border appears on screen, tastefully
     framing the "action" with the message, "FOLGERS Coffee - Good To
     The Last Drop."  After several seconds, the border disappears.

     Suddenly tbe live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on the
     screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around
     the edge of the image.  Overlapping scenes from Truman's life
     appear in chronological order, from infancy to adolescence and
     finally adulthood.  A graphic, "TRUMAN - Total Record Of A Human
     Life", appears on screen accompanied by an introductory
     narration.

                           NARRATOR (O.C.)
              You are watching "Truman - Total Record Of
              A Human Life".  Everything that occurs here
              is real.  There are no re-creations or
              interruptions.  Due to the live and unedited
              nature of the program, viewer discretion is
              advised.

     The title sequence is replaced by an INTERVIEWER, mid-fifties,
     conservative suit and hair, sitting opposite CHRISTOF in a Larry
     King-style interview setting.  Projected in the background is
     the live picture of Truman, immersed in his book.


     INT.  STUDIO.  NIGHT.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (to camera)
              Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty
              eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have
              been a more momentous week in the show's
              history.  I'm your host, Michael Conners, and
              this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the
              forum where we discuss and analyze recent
              events with the show's award-winning creator
              and producer, Christof.
                      (referring to the image
                      of Truman in the background)
              I remind viewers that as this is a living
              history, it is our practise to keep the image
              of Truman on screen at all times.
                      (turning to Christof)
              Welcome.

                           CHRISTOF
              Thank you.

                           INTERVIEWER
              Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in
              ratings over the last few days, how do you hope
              to sustain that audience now that Truman appears
              to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?

                           CHRISTOF
              Ratings have never been our primary goal.  I
              imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested
              in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However
              I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.

                           INTERVIEWER
              But recent events have been so dramatic, it does
              raise the perennial question.  What keeps us
              watching one man twenty-four hours a day -
              eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in
              contemplation?

                           CHRISTOF
              It has to be the reality.

     During this segment, we cut to a cross-section of VIEWERS -
     the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the two OLD WOMEN on their sofa, the
     BARMAN and the WAITRESS - listening to Christof's theories on
     their viewing habits.

                           CHRISTOF
              We've become increasingly frustrated watching
              actors give us phony emotions, bored with
              pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the
              world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's
              nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts.
              no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but
              it's genuine.  That's how he can support an
              entire channel.

                           INTERVIEWER
              A window onto the human condition?

                           CHRISTOF
              I prefer to think of it as a mirror.  Not only
              does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he
              gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

                           INTERVIEWER
              But how do you account for the popularity of
              those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

                           CHRISTOF
              We find many viewers leave him on all night
              for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your
              child or your lover sleep?

                           INTERVIEWER
              Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

     The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his
     desk's high-tech phone terminal.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (into speaker phone)
              Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.

                           MALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
              Hello?

                           INTERVIEWER
              You're on, caller.  Go ahead.

                           MALE CALLER 1
              Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you.

                           CHRISTOF
              Thank you.

                           MALE CALLER 1
              Truman has never been closer.  The way he looked
              directly at us, spoke to us for the first time.
              Do you think he'll ever work it out?

                           CHRISTOF
              I don't believe so.  Not now.  He tested his
              world, as we all do at certain times, and
              eventually it passed the test.  You have to
              understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world
              he occupies his only frame of reference.
              No, for him to come even this close to the
              truth is a remarkable testament to his
              instincts.

     The Interviewer presses another line on his terminal.

                           INTERVIEWER
              Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk".

                           MALE CALLER 2 (O.C.)
              How much of a strain has the last few days
              placed on the actors?

                           CHRISTOF
              Working on "Truman" has always been a huge
              commitment for an actor, not just in terms
              of separation from friends and family, but
              since Truman essentially drives the plot,
              it's a never-ending improvisation.  Recent
              events have raised the pressure but also the
              prestige.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (cutting off the call)
              Of course Truman has always been very much in on
              casting.

                           CHRISTOF
              As with our own lives, the only people he can't
              cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final
              approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead
              role as was the case with his only real friend,
              Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit
              player.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (pressing another line)
              Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned
              videographer, Christof.

                           MALE CALLER 3 (O.C.)
              Christof.  I've admired your work my whole life,
              although I can't say I've seen it all.

                           CHRISTOF
              Who can?

                           MALE CALLER 3
              Can you settle an argument for me?  What's
              the longest time Truman has been off-camera?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (trace of pride)
              In his entire life, forty-two minutes.  A
              technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of
              that time.  The remainder generally results
              from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman
              would stray out of range of our cameras.

                           INTERVIEWER
              The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.
                      (pressing another line)
              Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk".

                           FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
              How can you say Truman lives a life like any other?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (sensing the thinly disguised
                      resentinent in the caller's voice)
              I believe that to be so.  I often feel the only
              difference between Truman's life and our own
              is that his is being more thoroughly documented.
              We all play our allotted roles--

                           FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
              --He's not a performer.  He's a prisoner.

     The Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof
     holds him back.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (rising to the challenge)
              --He can leave at any time.  If his was more
              than just a vague ambition, if he were
              absolutely determined to discover the truth,
              there's no way we could prevent him.  I think
              what really distresses you, caller, is that
              ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell"--

                           FEMALE CALLER 1
                      (as if trying to convince herself.
                      giving herself away)
              --No, you're wrong!  He'll prove you wrong!
              He can still do it!

                           CHRISTOF
                      (a thought occurring, looking
                      directly into camera)
              Do I know you, caller?  Your voice sounds familiar.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     SYLVIA, finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off
     the call, stares at CHRISTOF on her television screen.

     It is she who is the Female Caller.  Christof seems to stare
     back at her as the talk show continues.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (from television)
              Recording a human life from birth to death,
              that's still the intention?  You still believe
              Truman has more to contribute?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (still reflecting on the last call)
              More than ever.  By unwittingly allowing us to
              witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing
              us to evaluate our own lives.  He gives us hope.

                           INTERVIEWER
              Let's take another call.
                      (pressing a line)
              London, England you're on "Tru Talk".

                           FEMALE CALLER 2
              By definition Truman has to be free of censorship,
              but has the recent violence and profanity
              caused a problem for the sponsors...?

     Sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on
     the window that displays TRUMAN, still buried in his book.

     She comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy.  She
     has a camera and a white envelope in her hand.  With a look of
     resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes Truman's name
     on the envelope in her familiar blue ink.


     INT.  MASTER TAPE ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire,
     cavernous room - "Truman" and a date on the spine of each
     cassette.  Suspended from the ceiling, a monitor shows a live
     picture of TRUMAN sleeping on the sofa.

     Sitting in front of a playback monitor, CHLOE is transfixed by
     Truman thirty-four years earlier, a FETUS in his mother's womb.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              What are you looking for?

     Chloe tries to conceal her startlement at CHRISTOF's unexpected
     entrance.

                           CHLOE
                      (not taking her eyes from screen)
              He was premature, wasn't he?

                           CHRISTOF
              Only by two weeks.

                           CHLOE
              Curious even then?  Like he couldn't
              wait to get started?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (feeling out where the
                      conversation is headed)
              His eagerness to leave his mother's womb
              also meant he was the one selected.

                           CHLOE
              What was it like, the first show?

                           CHRISTOF
              The ultimate live television.  In competition
              with five other unwanted pregnancies - the
              casting of a show determined by an air date
              - he was the one who arrived on cue.

                           CHLOE
              Is it true what you said...on the show tonight?
              About letting him go if he wanted it badly
              enough.  Would you really do that?

     Christof stares at his assistant, weighing her loyalty.

                           CHRISTOF
              It won't come to that.


     INT.  OFFICE.  DAY.

     The suitably crestfallen TRUMAN stands in front of his boss,
     ERROL, sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk.  LAWRENCE
     lounges on the guest sofa, enjoying Truman's dressing-down.


     INT.  BANK.  DAY.

     TRUMAN approaches the bank window.  The teller is the YOUNG
     WOMAN whose child Truman attacked in the street.  She takes a
     step back at the sight of Truman, apprehensive, the
     confrontation fresh in her memory.

     Truman glances at the names on the checks in the young woman's
     hand, realizing how she was able to identify him in the street.
     He begins to apologize profusely.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN enters the garage, carrying Sylvia's sweater.  He
     breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it
     in the trunk.  With a sense of finality, he lowers the lid and
     fastens the lock.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN emerges from the garage, wheeling his lawnmower,
     deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house.

     Staring out of the kitchen window, a tall glass of iced tea in
     her hand, MERYL has been anticipating her husband's appearance.
     She wears a neckbrace, we sense more as a reminder to Truman
     than for any benefit she might derive.

     Feeling Meryl's eyes burning into his back, Truman fires up the
     mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section
     of grass.  We focus on the errant blades of grass as they are
     severed by the mower.  The lawn is now uniformly trimmed.

     From a mechanical platform above the Expressway, CHRISTOF and
     CHLOE watch Truman's final act of defiance laid to rest.


     INT.  OFFICE BUILDING, LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

     In an office building high above Manhattan's financial district,
     a ROBOTIC MANNEOUIN in a 3-piece suit stands at an upper-story
     window mechanically lifting a coffee cup to its mouth.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.

     In the street below, something is different about the rush-hour
     traffic.  The PEDESTRIANS are all standing around, no one
     walking.  Some are chatting with each other, others primping.
     The cars, vans and taxis are also idling.

     Camera locations are being checked.  A miniature camera
     inserted into the head of a streetlamp, a CAMERA TECHNICIAN
     waves his hand in front of an innocent-looking fire hydrant, the
     eye of a MDDEL on a bus shelter's cosmetic ad is wiped clean,
     the head of a parking meter is replaced, a buttonhole camera is
     placed on a BUSINESSMAN's double-breasted jacket by a TECHNICIAN
     - we see from the button's POV, a CONTACT LENS CAMERA is
     carefully inserted into the eye of Truman's colleague, LAWRENCE,
     another TECHNICIAN we observe from the contact's POV.

     Finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building
     and a TOURIST'S camcorder are positioned.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is seated at the control desk, directing the morning
     session, SIMEON assisting, CHLOE at his shoulder, a buzz of
     excitement in the room.

                           CHRISTOF
              I hope we've got fresh extras.

                           CHLOE
                      (consulting a clipboard)
              The rotation was made this morning.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring at a monitor, irritated)
              I don't like the couple with the baby.
              They'd never be together.

     The COUPLE with the stroller are promptly moved further along
     the street.

                           CHRISTOF
              Who's doing wardrobe?  I keep seeing the
              same wardrobe...


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN spills out of the subway car with hundreds of other
     COMMUTERS.  We hear Christof's off-camera voice, as always
     unheard by Truman.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              ...everybody back to One...

     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              ...and, action background...

     At the command, the PEDESTRIANS and VEHICLES begin inoving
     normally, TRUMAN exits the subway, suspecting nothing.  He
     begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour
     traffic.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              ...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog...
              let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept
              together...everybody look like you've got places
              to go...


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF covers his microphone to deliver an aside to SIMEON,
     from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director.

                           CHRISTOF
              I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.

     As predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's
     banner headline, "NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED".  Christof scans
     the shot options available to him on the video wall.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...Bodycam Two...

     The large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view
     of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.  For an instant, the unaware
     Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...streetlight eight...

     The monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp.  The
     camera continues to follow Truman's progress.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...ready, Car-Cam One.  Go to One...

     TRUMAN enters his office building as a taxi cruises by.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...and cut to interior...

     Truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside
     the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an
     ancient SECURITY GUARD.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...looser...

     The camera widens the angle.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...and action, Vivien...
                      (aside, proud of his casting)
              Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.

     VIVIEN, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at
     the same time as Truman.  However she reaches for it after
     Truman has already turned his back.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (incensed)
              Damn, she missed her mark!
                      (impatiently to Simeon)
              Why do we bother with walk-throughs if
              nobody pays attention?  Give me a two-shot
              of Truman and Vivien...go to the master
              ...hold the elevators...
                      (mustering patience, into microphone)
              Vivien, press the elevator button again
              ...and make sure you catch his eye this time...


     INT.  INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY.  DAY.

     A second time, TRUMAN's brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like
     clockwork.  As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator
     button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman.  The elevator
     car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she
     sachets into the lift.  For a moment he appears to glance at a
     piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           CHRISTOF
              Good!  Perfect!  Cut to the interior...

     The monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly
     filling with co-workers.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...and Lawrence...

     Just as the doors are about to close, LAWRENCE oozes in.  He
     gives Truman a smug smile.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...

     The elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (admiring aside to the remaining
                      fellow-males in the elevator)
              I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

     Truman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the
     comely young woman.  He is miles away.


     INT.  STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.

     Assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are
     several principal characters in Truman's life - MERYL, MARLON,
     ERROL, TYRONE, RAQUEL, VERONICA and the new actress, VIVIEN,
     sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast.

     CHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table, a large
     monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at
     American Life plays silently behind Christof's head.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (to the meeting, referring to
                      Meryl by her real name)
              Regrettably, I have to inform you that
              Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.

     All eyes turn to Meryl.  She looks at the floor.

                           CHRISTOF
              I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.

     Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co-
     star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit.

                           CHRISTOF
              Her separation from Truman will be
              orchestrated over the summer.
                      (more up-beat)
              However, I'm pleased to announce that
              television's first on-air conception will
              still take place.  You witnessed the initial
              contact this morning.
                      (glancing to Vivien, once
                      again using her real name)
              You all know Claudia from her work in theatre.
              Thankfully, Truman doesn't.

     The rest of the cast nod politely in Vivien's direction.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (referring to the bound documents
                      CHLOE passes to each cast member)
              This is a copy of Claudia's back story.
              Her character's name will be Vivien.
              She's the new adjuster at the office.

     The cast idly flip through the documents, prominently stamped on
     the cover, "NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET".

                           CHRISTOF
              We intend to entice Truman into the
              affair as soon as possible.  Claudia will
              make her advance at the seminar Truman's
              attending next week.  Details are in your
              schedules.  I'm sure you'll all make Claudia
              welcome.

                           MARLON
                      (injecting a note of levity, more
                      sophisticated than the character he plays)
              Question is, will Truman make her welcome?

     The cast snickers.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (immediately back to business)
              I don't have to tell you, how critical
              the next few weeks will be.  This takes us
              into the next generation.  When Truman's
              child is born, the network will be switching
              to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.

                           VIVIEN
              What happens when Truman and the baby are
              both on camera together?

                           CHRISTOF
              There will simply be duplicate coverage.

                           VIVIEN
                      (mischievous)
              Let's just hope we don't have twins.

                           CHLOE
                      (uncharacteristically flippant)
              When Truman dies do we go back to the
              single channel?

     The cast turn in her direction.  Christof has a second occasion
     to question his Assistant's loyalty.


     INT.  A BAR SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     The BARMAN, WAITRESS and PATRON we have seen before, observe
     TRUMAN on the television above the bar.  The cameras track
     Truman's progress, walking along Broadway.  As he ducks into a
     sex shop, the threesome at the bar exchange looks.  Inside the
     store, Truman appears apprehensive.

                           BARMAN
              What's he doing in there?

                           PATRON
              Meryl's at her mom's.  Maybe he's got an urge.

     On screen, Truman looks through some X-Rated video titles.

                           WAITRESS
                      (referring to Truman's overcoat)
              What's with the coat?

                           BARMAN
                      (smirking at the irony)
              Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized.

     Truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia, knocking an
     item to the floor.

                           PATRON
                      (remarking on Truman's clumsiness)
              Nervous.

     Truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store,
     the cameras following his journey as always.

                           BARMAN
                      (exasperated)
              Oh God, he never bought nothing.

                           WOMAN
              Give him a break.  It's taken him thirty-
              four years to get the nerve to go in there.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT

     We focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator, several
     pages long.  The kitchen itself is a bombsite.  More than the
     cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked
     haphazardly on the floor.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     The usually orderly bedroom is also a mess.  Blankets piled in a
     heap.  Several large, half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the
     room.  A chair in an odd position near the bed.  Clothes strewn
     everywhere.  Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered.

     TRUMAN is asleep in bed, the damaged waterbed replaced with a
     standard mattress.  Although he is completely covered from head
     to toe in bedding, the outline of his body is still clearly
     visible.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Close up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control
     room.  It displays a wide shot of Truman's darkened bedroom
     filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras.
     Assistant Producer, SIMEON, and his VIDEO OPERATORS slouch in
     their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen.
     Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner.

                           SIMEON
              ...Ready two.  Go to two.

     Operator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated
     buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close
     shot of Truman's covered head.  The camera stays on the
     blanketed head for a long moment.

                           SIMEON
              And back to the medium.

     Another button is pressed and the angle changes.  A trace of
     frustration is evident in the control room.  Recording a
     sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to
     contend with Truman's recently aquired camera-shyness.

                           SIMEON
              ...and wide...

                           OPERATOR
                      (aside to Simeon)
              Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?

                           SIMEON
                      (shrugs)
              That loser pays our salary.

                           OPERATOR
              He's given up on himself again.

                           SIMEON
              Who cares?  Makes life easier for us.
              He is what he is.

     At the far end of the great room, one of the large double
     doors opens and CHRISTOF enters, as always accompanied by CHLOE,
     carrying a leather-bound folder.  Simeon and the Operators
     subtely straighten in their chairs.  Christof pretends not to
     notice.  He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor.

                           CHRISTOF
              When did he start sleeping like that?

                           SIMEON
              About the time Meryl left.

                           CHRISTOF
              Is that the best shot we can get?

                           SIMEON
              What's to see?

     Christof watches Truman, a trace of concern in his eyes.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom)
              What happened to the room?

                           SIMEON
              He started to reorganize.  I was going to
              call you.  But half-way through, he gave
              up and fell asleep.

     Apparently satisfied, Christof turns to an operator.

                           CHRISTOF
              I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's
              insurance convention.

     Reading off the notes in Chloe's folder, the operator punches
     up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors.  They
     show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel, devoid of actors.  A
     banner in reception reads, "WELCOME AMERICAN LIFE & ACCIDENT".
     The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his
     producer's attention has wandered.  Christof is staring at the
     sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor.

                           CHRISTOF
              Give me a shot from his wedding band.

                           SIMEON
                      (pointing out the ring on Truman's
                      bedside table)
              He took it off.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (a trace of concern)
              Why is he so still?  He's too still.

     Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to
     his ear.

                           CHRISTOF
              Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.

     An operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel.  Christof and
     his colleagues listen to Truman's steady breathing in their
     headphones.  Simeon and the Operators nod, reassured that
     nothing is amiss.  Christof is not so easily convinced.

                           CHRISTOF
              Give me a preview.  An ECU on his torso.

     A camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to Truman's
     prone outline...while the breathing remains steady, the body
     does not rise and fall.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (anxious, barking a command to Chloe)
              Phone him.

     Chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials.

                           CHRI STOF
                      (anticipating Chloe's question)
              Wrong number.

     The phone on the bedside table, inches from Truman's head,
     begins to ring.  Truman doesn't flinch.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     SYLVIA walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a
     late night swim.  Hearing the telephone ringing; she rushes
     to pick it up.  However, after lifting the receiver, the phone
     continues to ring.

     The sound is coming from her television, left on in the bureau.
     On the screen, TRUMAN sleeps, seemingly undisturbed by the call.
     Sylvia, drying herself, watches with fascination.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF and the CREW are now highly agitated.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (a trace of panic)
              He didn't drink tonight?  No pills?

     Every question receives a shake of the Assistant's head in
     reply.

                           CHRISTOF
              Hang up!

     Chloe promptly cuts the connection and Truman's phone
     ceases to ring.

                           CHRISTOF
              Get Marlon over there.

                           CHLOE
              Under what pretext?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (letting his anxiety show)
              Any fucking pretext!

     Christof turns his back on the monitors, his mind racing.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     MARLON's car squeals to a halt outside Truman's house.
     Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest, he
     dashes barefoot to the front door.  He tries the doorhandle,
     pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously,
     shouting Truman's name all the while.

                           MARLON
              Tru!..Tru!..

     Frustrated, Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the
     window. He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but
     his shouts fail to rouse him.  Marlon picks up one of Meryl's
     carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window.

                           MARLON
                      (shouting a warning)
              I'm comin' in, Tru!

     Marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower
     of glass over Truman's bed.  Still he doesn't move.  Marlon
     reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the
     window frame and unlatches the window.


     NT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     MARLON clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands
     in an awkward heap on the floor beside TRUMAN's bed.

     He pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally
     stands at his co-star's bedside.  There is a hissing sound.
     Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover.  Beneath the bedding is a
     life-size inflatable female doll.

     The doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly
     deflating.  Lying beside the doll's chest is Truman's portable
     tape recorder.  Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next
     to his ear.  The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF, wide-eyed, stares at the image on the On-Air monitor
     of MARLON and his bizarre companion.  Marlon is frozen, staring
     into camera.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (quiet but firm)
              Cut transmission.

     Simeon hesitates, unsure if has heard correctly.  He looks to
     Christof for confirmation, his finger poised over an
     "EMERGENCY" button.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (enraged)
              I said, "Cut"!

     Christof lunges forward and presses the button himself.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     SYLVIA watches agog as the scene in Truman's bedroom on
     her television screen is replaced by the "TRUMAN" logo and the
     message, "TECHNICAL FAULT.  PLEASE STAND BY."


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF has taken his place at the control panel.  On the bank
     of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the OPERATORS
     systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Truman's
     home and neighborhood.  Occasionally MARLON or an EXTRA appear
     in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt.

     While the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card,
     Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor
     playing in fast-rewind, time code in the bottom right corner.
     It is a recording of the night's transmission.  Simeon stops on
     the last on-camera appearance by TRUMAN.

     They watch Truman, on-screen, switch off his bedroom light and
     climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers
     over his head.  As the light is switched off, the recording
     camera automatically switches to night vision.  Simeon continues
     to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast-
     forward mode.  Christof suddenly points to the screen.

                           CHRISTOF
              There.  Freeze...Zoom into the chair...

     Simeon types the appropriate command.

                           CHRISTOF
              Enhance.

     On the blown-up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg,
     it is barely possible to make out Truman's hand as he crawls
     commando-style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement
     already positioned in the bed.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (referring to the debris)
              He wasn't making a mess.  He was engineering
              a blind spot.

                           CHLOE
              How does he know where the cameras are?

                           CHRI STOF
              I don't know.
                      (noting the time-code on the monitor,
                      staring into the back of Simeon's head)
              All I know is we've been filming a blow-up
              doll for the last three hours.

     Simeon feels the hostility.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     The systematic search of the monitors continues.  They now
     reveal that dawn has broken on the set.

                           SIMEON
                      (hanging up the phone)
              We've declared a curfew.  Only the extras
              required for the search are on the set.
              Everyone else is at first positions.

                           CHRISTOF
              All prop cars accounted for?

                           SIMEON
              He has to be on foot.  He has the world's
              most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.

     All heads turn to CHLOE as she enters the grand control room
     with a status report.

                           CHLOE
              The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug
              if we don't make a statement within the next
              hour.  The media is in a feeding frenzy.  The phone
              lines are jammed.  Every network has a pirated shot
              of Harlon and the dummy.


     EXT.  VACANT LOT.  DAY.

     TRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his
     clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud.

     He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a
     shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags.
     Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his
     shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn.


     EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge.
     Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car
     approaching.  As it nears, we recognize a police car.

     Truman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in
     the search.  The car slowly draws alongside, the POLICE OFFICER
     looking straight into Truman's blackened face.

                           POLICE OFFICER
              Any sign of him?

                           TRUMAN
                      (deliberately gravelling his voice)
              Not yet.

     The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman.  After what
     seems like an eternity, he motions his PARTNER to drive on.

                           POLICE OFFICER
                      (to Truman, as the car pulls away)
              Take it easy.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  DAY.

     We pan down one concrete canyon after another.  The usually
     bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted.

     Suddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street.
     Then another and another.

     PEOPLE of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching
     down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted
     at a crime scene.  The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS
     linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES
     and SECRETARIES, STORE CLERKS, TELEPHONISTS, MAINTENANCE and
     CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WAITERS and WAITRESSES, COOKS, SHOPPERS,
     HEALTH WORKERS, SECURITY GUARDS, POSTAL WORKERS, POLICE
     OFFICERS, FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE.  On one occasion we
     glimpse Truman's colleagues, LAWRENCE, ERROL and VIVIEN, amongst
     the searchers.

     A building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search
     is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the
     searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such
     as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and
     shrubbery.

     We focus on one of the waves of searchers.  TRUMAN has linked
     arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up.

     A swarm of helicopters fills the sky.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     While his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens, CHRISTOF has
     been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives, MOSES and
     ROMAN.

                           MOSES
                      (to Christof who is still studying
                      the faces in a row of SEARCHERS)
              Rumors are circulating he's dead.

                           ROMAN
                      (pacing nervously)
              The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (unconcerned, referring to the static
                      "STAND BY" graphic, now accompanied by
                      soothing classical music)
              Why?  We're getting higher ratings for
              that graphic than any time in the series.


     INT.  BARROOM.  DAY.

     The television behind the bar carries the still graphic.
     BAR PATRONS animatedly discuss Truman's fate over their drinks.
     Some place bets with each other over the outcome.


     EXT.  ELECTRONICS STORE.  DAY.

     A crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions
     in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments.


     INT.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

     The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the
     graphic on their televisions.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     The fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to
     make another sweep.

                           CHLOE
                      (referring to the empty streets)
              When we flush him out how do we explain this?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (deadpan)
              We tell him the truth.

     Chloe looks askance at Christof.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (joking darkly)
              We're making a movie.

                           SIMEON
                      (hopeful)
              We'll get him on this next sweep.

                           CHRISTOF
              What have we missed?

                           SIMEON
              It's just a matter of time.

                           CHRISTOF
              No.  We've missed something.

     Christof turns his back on the screens.  Over his shoulder,
     we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN - PIER 13.  DAY.

     TRUMAN has broken away from the line of searchers, on the
     pretext of taking a leak.  He is standing on the edge of
     Pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning
     their next sweep.  Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green
     and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street
     Racquet Club.

     We see a close up of Truman's terrified eyes in his blackened
     face, staring down at the lapping water.  It triggers a montage
     of flashbacks.  As usual the images all appear to play on a
     television screen.

     TRUMAN on the CLIFF FACE at seven years old, his second grade
     teacher SISTER OLIVIA, a close-up of DROWNING STATISTICS at
     his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the FERRY
     TERMINAL, seventeen-year old SYLVIA jumping in the fountain, his
     WATERBED rocking, and seven-year old Truman sitting on the
     UPTURNED BOAT in Long Island Sound crying into the darkness.


     EXT.  PIER 13.  DAY.

     TRUMAN comes back to reality.  He steels himself, shuts out the
     doubts and dives into the water.


     EXT.  NEW YORK HARBOR.  DAY.

     Underwater we see TRUMAN panicking at the shock of the cold
     sea, arms and legs flailing.  Suddenly he stops and sinks for a
     moment in the weight of his clothes.  Then slowly he rises to
     the surface and begins to swim.

     Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus'
     flagship, The Santa Maria.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is spooling through significant scenes in the history
     of "TRUMAN" on a preview monitor.

     He pauses on the scene of SYLVIA and TRUMAN at the fountain
     in Flushing Meadow Park in the show's seventeenth season.
     Sylvia has her finger to Truman's lips.  Christof presses
     "PLAY" on the mixing desk.

                           SYLVIA
                      (from monitor)
              You remember when you were a little boy...

     Christof fast forwards, then presses PLAY once again.

                           SYLVIA
              ...Trust that boy...

     Christof jabs the "PAUSE" button, freezing the picture.  He
     recites the words to himself.

                           CHRISTOF
              Trust that boy...
                      (to Simeon)
              We're not watching the sea.

                           SIMEON
                      (confused)
              Why would we?

                           CHRISTOF
              Sweep the harbor.


     EXT.  NEW YOUR HARBOR.  DAY.

     TRUMAN is at the wheel of the Santa Maria, wind filling her
     sails.  Covering the face of the ship's compass is Sylvia's
     composite picture.

     His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor.  As the archaic
     vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget, the bridge
     appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight.  Truman steers
     around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the
     horizon.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on
     a preview monitor, skimming over the calm, featureless sea.
     Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched
     against the horizon.

                           SIMEON
              That's him!

                           CHRISTOF
              Resume transmission.

     Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is
     instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     SYLVIA, dozing on the sofa, suddenly blinks open her eyes as the
     classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the
     sound of a helicopte's rotor blade.

     Sylvia focuses on the screen, her breath taken away by the sight
     of TRUMAN at the wheel of the Santa Maria.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring intently at the On-Air monitor)
              What do we have on that boat?

     Simeon scans a computer shot list.  He types in a code.  A
     camera from the main mast of Truman's ship activates.  Truman,
     unaware of the camera, is concentrating on steering the vessel.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN is out of sight of land, the sea choppier now, rising
     and falling beneath his boat.  He nears a large buoy bobbing
     clumsily in the strong swell.  An official-looking sign is
     attached - "DANGER.  NAVAL EXERCISES.  DO NOT ENTER."  We see an
     extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised
     miniature camera tracks Truman's progress.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF and the other PRODUCTION STAFF watch TRUMAN from the
     buoy's POV as he sails by.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN hears a helicopter overhead.  By now the ocean spray has
     washed most of the dirt from his face, only a residue remains.
     The rags he wears, including Sylvia's sweater under his open
     coat, are soaked.  Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass.

     As he steers, he occasionally refers to a "HOW TO SAIL" book
     from his coat pocket.  He tacks against the wind, as he watches
     the military chopper circle his boat.

                           CHOPPER PILOT
                      (over P.A.)
              Alter course immediately.  You are
              entering a restricted area.

     Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper.

                           TRUMAN
              Fuck you!


     EXT.  A STREET SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     Two YOUNG MEN on a street corner watch, transfixed, the image
     of TRUMAN steering the Santa Maria on a portable Watchman TV.

                           YOUNG MAN 1
              I knew he wasn't dead.


     INT.  HELICOPTER.  DAY.


     The HELICOPTER PILOT continues to circle.

                           PILOT (over P.A.)
              Alter course or we fire on your vessel.

     TRUMAN screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the
     pilot.

                           TRUMAN
              Get the hell away!  It's my life!


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (into microphone to pilot, eerily composed)
              Fire a warning.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     A round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows
     of Truman's boat, several rounds striking the deck.  TRUMAN
     flinches.  In his eyes we see the ghosts return.  With great
     effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare
     gun from the storage cabinet in the boat's wheel house.

                           CHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.)
              Alter course.  Drop your sails.

     Truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun.  The
     distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter, narrowly
     missing.  Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           SIMEON
                      (shocked at the near miss)
              Jesus!  God!  Is he out of his mind?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (composed, into microphone to pilot)
              Pull back.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     Before the chopper can take evasive action TRUMAN takes aim a
     second time and fires.  The distress flare fishtails into the
     sky and to Truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark,
     striking the rear rotor blade.  Truman lets out a whoop.

     The helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards
     the sea.  The CHOPPER PILOTS bail out of the cockpit, splashing
     down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves
     in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like
     a stone.  Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in
     their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade Truman's
     head.  He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering
     away from the drifting pilots.  A look of resolve in his eyes we
     have never witnessed before.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     SYLVIA kneels on the floor in front of the television.  As
     Christof's cameras dwell on her likeness - the composite picture
     still covering the ship's compass - she allows herself a brief
     moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON, and the OTHERS have been joined in the
     control room by MARLON, MERYL, KIRK and AUDREY.

                           CHRISTOF
              How long will another chopper take?

                           SIMEON
              By the time we pick up the pilots, too long.

                           CHRISTOF
              We have to stop him for his own good.
              Turn him back with the elements.

                           SIMEON
                      (hesitant)
              There's no rescue boat in the area.  He
              won't know what to do.

                           MOSES
                      (trying to appeal to Christof's
                      sense of reason)
              For God's sake, Chris.  The whole world
              is watching.  We can't kill him in front
              of a live audience.

                           CHRISTOF
              He was born in front of a live audience.
                      (never taking his eyes from
                      the screen, reassuring)
              Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life
              for the truth.  His doubts will turn him back.

     Simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk
     marked "WAVE", "WIND" and "RAIN".  After typing in a command, he
     winds the controls towards their maximum settings.

                           CHRISTOF
              Kill the lights.

     Chloe searches Christof's face, trying to find the man in whom
     she has believed for so long.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     Darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards Truman's
     boat at an alarming speed.  High winds buffet the boat.  TRUMAN
     fights the wheel.  Hurricane force winds shake the masts and
     keel, ripping the sails to shreds.

     The picture of Sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the
     sea.  His "HOW TO SAIL" book skids off the deck.

     Truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes
     himself to the wheel to secure himself on board.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting above the storm)
              I'm coming to find you Sylvia!  I'm making
              myself deaf!
                      (screaming up to the sky)
              You're going to have to kill me!  Come on!

     Monstrous waves continually submerge the deck.  Truman continues
     to head into the teeth of the gale.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     In contrast to his panic-stricken COLLEAGUES, CHRISTOF gives an
     outward appearance of calm.  However a bead of sweat appearing
     at his temple betrays him.

                           SIMEON
                      (agitated)
              It's not working.  He can sail that thing!

                           ROMAN
              How can he sail?!  He's in insurance!  He
              hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven!

                           MOSES
                      (to Christof)
              On the behalf of the studio, I demand you
              cease transmission.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (defiant, to Operators)
              Keep running!
                      (to Moses)
              I take full responsibility.
                      (to Operator in front of radar-style screen)
              How close?

                           OPERATOR
              Very close.

                           CHRISTOF
              Capsize him!  Tip him over!

                           CHLOE
                      (unable to contain herself
                      any longer, entreating him)
              You can't!  He's tied himself to the wheel.
              He'll drown!

                           SIMEON
                      (staring at Truman on the monitor,
                      becoming affected by his display of courage)
              He doesn't care...

                           CHLOE
                      (to Christof, lunging for the control panel)
              You lied, you hypocrite!  The only way he can
              leave, is dead!

     Chloe lunges for the control panel but Christof throws her to
     the floor.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (enraged)
              Do it!

     All eyes turn in Christof's direction, as he confirms Chloe's
     accusation.

                           SIMEON
                      (staring at the On-Air monitor, numb)
              It's too late...


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN appears to be losing his fight against the storm,
     each successive breaker taking its toll on his body, sapping
     his strength, his bindings the only thing holding him upright,
     his head slumps, the wheel goes loose in his grasp, spinning
     out of control.  His will, draining away.

     As he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his
     arm into the handles of the spinning wheel.  He cries out in
     pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the
     wheel.  He braces for one last wave.

     But the wave does not come.  A strange phenomenon is occurring
     in the ocean.  A distinct division has appeared in the ocean
     swell.  Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of
     calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane.

     The wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting.
     Truman steers his vessel down this "sea-lane".

     After some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the
     horizon.  Land?  Islands?  As Truman steers towards the nearest
     shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations.
     It is certainly not the moon.

     The dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is
     exposed above the surface of the sea.  The ocean swell is being
     caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on
     either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed.
     In fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in
     both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see,
     the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers.

     Truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines.  The exposed
     half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its
     length equivalent to several football fields.  The massive arms
     perpetually churn.

     Truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly
     past the giant rotating drum.  The water beyond the rollers is
     dead calm.  Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his
     eyes.

     But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to
     comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that
     greets him.  His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow
     collision course with the sky.  That infinitely receding horizon
     line recedes no more.

     The sea really does meet the sky.  The join is only too
     apparent.  Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of
     colossal dimensions.  The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop.
     Truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the
     sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight.

     The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping
     gently into its latex surface.  Truman unties his bindings
     and stumbles across the deck to the side rail.  Clinging to the
     rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the
     painted cyclorama.  He touches the sky.

     He feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it.
     Hie eyes well up with tears.  He presses his distraught face
     into it.  He screams at the top of his voice.  No words.  A
     primal scream.  A pained, animal howl.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF and his PRODUCTION STAFF take in Truman's reaction
     in silence.


     INT/EXT.  BARROOM/ELECTRONICS STORE/HOME.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and
     streets - wherever a television is to be found.  No VIEWER
     speaks.  They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed.


     EXT.  CYCLORAMA.  DUSK.

     As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve
     of the cyclorama, TRUMAN's attention is drawn to an outline in
     the otherwise flawless backdrop.  He clambers to the prow of the
     boat.

     There, camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water
     line, is a door.  Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle
     and halts the drifting boat.  He stands in front of the door and
     closes his eyes in a silent prayer.

     He opens the door in the sky and steps through.


     INT/EXT.  VIEWERS.  DUSK.

     Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their
     various locations - bars, homes and offices.  Strangers hug each
     other and dance in celebration.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     Even the cynical VIDEO OPERATOR jumps out of his seat - for the
     first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop, forgetting
     himself for a moment, caught up in the drama.

                           OPERATOR
              Yeah!

     Self-conscious, he takes his seat again almost immediately.  His
     COLLEAGUES are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing
     to play its only available shot, the open door in the sky -
     Truman out of view.


     INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN finds himself on a small metal landing.  A steel ladder
     rises above him to the height of "sky", the soundstage roof, so
     high as to be barely visible.  The rungs also continue downward,
     the depth of the "ocean-bed", to a studio floor far below.

     Truman turns and looks back through the door he has just
     entered.  Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away.
     The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an
     enormous tank.  The sky, a massive cyclorama.  New York City, an
     elaborate set.  And it is all housed within an impossibly large
     soundstage.

     Truman makes no effort to save the boat.  He shuts the door to
     his world.  A sign on the back of the door reads, "CLOSED SET.
     No Unauthorized Access."  Gradually he becomes aware of another
     strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage.  All around
     him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to
     masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an
     automatic timer.  (The light fixtures match the one that almost
     struck Truman's car at the beginning of the film.)

     By artificial starlight, Truman begins his long descent of the
     step ladder.  Below, a studio tram makes its way along the
     soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day.


     INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.

     As he drives, a well-scrubbed, young TOUR GUIDE delivers his
     tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to
     the half-full tram of STUDIO VISITORS.

                           GUIDE
              ...the soundstage roof houses over eight
              hundred thousand lights of varying intensities
              to faithfully recreate the constellations...

     However, the passengers are paying less attention than usual.
     They stare, perplexed, at the television monitor above the
     Guide's head, continuing to play the show's only available shot
     of the open door in the sky.


     INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN suddenly steps in front of the tram.  The TOUR GUIDE
     stands on the brakes, tram lurching to a stop.  The Guide looks
     from Truman's haunted face to the monitor, hardly able to
     believe his eyes.

     Truman leaps on board, pressing his flare gun into the side of
     the guide's head.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the shocked passengers)
              Nobody move!
                      (to the guide)
              Drive!

     The terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram, resuming the
     tour.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the guide, gesturing to the microphone)
              Keep talking.  Say whatever you say!

     The Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone.

                           GUIDE
               Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred
               and fifty million gallons of man-made salt
               water, temperature-controlled...

     Truman's attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram -
     "TRUMAN STUDIO TOUR".  He is suddenly aware of the tourists
     gawking at him.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to TOURIST, camcorder around his neck)
              Act normal!  Keep filming!

     Truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of STUDIO SECURITY CARS
     speeds towards the tram.  But they streak past, on their way to
     the site of Truman's escape.  As he tentatively gets back to his
     feet, Truman finds a CHILD standing in front of him with an
     autograph book.

                           CHILD
              Please, Mister Truman.

     On the child's T-shirt, a large photograph of Truman's face.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF talks anxiously on the phone, unaware of a shift in the
     balance of power taking place behind his back.  The executives,
     MOSES and ROMAN are huddling with SIMEON, making him an offer he
     appears to welcome.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (into the phone)
              What do you mean he's not there?  We can't
              have lost him again.

     On the far side of the control room, behind a huge curved
     glass wall on a mezzanine floor, a studio tour tram passes by.


     INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN crouches behind a seat on the tram, flare gun still
     trained on the guide's head, taking in the gigantic video wall
     displaying pictures from every facet of his life.

     His heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private
     spot where he and SYLVIA met.

                           GUIDE
              ...on your left, the control room where the
              angles are selected and the actors receive
              direction.  Of course, the one place we can't
              show you is the story department.  There is none.
                      (hesitant)
              ...Truman writes the script...

     From Truman's POV we watch CHLOE approach CHRISTOF.  She has a
     pure white envelope in her hands.  As Christof looks up to
     acknowledge her, he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the
     tram.


     INT.  STUDIO LOT.  DUSK.

     Still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard
     of an indoor shopping mall.  Truman gift shops.

     TRUMAN is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays
     full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles
     such as, "TrumanTrivia".  Video cassettes offering "Truman
     Highlights".  His face emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, coffee mugs
     and posters.  Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying
     Oldsmobile are offered for sale.

     The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end.
     STUDIO POLICE are checking the disembarking PASSENGERS.  Truman,
     using the TOUR GUIDE as a shield, also exits the tram.

                           GUIDE
                      (frightened for his life)
              Here he is!  It's him!

     Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and
     makes a run for it.  The guards give chase.  Truman runs into a
     lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his
     own, promoting "TrumanWear".  He pulls his "double" to the
     ground to block the guards' path.

     Sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end.

                           GUARD
                      (into radio)
              We've got him trapped.

     Truman enters a doorway marked "NO ENTRY" to find a stairway
     leading upwards.  He takes the stairs three at a time.

     The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind.  Flight
     after flight of stairs.  At one point, he loses his grip on the
     stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for
     an eternity down the stairwell.

     He finally emerges on a landing.  Lungs bursting.  One more
     door.  He tries the handle.  It opens.


     EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN finds himself on the roof of the soundstage.  Outside.
     Really outside for the first time in his life.

     He looks frantically around him.  Nowhere to hide.  The
     soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the
     eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof.

     Facing him, a colossal Burbank.  Several other soundstages
     almost as gigantic as his own.  The palm trees lining the
     streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns.

     The Hollywood Freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of
     traffic, twenty lanes wide.  Gargantuan office buildings
     eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known.

     Directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its
     arched entranceway.

     Above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky.  The real
     moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating
     for the last thirty-four years.

     Truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone.  A
     GROUP has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent
     in a semi-circle, cutting off any escape.

     Along with the STUDIO GUARDS, keeping their distance in the
     background, are CHLOE, SIMEON, and the two studio executives,
     MOSES and ROMAN.  In front of them, the co-stars in his life -
     MARLON, MERYL, sister RAQUEL, mother AUDREY and supposedly dead
     father KIRK.  No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the
     familiar faces.  Marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the
     eye.

     Truman's gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing
     at the head of the group.  CHRISTOF.  He approaches Truman
     alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a
     father calls to a son.

                           CHRISTOF
              Truman...

     Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his
     life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time.  As they
     stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first
     time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof.  For a
     moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky.

                           TRUMAN
                      (quietly, half to himself,
                      half to Christof)
              Even the stars I wished on...

     As Truman turns his attention back to Christof, he suddenly
     lunges at him, catching him off-guard, the envelope slipping
     from Christof's hand.  With a strength he never knew he
     possessed, Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage
     roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world.

     Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself.  The
     studio guards dare not move.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring into the chasm,
                      remaining eerily calm)
              You won't do it, Truman.  I've watched you
              your whole life.

                           TRUMAN
                      (meeting Christof's gaze)
              You never had a camera in my head.

     Suddenly the doubts flood into Christof's eyes, fearing he
     has misjudged Truman, fearing for his life.

                           TRUMAN
                      (incensed)
              Something was real!
                      (a terrifying anguish)
              Something had to be real!

     It takes all of Truman's will not to hurl the old man into the
     abyss.  Christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white
     envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in
     the moonlight.

     Truman follows Christof's gaze.  Contemptuously tossing Christof
     aside, he retrieves the envelope.  Christof crawls to safety,
     thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and
     insignificant.

     But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer
     exist in Truman's mind.  Truman gazes at his name for a long
     moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully
     breaks the seal.  Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to
     be slowly revealed.  A photograph.  A close up of SYLVIA's face
     including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever-elusive nose.

     A serenity comes over Truman.  He lifts up his eyes to the
     mountains on the far horizon.  As he stands on the very edge of
     the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we
     commence a long, slow pull-back.

     Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall
     of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic
     picture of his face and proclaiming, "TRUMAN - Total Record of a
     Human Life.  34TH GREAT YEAR!"

     We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on
     top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame.


     A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS

     The two OLD WOMEN in the living room, the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the
     two YOUNG MEN with the Watchman TV, the PATRONS in the bar,
     PASSERS-BY outside an electronics store are all captivated by
     their television sets.

     We focus on the screen of a television.  A small FEMALE BABY
     sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Truman's old
     suburban home in Queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his
     life.  The infant's doting parents, MARLON and the new actress
     VIVIEN, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child.  A border
     around the action on the screen announces, "ZOE - Total
     Record Of a Human Life".

     Suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen.
     A BABY stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the
     television set in Sylvia's house.

     TRUMAN bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the
     air, much to the child's delight.  Truman dwells for a moment
     on the mirror-image scene on the television before very
     deliberately shutting it off.

     SYLVIA joins Truman and their daughter.  Together, they exit
     the beach house.  We follow them as they make their way onto the
     deserted sand and down towards the sea.

                      without consenting to lose sight
                      of the shore for a very long time."

                                     Andre Gide

     The title fades off, replaced by a second title.

                      "We're all in this alone."

                                     Lily Tomlin


     INT.  A WOMB.  DAY.

     A fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he
     gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of
     his mother's womb.  We focus on the unborn's hand, already a
     tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed
     lips.  He sucks his thumb.


     INT.  HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY.

     A seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached,
     smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up
     by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera.  Shocked by
     the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the
     newborn fights for his first, arduous breath.  Following almost
     immediately, a cry.

     From another angle we see the crying infant on a television
     screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible.

     MATCH DISSOLVE TO


     INT.  CAR - UTOPIA, QUEENS.  MORNING.

     The face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying.
     TRUMAN BURBANK, thinning hair, a body going soft around the
     edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the
     wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.  He
     cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears.

     Pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban
     street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and
     lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in
     front of his idling car.

     Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate.  Amidst a sea of
     shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism.

     He looks around him but the street is deserted.  He checks that
     all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though
     the fallen fixture is far larger.  He looks up into the sky but
     there is no plane in sight.  With some effort, Truman picks up
     what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of
     his car and drives away.


     INT.  CAR - TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of
     a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into
     his Styrofoam cup of coffee.  Stirring it in with his finger, he
     burns himself.

                           TRUMAN
              Shit!

     As Truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of
     children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School,
     adjacent to the parking lot.  The sound of the children triggers
     a memory in his head.


     EXT.  LONG, WIDE BEACH.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears
     to be playing on a television screen.

     A sandy-haired, SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, runs towards a bluff on
     the beach.

     The boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand,
     flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.  Suddenly, the
     father remembers his son.  He looks anxiously around.  The sight
     of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his
     bottle in the sand and run to him.

     The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father
     comes within earshot.

                           FATHER
                      (out of breath, clutching his side)
              Truman!  Truman!  Stop!

     Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his
     father.  But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the
     anger and distress on his father's face.

                           FATHER
              Come down now!

     His father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more
     tantalizing.  The boy considers defying his father.  He puts
     his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at
     the other side.  One good stretch would do it.

                           FATHER
                      (reading Truman's mind, enraged)
              No!

                           TRUMAN
                      (sensing his father is keeping
                      something from him)
              Why?  What's there?

                           FATHER
                      (unconvincing)
              Nothing's there.  It's the same as this.
                      (trace of desperation)
              Come down, please!

     Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other BEACHGOERS
     have stopped their activities to stare at him.  Reluctantly
     he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks.  When he finally
     jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and
     drags him away down the beach.

                           FATHER
              I told you to stay close.  Don't ever leave
              my sight again.  You gotta know your
              limitations.  You could've been washed
              away by the tide.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks
     briskly down the bustling street.  A snarl of taxis, buses and
     COMMUTER traffic.  A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under
     Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye.

     Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of
     Cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy
     pages.  Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and
     finding him busy with another customer, Truman deftly tears a
     portion of the open page and pockets the cutting.

     He guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the
     Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him.

                           TRUMAN
                      (quickly recovering)
              Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald".

                           VENDOR
              We ran out.

                           TRUMAN
                      (hastily departing)
              Thanks anyway.

     As Truman hurries away, the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo
     and instantly turns to the torn page.  It is a Lancome
     advertisement with ISABELLA ROSSELLINI's nose missing.
     Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to
     confront him, almost as if he were expecting it.

     Passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow
     out of the pavement, Truman glimpses himself in the reflective
     glass.  He doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his
     gut, but quickly concedes defeat.  The image triggers another
     childhood memory.


     INT.  SCHOOLROOM.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television
     screen.

     The sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of
     a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or-
     so other well-scrubbed, uniformed YOUNGSTERS.  DOUGLAS, the boy
     next to Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty-
     year-old NUN with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched.

                           DOUGLAS
              I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.

                           SISTER
                      (impressed)
              Tell the class what a chiropractor does,
              Douglas.

                           DOUGLAS
              He helps people by fixing their backs,
              Sister Olivia.

                           SISTER
              That's right, Douglas.
                      (holding her back, hamming it up)
              Perhaps I'll be your first patient.

     The CLASS titters.  Douglas sits down, pleased with himself,
     throwing a smirk to Truman.

                           SISTER
              What about you, Truman?

     Truman rises to his feet.

                           TRUMAN
              I want to be an explorer
                      (with reverence)
              ...like Magellan.

     The Sister's face falls.

                           SISTER
              No one's going to pay you to do that,
              Truman.
                      (with scarcely disguised glee)
              Besides, you're too late.  There's
              nothing left to explore.

     The class roars with laughter and Truman takes his seat.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.

     From TRUMAN'S POV we see that he is staring up at relief
     letters that proclaim, "American Life & Accident Insurance,
     Inc." above an office building's entrance.

     A POLICE OFFICER walking his beat, wanders in Truman's
     direction.  From another angle, we observe Truman from the
     Police Officer's POV - shaky, handheld camera - on a television
     screen.  Truman enters the building.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY - TWELFTH FLOOR.  DAY.

     In a cramped, cluttered, windowless cubicle, TRUMAN talks on
     the telephone.

                           TRUMAN
                      (into receiver)
              ...okay, okay, let's call it what it is...
              I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance
              is death insurance...you just gotta ask
              yourself two questions...one, in the event
              of your death, will anyone experience
              financial loss?...and two, do you care?

     A CLERK drops a large reference book on Truman's desk.  He
     checks the spine - "MORTALITY STATISTICS, 1986 to Present".

                           TRUMAN
                      (into receiver)
              Hold on will ya?
                      (to Clerk, putting receiver
                      to chest, referring to the book)
              This's no good.  Lumps all drownings
              together.  I need drownings broken down
              by category.

     The Clerk shrugs, returns the book to his trolley and continues
     his rounds.

                           TRUMAN
                      (returning to his call)
              ...just think about what I've been
              saying and lemme...hello?...

     The person on the other end has hung up.  With an apathetic
     shrug, Truman replaces the receiver.  He looks over his shoulder
     and places another call.

                           TRUMAN
                      (lowering his voice)
              Can you connect me with directory
              inquiries in Sydney, Australia?
                      (a long delay makes Truman
                      even more uncomfortable)
              ...er, yes.  Do you have a listing
              for a Lauren Powers...
                      (pause)
              ...nothing listed?...what about a Sylvia
              Powers...nothing?  Thanks...

     Truman replaces the receiver, disappointed.


     INT.  LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.  LUNCHTIME.

     TRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR
     WORKERS.  As he reaches the counter, the store owner, TYRONE,
     has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a
     meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll.  Truman gazes
     at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own
     predictability.

                           TYRONE
                      (nauseatngly cheerful)
              How's it goin', Truman?

                           TRUMAN
                      (deadpan)
              Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

                           TYRONE
                      (not listening to Truman's
                      reply, as Truman anticipated)
              Good.  Good.

                           TRUMAN
              Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?

                           TYRONE
                      (not missing a beat)
              I'd ask for identification.

     Truman forces a half-smile.

     We focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash
     register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye.  About
     to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke
     from the FEMALE CASHIER.

                           FEMALE CASHIER
                      (a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing)
              He's right there.  You're supposed to pay
              when he's here.

                           MALE CUSTOMER
                      (nonchalant shrug as he departs)
              He never notices.

     We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped
     sandwich from Tyrone.

                           TYRONE
              Hold on, Truman.  I got somethin' to show ya.

     Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that
     features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus'
     Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline.  Truman's
     eyes widen at the photograph.

                           TYRONE
                      (referring to the photo)
              The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese
              navigator, huh?  I know you love this like me.

                           TRUMAN
                      (averting his eyes with difficulty)
              Not me.  You got the wrong man.

     Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays
     the Cashier and exits.

                           TYRONE
              See ya tomorrow, Truman.


     EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.

     TRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park.
     From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, "To The
     Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration".

     A TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout.
     Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders
     and gives him it all, his appetite gone.  As the transient
     wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book.


     INT.  A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     Close up on an old man's face.  CHRISTOF.  Hair pure white,
     late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years.

     He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room.
     Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep
     blue Californian sky.  A news anchor-style earpiece disappears
     down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears.

     Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television
     monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed
     in his book, silently plays.

     CHLOE, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited,
     joins Christof at the window.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (never taking his eyes
                      from the monitor)
              You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the
              road?  They're pulling out a body.  You know
              you shouldn't look, but you do.


     INT.  A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around
     a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting
     room.  All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of
     the table, anticipating a call.  On cue, the phone rings and one
     of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up.

                           MAN
              Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough
              insurance.

     He hangs up.  After a moment the phone rings again.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call.

                           TRUMAN
                      (into receiver)
              ...this isn't about insurance, this is
              about the great variable - when will
              death occur?  Could be a week, a month,
              a year.  Could happen today...A sunbather,
              minding his own business, gets stabbed in
              the heart by the tip of a runaway beach
              umbrella...No way you can guard against
              that kinda thing, no way at all...

     The prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs
     up.  Truman's supervisor, LAWRENCE, younger than Truman by
     several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the
     corner of the cubicle.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (handing Truman some documentation)
              Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in
              Stapleton I need you to cloes by four.

     Truman turns pale.

                           TRUMAN
              Stapleton on Staten Island?

                           LAWRENCE
                      (sarcastic)
              You know another one?

                           TRUMAN
              I can't do it.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (insistent)
              A half hour across the bay.  Sea air.  Do
              you good.

                           TRUMAN
              No, I...
                      (searching for a plausible excuse)
              ...I got an appointment uptown.

                           LAWRENCE
              This is a sure thing.
                      (conspiratorial)
              They're upping our quota.  You need this.

     Lawrence exits the cubicle.  Truman's head drops.  He picks up
     the framed picture of his wife from his desk.  MERYL, early
     thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail.  He deposits
     the photo in his briefcase and departs.


     INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.

     TRUMAN, briefcase in hand, ashen-faced, stands in line for the
     Staten Island ferry.

     As the TOURISTS and COMMUTERS impatiently brush past him onto
     the boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the
     scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering
     a flashback in his head.


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     The flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the
     SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits alongside his father, KIRK, in a
     small sailing dinghy.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting above the wind)
              Let's go further, daddy!  Let's go further!

                           FATHER
                      (shouting back)
              It's getting late, Truman.

                           TRUMAN
                      (entreating his father)
              Please!...

     Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading
     towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon.


     INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.

     TRUMAN turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide
     of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street
     into the bright sunlight, gasping for air.

     Gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street
     subway station.  Two COMMUTERS surrepticiously observe Truman as
     he departs.

                           COMMUTER 1
                      (commenting out of Truman's earshot)
              I can't believe he's taking the long way.

                           COMMUTER 2
              He'll never make it.


     INT.  SUBWAY TRAIN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN stands in a packed subway car, anxiously glancing at his
     watch, wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief.


     INT. TAXI.  DAY.

     A taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten
     Island.  TRUMAN keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across.
     refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor.


     EXT.  BAY STREET, STATEN ISLAND.  DAY.

     TRUMAN finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do
     condominium on Bay Street.  As he approaches the lobby, he
     realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his
     suit jacket.


     INT.  CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     A middle-aged CONCIERGE behind a reception desk, is having his
     hair brushed by a YOUNGER MAN in his mid-thirties.  Anticipating
     Truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and
     swiftly departs through a rear door.  TRUMAN enters the lobby
     and approaches the CONCIERGE, trying to keep his arms tightly at
     his sides to hide the perspiration.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.

                           CONCIERGE
              You from the insurance company?  You missed him.

                           TRUMAN
              When will he be back?

                           CONCIERGE
              Vacation.  Two months.  He waited as long as
              he could.  You was supposed to be here by four.

     A clock on the wall reads 4.l2pm.


     INT.  SUBWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     TRUMAN sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated.
     The only other occupants in the train, a TALL WOMAN, mid-
     thirties, reading a pulp novel and two MALE YOUTHS, late-teens,
     sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her.

                           YOUTH 1
                      (to woman)
              You wanna read to me?

     His companion smirks.

                           YOUTH 1
                      (more insistent)
              You wannna read to me?

     The woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now.
     She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book.  The
     other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp.

                           YOUTH 2
                      (menacing)
              My friend asked you a question.

     The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and
     holds it to her.  She looks around the train for assistance,
     briefly catching Truman's eye.  The youths also look in
     Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere.
     Truman quickly averts his gaze.

                           WOMAN
                      (reaching for the book)
              Please...

     The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips
     out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt
     pocket.

                           YOUTH 2
              Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.

     The train pulls into a deserted station.  Feeling vulnerable,
     the woman jumps up from her seat and exits.  The youths, sensing
     a chase, also exit.  Scanning the empty platform, the woman
     realizes she has made a serious error.  Truman watches through
     the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman
     but still he remains in his seat.

                           YOUTH 1
              We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.

     One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it
     in the woman's face.

                           YOUTH 2
              Don't you wanna know how it ends?

     The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of
     their bodies.  The woman looks again in Truman's direction.
     Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading.

                           WOMAN
                      (screams)
              Help!!  Please, help!!

     The woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes.
     Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door.  There
     is still time to act.  He stands up and half-reaches for the
     handle but moves no further.

     The train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of
     the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches
     under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel.  Truman bows
     his head in shame as the train rattles on.


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  DAY.

     The train safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release the
     WOMAN.  She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid.
     The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve
     her shoulder bag.

                           WOMAN
              Thanks.

     The threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong
     friends.

                           WOMAN
                      (pondering the incident)
              He did nothing.

                           YOUTH 1
                      (shrugs, suddenly more couth)
              Physical violence paralyzes him.  Always
              has.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DUSK.

     The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home.  Beyond
     the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy
     Expressway.

     TRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, MERYL,
     pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry.  She has a
     sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new
     knife-set in a wooden block.  She kisses Truman affectionately
     on the cheek.

                           MERYL
                      (proudly referring to the knife-set)
              I got it free with the tune-up.

     Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch
     of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes.

                           MERYL
              You missed a section.

     Meryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and
     obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As
     the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass,
     Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for
     Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY.

     MERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to her hands)
              Do they hurt?

                           MERYL
              I was afraid I'd seize up during cross.
              One of the keys kept sticking.

     Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.  He
     notes an article headlined, "SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK".

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to the article)
              Is he gonna take the stand?

                           MERYL
                      (dispassionate, matter-of-fact)
              No point.  Two eye witnesses saw him
              near the dumpster where they found the legs.

     She flexes her arthritic wrists.

                           MERYL
              You gonna eat before you leave?

                           TRUMAN
              I'll get something out.

                           MERYL
                      (sensing something odd
                      in his demeanor)
              Did something happen today?

     Truman turns to her too sharply, his guilt showing.

                           TRUMAN
                      (composing himself)
              What could happen?


     EXT.  UNOPENED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.

     An abandoned freeway project in Queens.  The four hundred yard
     stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked.  At one end
     is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air, reinforcing steel
     protuding from the concrete.

     TRUMAN stands at the end of the off-ramp with MARLON, thirty-
     two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big.
     Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up
     golf ball with a number three wood.

     Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the
     ball.  The ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the
     adjacent operating roadway.  From a new angle we see the ball
     take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and
     continue down the asphalt.

     Marlon tosses Truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred
     golf balls - a ball initialed with the letter, "T".  Truman sets
     the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into
     his second shot.  With a slight fade, the second ball carries
     even further than the first.

     Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment.
     Marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot.

                           MARLON
              Ouch.  Whose nuts were those?

                           TRUMAN
                      (opening a beer from the six pack)
              Mine.

     Marlon tees up a ball of his own. initialed with the letter "M".

                           TRUMAN
              I gotta get out, Marlon.

                           MARLON
                      (mild interest only)
              Yeah?  Outta what?

                           TRUMAN
              Outta my job, outta Queens...out!

     Marlon takes a practise swing.

                           MARLON
              Outta your job?  What the hell's wrong
              with your job?  You gotta great job.
              You gotta desk job.  I'd kill for a desk
              job.

     Marlon addresses the ball and swings.  A sweeping hook shot
     that bounces off the freeway out of bounds.

                           MARLON
                      (annoyed by the errant tee shot)
              Sonofabitch.

                           TRUMAN
              It doesn't mean anything.

                           MARLON
                      (still looking in the
                      direction of his ball)
              Nothing means anything.  Try stocking vending
              machines for a living.  My biggest decision
              of the day is whether the Almond Joys look
              better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.

     Truman selects another "M" ball from the bucket and tosses it to
     Marlon.

                           TRUMAN
                      (adamant)
              I gotta get out.

     Overcompensating with his second shot, Marlon slices the ball in
     the other direction.  A lucky bounce keeps it on the cement
     fairway.

                           MARLON
                      (skeptical, picking up his beer)
              Sure and go where?

     Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer.

                           TRUMAN
                      (unable to disguise his reverence)
              Australia.

                           MARLON
                      (impressed)
              No shit.  Where is Australia exactly?
              Near England?

     Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate.  He points to a
     dimple on his make-shift globe.

                           TRUMAN
              See here, this is Queens.
                      (sliding his finger around
                      the other side of the ball)
              All the way round here, Australia.  You
              can't get any further away before you start
              coming back.
                      (tossing the world in his hand,
                      warming to his subject)
              Y'know, there're still places in Australia
              where no human being has ever set foot.

                           MARLON
                      (still dubious)
              So when are you leaving?

                           TRUMAN
              It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.
              You can't just up and go.
                      (heading off Marlon's skepticism)
              Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about
              that.  I just gotta move slow.  Pick a
              moment.  Bonus time's just around the
              corner.  Soon as I get a retaining wall
              built on the back of the house I can
              start thinking about selling up...and I'll be
              gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.
                      (as if to convince himself)
              I'm going, don't you worry about that.

     Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond
     his imagination.

                           MARLON
              I never knew anybody who got out.

     An awkward moment.  Truman, once again, not so sure of himself.
     He masks his doubt by teeing up another ball.

     DISSOLVE TO


     EXT.  FREEWAY.  LATER THAT NIGHT.

     TRUMAN and MARLON wander down the empty freeway, retrieving
     the golf balls.  As they return them to the bucket they check
     the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their
     long-drive competition.

                           TRUMAN
                      (slightly the worse for drink)
              Tick-fucking-tock.  That's the fucking
              problem, Marlon.  I'm thirty-four.  I'm
              older than Jesus Christ.

     Marlon looks sideways at Truman.  It sounds to him like the beer
     talking.

                           TRUMAN
              Where do the dreams go, Marlon?

                           MARLON
                      (picking up the last ball marked with an
                      initial "T", trying to ignore the question)
              You win.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm serious.  Where do the dreams go?

                           MARLON
                      (humoring his maudlin friend)
              They're still there.  Just buried under what
              we settled for.

     They approach Truman's Oldsmobile.  Truman opens the trunk to
     deposit their humble golfing equipment.  Inside are the remains
     of the fallen light fixture.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to the light)
              You really think it could've dropped off an
              airliner?

                           MARLON
                      (unimpressed)
              Sure.  It's halogen.  You oughta report it.
                      (quickly changing the subject)
              You coming for a drink?

                           TRUMAN
              I can't tonight.


     EXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     The lines of a television screen signal another of Truman's
     flashbacks.  A small group of MOURNERS in black, several openly
     weeping, stand on the end of a small jetty, including the SEVEN-
     YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit, his weeping
     MOTHER, older sister, RAQUEL, and a PRIEST at the head of the
     gathering.

     The priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath, heavy and
     cumbersome in his tiny hands.  He heaves it off the dock.

     MATCH DISSOLVE TO


     EXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT, LONG ISLAND.  NIGHT, PRESENT.

     A smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water
     beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later.  TRUMAN stares at the
     wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the
     shoreline.

     In his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand.
     He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and
     points a corded microphone at the surf.  For a long while we
     watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the
     lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible
     through the gloom.

     We focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse.  From the
     light's POV, through the green hue of a night vision camera, we
     observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting at the surf)
              I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!


     INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF's dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a
     television monitor that displays the distraught TRUMAN at the
     water's edge.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     At the Formica kitchen table, TRUMAN makes calculations in a
     school notebook, a bottle of beer close at hand.  MERYL appears
     in her robe, a glimpse of black negligee beneath, restless.  She
     throws her arms around Truman's neck.

                           MERYL
                      (suggestive)
              What are you doing?  Come to bed.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring the suggestion)
              I figure we could scrape together eight
              thousand.

                           MERYL
                      (suddenly exasperated)
              Oh.  God, everytime you and Marlon--

                           TRUMAN
              --We could bum around the world for a year
              on that.

                           MERYL
              And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to
              where we were five years ago.  You're talking
              like a teenager.

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe I feel like a teenager.

     Getting to his feet.  Truman holds Meryl by the arms, talking
     excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were
     courting.

                           TRUMAN
              Meryl, it'd be an adventure.

                           MERYL
              We said we'd try for a baby.  Isn't that
              enough of an adventure?

                           TRUMAN
              That can wait.  I want to get away.  See
              some of the world.  Explore.

     Meryl gives a derisive laugh.

                           MERYL
              You want to be an explorer?  You mean like
              all the other great explorers from Queens?
              You don't even have a passport, Truman.  I
              bet you don't even know how to get one.

     The words sting.  Truman turns away.

     Seeing the pain she's caused, she changes tack.

                           MERYL
              This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this
              now and then.
                      (making one more attempt
                      at seduction)
              Come to bed.


     EXT.  A NIGHTWATCHMAN'S OFFICE SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     In a nightwatchman's office, two UNIFORMED GUARDS drink coffee.

                           GUARD 1
              How can they have a child?

                           GUARD 2
              It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

                           GUARD 1
              Why not?

                           GUARD 2
              You think she'd go through with it?
                      (reassessing his own opinion)
              Guess I always thought they'd adopt.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     TRUMAN stands in the darkened bedroom in his Hanes underwear
     looking down at his bed.  MERYL has fallen asleep waiting for
     him, snoring lightly.  Truman rests his hand tentatively on the
     bed.  The surface rocks.  A waterbed.  The motion triggers a
     flashback in his head.


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAWN, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen.
     The SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits on the upturned hull of a small
     dinghy in calm, deep water.

                           TRUMAN
                      (plaintively calling into the mist)
              Daddy!!...Daddy!!...

     His cries go unanswered.


     INT.  A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     Two OLD WOMEN, seventies, sit beside wach other on a sofa
     against a bare wall, looking directly into camera as they
     talk.  Nothing else of the room is seen.

                           OLD WOMAN 1
                      (playing amateur psychiatrist)
              It left him with more than his obvious fear
              of the water.  It's as if he felt his father
              had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed
              never to repeat the mistake.  He was never
              the same curious little boy again.

                           OLD WOMAN 2
              We're all born with a pound of cocaine
              up our nose.  By the time we're eleven
              it runs out.

                           OLD WOMAN 1
              Half the people I knew named their
              babies after him.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the
     newspaper stand. He picks up a copy of Vogue and flips through
     the glossy cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing CLAUDIA
     SCHIFFER's nose from one of the pages.  He returns the magazine
     to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the
     rush hour pedestrian traffic.

     Pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building, he
     glimpses the reflection of a HOMELESS MAN standing directly
     behind him.  Truman, spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels
     around to face him.  The Homeless Han is in his late-sixties.
     more well-groomed and well-fed than the average vagrant, with a
     serene smile on his face.

     From a new angle we see a two-shot of Truman and the Man on a
     television screen.  The Homeless Man places his hand ever so
     gently on Truman's cheek.  Truman makes no effort to withdraw.
     He is transfixed by the the man's eyes.  He appears to recognize
     him.

                           TRUMAN
                      (almost to himself, mouthing
                      the word)
              Daddy...

     Suddenly a distinguished OLD WOMAN walking a small dog and a
     YOUNG MALE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase, walking in
     opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the Homeless Man,
     one taking each arm.

     A bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group,
     doors already open, and before Truman can react, the Old Woman
     and the Young Executive force the Homeless Man onto the bus.
     Truman lurches after them, but he is met by the bus doors,
     closing sharply in his face.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to BUS DRIVER)
              Hey, stop!  Stop!!

     Truman thumps against the doors, but the BUS DRIVER ignores his
     cries and the bus roars away from the curb.  He starts to run
     after the bus, colliding with several PEDESTRIANS who make no
     attempt to avoid him.

     Stepping blindly into the street, he tries to hail a taxi.
     A vacant cab suddenly switches off its "FOR HIRE" light as he
     reaches it.  Truman pleads with the TAXI DRIVER through the
     closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is
     apparently oblivious to Truman's shouts.

     Frantic, Truman, dashes into a nearby parking structure and
     grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised
     parking attendant's kiosk.  Running along the rows of parked
     cars, Truman desperately presses the car security buttons
     attached to the key rings

     A car alarm chirps and Truman turns in time to see the car's
     winking sidelights.  He jumps inside a brand new BMW and guns
     the car.  The PARKING ATTENDANT, alerted by the squealing tires,
     appears from the Men's Room and attempts to wave Truman down.

                           ATTENDANT
                      (running after the car)
              Hey!

     Truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street
     without looking, causing a taxi and a postal van to take
     evasive action.

     Catching sight of the bus in the distance, Truman leans on the
     car's horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists.  He is
     only a couple of car-lengths from the bus.

                           TRUMAN
                      (reading aloud, the
                      ID number of the bus)
              Two, four, oh, six.

     Suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to
     slow for no apparent reason.  Truman looks for a way around
     but the cars crab across the street, blocking any passage,
     working together almost as if they are running interference.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting at the cars)
              Outta the way!  Outta the way!

     The bus is escaping.

     Truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car, scattering
     PEDESTRIANS.

     The same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his
     progress suddenly accelerate in unison, anticipating his move.
     By the time Truman reaches the end of the sidewalk, the cars are
     clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam.  Truman
     spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and
     disappear from view.

     Fumbling with the gear stick. he finally finds reverse but turns
     to find a hostile group of PEDESTRIANS herded tightly together
     behind the car, leaving Truman with nowhere left to go.

     The car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath
     PARKING ATTENDANT yanks Truman from the driver's seat.

                           ATTENDANT
              What the fuck are you trying to pull?!

                           TRUMAN
                      (cowering, the fight instantly
                      gone out of him)
              I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  No harm done!
              No harm done!

                           ATTENDANT
                      (feverishly inspecting the
                      fenders for dents, he finds none)
              I oughta fuck you up!

     The Attendant looks into Truman's terrified eyes.  They get
     the better of him.

                           ATTENDANT
              Get the fuck outta here.

     The Attendant shoves Truman's briefcase into his arms and
     brushes him aside.  As he departs, Truman notices that the
     traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of
     pedestrians has dissolved.


     EXT.  BUS DEPOT.  DAY.

     Row after row of parked buses.  TRUMAN and MARLON exit an
     administration office.  Instead of heading for the exit, Truman
     begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the
     number painted on the rear of each one.

                           MARLON
              What're you doing?
                      (gesturing to the office)
              The man told you there's no such bus.

                           TRUMAN
              He's lying.  Two, four, oh, six was
              definitely the number.

     Marlon stops walking.  Truman continues his inspection.  Seeing
     there is no reasoning with him, Marlon hurries to catch him up.

                           TRUMAN
              I never believed he was dead.

                           MARLON
                      (trying to be patient)
              C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find
              a body.  You know what the currents are like
              in that water.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shudders, a memory
                      flashing in his head)
              You had to see his face when that wave hit.
              He wasn't scared Marion.  It was like he
              was expecting it, waiting for it.  He
              knew it was coming.

                           MARLON
              Why would he fake it?
                      (trying to make light)
              He's not Elvis Presley.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring the joke, pondering
                      the morning's events)
              You know what was really strange about today?
              An old woman with a little dog and a
              businessman, walking in opposite directions
              on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork.
              They force him onto a bus against his will,
              a bus that doesn't normally stop outside
              my building.  And when I'm giving chase, the
              bus never makes another stop and I get the
              feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians
              are working together to make sure I never
              catch up with it.

                           MARLON
                      (sarcastic)
              Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and
              the buses and the cars?  What are you
              saying, the entire population of Lower
              Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding
              out that your father staged his death to
              pursue a life as a street person?  Oh yeah,
              that makes sense.

     Truman has no answer.  We see an aerial shot of Truman and
     Marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of
     buses, Marlon still marveling at Truman's obstinance.  They
     have come to the last bus in the final row.  Truman hangs his
     head.  The offending bus is not amongst them.  He makes towards
     the exit without comment and Marlon follows.

     Unseen by the pair, we focus on the ID number on one of the
     buses they have previously checked - "2400".  A single drip of
     black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

     TRUMAN and MARLON, drinking beer, sit in the rear doorway of
     Marion's delivery van, wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked
     behind them.

                           TRUMAN
              You think I imagined it, don't you?

                           MARLON
              I think you're missing your dad.
                      (trying to be delicate)
              The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?

     Truman is surprised Marlon remembered.  Marlon nods to the
     sidewalk.

                           MARLON
              You got sand in your cuffs.

     Truman looks down at his feet.  A small, tell-tale pile of sand
     has poured out of his tight trouser cuff.

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe you're right.  If only the old
              woman hadn't left her dog behind.

     We see a flashback in Truman's head of the earlier scene in the
     Lower Manhattan street.  It confirms that the old woman's DOG
     was abandoned on the sidewalk.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT, QUEENS.  DAY.

     TRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy.
     doilyed apartment with his older sister, RAQUEL, late forties,
     prematurely grey.  Through a doorway, the figure of his MOTHER
     is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour.  Truman and
     Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her.

                           RAQUEL
              Don't you dare go in. Truman.  I just
              got her off to sleep.

                           TRUMAN
              It was Dad. I swear.

     Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare.

                           RAQUEL
              Well, the next time he shows up. bring
              him over.  Until then, I'm not saying a
              word about this to Mom and neither are you.

                           TRUMAN
              If it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Can you
              think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?

                           RACQUEL
              I know a reason he'd want to hide from you.
              Look at how you treat us.  You live ten minutes
              away, we hardly see you from year to year and
              then you turn up with this story so insane you
              don't even believe it yourself.  Haven't you
              hurt her enough, Truman?  She already blames you.

                           TRUMAN
                      (incredulous)
              I was seven years old!

                           RAQUEL
              But you're here and he's not.  Has it really taken you
              this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm telling you he's alive!

                           RAQUEL
                      (snapping back bitterly)
              And I'm telling you he's fish food!

     Truman meets her unforgiving eyes.  Without another word, he
     walks out of the apartment.

     Truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out.
     CHRISTOF, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close
     to Truman without being detected.  Raquel's demeanor immediately
     changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears
     younger, posture more upright, almost a different person.
     Christof hugs Raquel.

                           CHRISTOF
              You did well.


     INT.  DRESSING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     A cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical
     mirrored make-up tables.  At the only occupied table, Truman's
     contrite father, KIRK, is having what's left of his homeless
     disguise cleaned from his face by a MAKE-UP ARTIST under the
     watchful eye of two DARK-SUITED BODYGUARDS.

     From a mezzanine floor out of Kirk's vision, CHRISTOF and CHLOE
     also take in the proceedings.  Behind their heads, a monitor
     shows a surveillance picture of an agitated TRUMAN sitting in
     his car, trapped in rush-hour traffic.

                           CHLOE
              We've tightened security.

     Christof nods indifferently, knowing the damage is already done.

                           CHLOE
                      (referring to Kirk)
              Why would he do this to us?

                           CHRISTOF
              Old age.  Sentiment.  You play someone's
              father all those years, you are someone's
              father...He sees the way Truman is.  He
              feels responsible.

     Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony,
     containing a state-of-the-art monitor and VCR.  Chloe follows.
     Christof plays the cued recording without comment.  We focus on
     the screen.


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.

     A younger-looking CHRISTOF sits in a motorboat in the calm
     water of Long Island Sound.  Truman's father, KIRK, twenty-seven
     years younger and a DARK HAIRED BOY, Truman's age at the time,
     acting as a stand-in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy.
     Two SCUBA DIVERS in the ocean.

                           YOUNG CHRISTOF
                      (barking instructions to Kirk)
              ...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...

     Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction.

                           YOUNG CHRISTOF
              The freak wave will strike from the
              starboard side.  Remember, you don't
              go to the diver.  The diver goes to you.

     To simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on
     the side of the dinghy to capsize it.  Kirk and the boy are
     tossed into the water.  While the boy immediately bobs to the
     surface in his life jacket, Kirk fails to surface.  After a long
     moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away.
     now wearing a spare aqualung.

                           YOUNG CHRISTOF
              ...Good!  Good!...of course, on the day you
              only surface once you're safely beyond the
              cove...Try it one more time...You okay?

     Kirk is staring at Truman's stand-in, clinging to the upturned
     boat.  Kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing
     participant in the masquerade.

     The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirk's uncertain
     face.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.

     A cluttered garage, dimly lit by a single work lamp.  TRUMAN
     looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty
     trunk under a canvas sheet.  The trunk is fastened with a
     combination lock.  He deftly dials the correct combination and
     opens the lid.

     Inside, mementoes from his youth.  A "HOW TO SAIL" book, a
     stack of "GREAT EXFLORERS" magazines, and beneath it all, a
     garment in a drycleaning bag.  Truman carefully lifts up the
     plastic to reveal a schoolgirl's lavender cardigan decorated
     with pearl beading.  He puts the cardigan to his nose and
     breathes deeply.

     Footsteps.  Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and
     shuts the lid.  MERYL, standing close behind.

                           MERYL
              What're you doing out here?

                           TRUMAN
                      (turning attention to an upturned
                      mower on the garage floor)
              Fixing the mower.

     Meryl doesn't look like she buys it.

                           MERYL
                      (concerned)
              Your sister called.  She was worried about you.

                           TRUMAN
                      (matter-of-fact)
              I saw my father on State Street dressed as
              a homeless man.

                           MERYL
                      (attempting to comfort)
              I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.

                           TRUMAN
                      (irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)
              What do you want?

                           MERYL
              I made macaroni.

                           TRUMAN
              I gotta go out.  About a replacement...
                      (hastily adding)
              ...mower blade.

     Meryl nods, not at all convinced.  After an uncomfortable
     pause, she turns and heads back to the house.


     EXT.  CAR WASH.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly
     washed Oldsmobile.  In the background is the warning sign he
     has just ignored, "CLOSE WINDOWS, LOWER AERIALS".

     Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender
     cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the
     severed aerial.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides
     with PEDESTRIANS.  As he drives, he tests his car radio.
     Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station.

                           FEMALE VOICE (from radio)
              ...west on Atlantic...he's making a right
              on Woodhaven...

     Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds
     that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio.
     Distracted, he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk.

                           MALE VOICE (from radio)
              ...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's
              on the move again, passing the Burger King...

     Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. Suddenly
     there is a piercing blast of feedback.  He looks up and, as far
     as the eye can see, every PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER
     along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right
     ear at exactly the same moment.

                           MALE VOICE
                      (from radio, in distress himself)
              ...something's wrong.  Change frequencies...

     Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without
     success.


     EXT.  DRUG STORE.  DUSK.

     Still shaken by his experience with the radio, TRUMAN exits
     a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag.  Out of the corner
     of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right
     ear with his finger.  He goes to say something to the by-stander
     but thinks better of it.


     EXT.  REDLIGHT DISTRICT, QUEENS.  NIGHT.

     HOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares.
     TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of
     the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each
     is by-passed.

     Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy,
     prostitute, VERONICA, wearing a platinum blonde wig.  She is in
     deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL.  Veronica recognizes
     the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window.

                           VERONICA
              Hey, Truman!  Where you bin?  You bin
              cheatin' on me?

     Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger
     seat.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     VERONICA knows the form.  As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb,
     she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the
     drycleaning bag on the back seat.  She drapes the cardigan
     around her shoulders.
                           VERONICA
              Bout time you got this thing cleaned.
                      (half-joking)
              Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady
              wear it.

     Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply.  Veronica
     removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it.

                           VERONICA
                      (examining the bottle)
              God, do they still make this stuff?
              What's the Sell-By Date?


     INT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  NIGHT.

     From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park.
     CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park
     grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe,
     the Unisphere.  Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a
     miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up
     picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car.

                           CHLOE
                      (into a flip-phone,
                      condescending)
              ...you see him messing with the antenna...what
              did you think would happen?..."lapse of
              concentration", is that what you call it?
              I call it amateur-hour...
                      (sarcastic)
              In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to
              do it over.

     Christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant
     with affection and even a mild amusement.

                           CHLOE
                      (as she hangs up, querying the
                      smile that plays around his lips)
              You think this is funny?

                           CHRISTOF
              The mask has slipped before.  Everything
              can be explained.

     TRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car
     unaware that they are being observed.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (adopting a more serious tone
                      as he returns his attention to Truman)
              What's dangerous is that he makes the connection
              between what happened today and the girl.

     We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge
     of the pool surrounding the great steel globe.

                           VERONICA
              Like I say, I don't normally do this.
              I gotta charge extra.

     Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills.
     Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as
     modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain.

     When she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her
     shoulder.  Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in
     her role.  She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the
     nape of his neck.  Slowly both heads drift together, but stop
     just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close.  So close
     they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight
     separating them.  Then finally their lips touch in the most
     gentle of caresses.

     They hold the kiss for another long moment and then
     simultaneously break.  As they look into each other's eyes,
     Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing
     a finger to his lips.  Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the
     cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste.

     From Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement,
     triggering a flashback in his head.


     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.

     As with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be
     playing on a television screen.  However, on this occasion it is
     also accompanied by CHRISTOF's comments from his perch in the
     tower above the park.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              He's re-created the event on and off for a
              number of years.  We've never understood what
              prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that
              matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy
              to approach her in the first place...

     A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, carrying a stack of books, spies
     LAUREN, sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender,
     beaded cardigan at her open locker.  She is entertaining two
     GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              We'd noticed them making eyes at each other
              for some weeks but never thought he'd say
              anything.  She was a year older, wrote poetry,
              way out of his league...

     Truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the
     lockers.  The three girls look up, surprised by the
     interruption.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting)
              Hi.

                           GIRLFRIEND 1
                      (to Lauren as the two girlfriends
                      abruptly depart)
              See you in class.

     Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends.

                           TRUMAN
              Lauren, right?

     Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her
     text books.

                           LAUREN
              No.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring her lack of interest)
              Look.  I was wonder--

                           LAUREN
              --I can't go out with you.

                           TRUMAN
              I haven't asked you yet.

                           LAUREN
              Well when you do, that's my answer.
                      (softening)
              I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.

                           TRUMAN
                      (summoning up courage from somewhere)
              Why, you married?

     Lauren smiles despite herself.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm not asking you to have my children,
              just a pizza.  How about Saturday?

                           LAUREN
                      (adamant)
              No.

                           TRUMAN
              Friday?

     Lauren looks around the deserted school corridor.

                           LAUREN
              Now.

                           TRUMAN
              Right now?  We got finals.

                           LAUREN
              If we don't go now, it won't happen.

     Truman hesitates.

                           LAUREN
                      (impatient, looking anxiously around)
              Well, what do you want to do?

     THE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT
     SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED.


     EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  DUSK.

     The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the
     Unisphere.  The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              We knew we were taking a risk.  She hadn't
              been properly coached, but we were torn...
              He'd summoned the courage to make the
              approach...We wanted to reward that.  Of
              course she took full advantage...

     Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding
     the steel sculpture.

                           LAUREN
              I never knew this place existed.

     They both stare down at the inviting water.  Lauren suddenly
     throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another
     thought.  She comes splashing to the surface.  Truman stares
     down, transfixed hy the shimmering water.

                           LAUREN
              Come on!  Come on!  It's wonderful!

                           TRUMAN
                      (nervous)
              I...I can't.

     Lauren suddenly stops splashing.

                           LAUREN
              That's right.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.

     She quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet.

                           TRUMAN
                      (confused)
              Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about.
              Has someone been talking to you?

     Lauren wrings out her dress.

                           LAUREN
                      (to the sky, upset)
              Get me out of here.  I don't want to
              be here.

     Lauren starts walking away.

                           TRUMAN
                      (confused, calling after her)
              What are you talking about?  Lauren!  Lauren!

     Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing
     her to face him.

                           LAUREN
                      (distraught)
              My name's not Lauren!  It's Sylvia!

     Truman looks into her eyes and believes her.

     THE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND
     RETURNS TO NORMAL.

     TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder
     of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as
     Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later.  As we
     have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great
     delicacy.  Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips
     with her finger.

                           SYLVIA
              In a minute someone's going to come and
              stop me talking to you.

                           TRUMAN
                      (looking around the deserted park)
              Who?  There's no one around.

                           SYLVIA
                      (covering his lips once again)
              You remember when you were a little boy,
              you stood up in class and said you wanted
              to be an explorer like Magellan.  And your
              teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too
              late, Truman.  There's nothing left to
              explore."  And all the other kids laughed.
              And you sat down.

                           TRUMAN
                      (incredulous)
              How do you know about that?

                           SYLVIA
              It doesn't matter.  You've forgotten about
              that boy, Truman.  You got scared.  Just
              because something happens, doesn't mean you
              can't take another chance in your life.

                           TRUMAN
              I don't understand.

                           SYLVIA
                      (looking over her shoulder nervously)
              There isn't much time.  Just listen.
              Everybody's pretending Truman.  Everybody
              but you.
                      (pointing to the
                      buildings on the horizon)
              Look at that project.  You think anybody
              lives there?  It's all for you, Truman.
              A show.  The eyes are everywhere.

                           TRUMAN
                      (protesting)
              Eyes?  Where?

                           SYLVIA
                      (frustrated, raving)
              Everywhere, disguised...Truman, they're
              going to fill your head with lies.
              You've got to make yourself deaf, you
              understand?  When you're afraid the most, it
              means you're on the right track.  Trust that
              boy.  Promise me you'll do that?

     Truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making.

     Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of
     nowhere.

                           SYLVIA
                      (scared)
              I told you, Truman!

     The car skids to a stop and a large MAN, 40ish, with a shock of
     dark hair jumps from the car.  The man yanks the frightened
     Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shocked)
              Hey!

                           MAN
                      (to Sylvia)
              Get in the car, Lauren!

     Truman jumps up.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the Man)
              Who are you?!

                           MAN
              I'm her father!

                           SYLVIA
              No he's not!  He's just saying that!
              Does he look anything like me?!

                           TRUMAN
              Shut your mouth!

     The man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles
     her into his car.  Truman rushes at the man.

                           TRUMAN
              Leave her alone!

     The man easily fends Truman off, knocking him to the ground.
     He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth.

                           MAN
                      (to Sylvia)
              I told you not to come here anymore!
                      (to Truman, who is getting
                      to his feet)
              Which one are you?

     Truman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back
     into his head.

                           SYLVIA
                      (calling out from the car)
              Don't listen to him, Truman.  Make yourself
              deaf.  Come find me.

                           MAN
                      (to Truman, getting into the car)
              Don't bother!  We're moving to Australia.
              New York's done something to her head.

     The Plymouth roars away.  Truman stares after it and then
     turns back to the cardigan left on the ground.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              Why did he say Australia?  Why couldn't he
              have said New Jersey?


     EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW.  DUSK, PRESENT DAY.

     VERONICA'S head suddenly appears back in frame beside TRUMAN.

                           VERONICA
              You want me to do it again?  I think I
              could do it better.

                           TRUMAN
                      (coming back to reality)
              No...thank you.

     Truman picks up the cardigan.  They return to the car.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     TRUMAN drives VERONICA back to her turf.  She smokes a
     cigarette, flicking ash out of the window.

                           TRUMAN
              Veronica, what do you know for sure?

                           VERONICA
              For sure?
                      (taking a long drag on her cigarette
                      as she gives the question due
                      consideration)
              The nuns at my school, they used to say,
              "The whole of life is faith."

     Truman regards his companion in a new light.  He comes to a stop
     at the corner where he picked her up.

                           VERONICA
                      (giving Truman an affectionate
                      peck on the cheek)
              On the house.


     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.

     Another televised flashback.  The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN
     stands reflectively beside Sylvia's open and vacated locker.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              We removed all physical trace of her
              but we couldn't erase the memory...

     ANOTHER SHORT BURST OF FAST-FORWARD AND THEN THE PICTURE RETURNS
     TO NORMAL SPEED.


     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.  DAY

     In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD
     TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's
     magazines.  By tearing out individual facial features - eyes.
     nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN
     in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to
     improvise a composite picture of Sylvia.

     The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not
     completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose.  He toys with
     several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one.
     He stares wistfully at the completed picture.

     ANOTHER BURST OF FAST-FORWARD


     INT.  SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DAY.

     SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN enters the front door.  His older
     sister, RAQUEL, has been awaiting his arrival.

                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)
              When he decided to go after Sylvia, we
              were forced to intervene once again...

                           TRUMAN
                      (excited)
              I've got something to tell you, Sis.

                           RAQUEL
                      (adopting a low, serious tone)
              I've got something to tell you too.

                           TRUMAN
                      (unable to contain his news)
              I'm going to Australia.

                           RAQUEL
              Mom's real sick.

     Truman's face falls.  As he enters the bedroom where his ill
     MOTHER lies gazing at the ceiling, we focus on his EXCHANGE
     STUDENT APPLICATION that he has inadvertently crushed in his
     hands.

     THE FLASHBACK SEQUENCE OVER, WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH
     THE IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT

     TRUMAN turns into his street but stops several houses short of
     his own driveway and kills the car's engine.  In the light of a
     streetlamp, Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed
     photograph of his wife, MERYL.  But he turns his wife's face
     away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame.

     Removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of SYLVIA
     we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by
     the years.  With the frame on his lap, Truman retrieves a
     handful of paper fragments from his jacket.  Noses.  He tests
     the likeness of each one in turn.  Unsatisfied that any of the
     new noses is an improvement, Truman tosses them out of his car
     window.  We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as
     Truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway.


     EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     Close up on a nose.  We pull back to reveal that the nose
     belongs to SYLVIA, seventeen years older than Truman's composite
     picture - slimmer in the face, wearing her hair shorter.
     She is standing at the water's edge on a long, deserted
     windswept beach, several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the
     high-water line.  In the background, a solitary, white
     beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene.

     Looking up into the sky, Sylvia's attention is drawn to a piece
     of paper carried on the ocean breeze.  The paper catches on the
     mast of one of the sailing dinghys.  A page from a newspaper,
     carrying a photograph of TRUMAN in the street where he
     encountered his father.  Sylvia retrieves the page.  The
     article's headline reads, "TRUMAN'S FATE IN DOUBT".

     Spying a MAN, late-thirties, kindly face, riding up to the beach
     house on an old bicycle, Sylvia secrets the page under her
     sweater.  The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on
     the sand.  Sylvia waves cheerfully back.


     INT.  BAR SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     In a quiet bar, a WAITRESS patiently explains her viewpoint to
     the BARMAN.  A PATRON on a barstool, eavesdrops.

                           WAITRESS
              She was willing to lose him if it meant he
              could find himself.
                      (registering the barman's blank look)
              Never mind.


     EXT.  TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee.  From inside
     the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar
     excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN.  Truman suddenly
     throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across
     the parking lot and into the school.


     INT.  UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area.
     It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the
     corridors empty.  He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open
     classroom doors as he goes.  They are all unoccupied.

     Finally, he stands outside the gymnasium.  The childrens'
     voices can still be heard.  Truman takes a deep breath and
     bursts through the double doors.

     The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder
     in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape
     of childrens' voices.  The recorder is attached to speakers on
     tall stands facing the ventilation ducts.  Truman stares at the
     machine in disbelief.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.  He stops at
     the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his
     ritual search but his heart is not in it.

     He starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection
     in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will
     appear at his side once again.  But no one joins him.

     However, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself
     that takes his interest.  An imposing forty-story office
     building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of
     reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a
     building Truman passes every day.

     As usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and
     exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating
     security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS.  Beyond security
     are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and
     delivery personnel to and from their floors of business.


     Truman abruptly enters the building.  He strides confidently
     past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs.

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
                      (to Truman)
              Can I help?

                           TRUMAN
                      (sneaking a glance at the
                      building directory)
              I have an appointment at, er...Diamond
              Enterprises.

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
              They went bust.

     The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block
     Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind
     and makes a dash for it.

     He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing,
     defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard.  A WOMAN
     EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman.  The cause
     of her concern becomes all too apparent.  Looking beyond the
     woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator
     car.

     The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building.
     Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that
     the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with
     no floors above the ground floor.

     The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other
     elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on
     folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary
     curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator
     cars.  Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn
     stares back, appalled.

     The Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take
     him by the arm.

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
              You gotta leave.

                           TRUMAN
                      (riveted by the equally-stunned
                      building occupants)
              What're they doing?

                           SECURITY GUARD 2
              You gotta leave.

     The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an
     Emergency Exit.

                           TRUMAN
                      (not going quietly)
              Just tell me what the hell's going on?

                           SECURITY GUARD 1
              We're re-modelling.

                           TRUMAN
              Like fuck!  What're they doing?


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

     TRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the
     street.

                           TRUMAN
              You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!

                           SECURITY GUARD 2
              Investigate what?  You're trespassing!

     Truman sees there is no point in arguing further.  His
     shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY.  A thought
     occurs to him.

     He starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another
     building at random.  An office block with a bank on the ground
     floor.  As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK
     STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him.  Is he so suspicious-looking or
     were they expecting him?

     Truman rushes to the elevators.  The lights above the doors
     show all the elevators on upper floors.  Frantic pressing
     of the elevator button gets no response.  Truman heads for the
     stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way.

                           OFFICIAL
              You can't--

                           TRUMAN
                      (anticipating his response)
              --I know.

     Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down
     the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district.  Every
     building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD
     anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED
     FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door.

     He feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS.  Is he simply drawing
     attention to himself by his behavior?  Truman wheels around,
     trying to make eye contact with passers-by.  They shy away.
     Truman stops still, his head reeling.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

     From the office window on the twelfth floor, TRUMAN can observe
     the glass building down the street.  He ponders the black,
     mirrored box.  LAWRENCE appears at his side.

                           TRUMAN
              You ever been into the AMT Building?

                           LAWRENCE
                      (following Truman's gaze)
              Not since they begun reconstruction.
                      (referring to the file
                      in Truman's hands)
              What're you doing with that?

                           TRUMAN
                      (defensive)
              I'm going to visit a site.

                           LAWRENCE
              What for?

                           TRUMAN
              Because I never do.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (placing a hand on Truman's arm)
              That's why we got adjusters.

                           TRUMAN
                      (looking at Lawrence's hand
                      on his arm)
              You got a problem with me going?

                           LAWRENCE
              I got a problem with you not doing your job,
              Burbank.  You already screwed up once this week.

                           TRUMAN
              Let me worry about that.

     Truman exits with the report.  After waiting only a matter of
     seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell.

     As soon as he disappears from sight, a grim CHRISTOF emerges
     from a nearby office, shadowed as always by CHLOE.   They
     approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates.

                           LAWRENCE
              680 West 89th.

     Christof nods.  Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call.


     INT.  INSURANCE CO. - STAIRWELL.  DAY.

     An out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of
     the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path
     with a large office desk they are attempting to transport.
     Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning
     clambers over the mahogany barrier.

                           MOVER 1
              Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!


     INT.  SUBWAY.  DAY.

     TRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other
     frustrated passengers.  He loses patience and suddenly
     turns and runs up the stairs.

     INT.  TAXI CAB.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no
     apparent reason.

                           TRUMAN
                      (impatiently to driver)
              Is there another way?  Can't you get around
              this?


     EXT.  A CHARRED APARTMENT BUILDING ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN exits his taxi and takes in the scene.  A partially
     burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering.  Truman
     checks the address on his file.  A small, serious-looking BOY
     straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the boy)
              When was the fire?

                           BOY
                      (shrug)
              Week ago.

                           TRUMAN
              How come it's still smoking?

                           BOY
              Started up again.
                      (dismissive)
              Kids.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to his claims report)
              Says here it burnt to the ground.

                           BOY
              Wishful thinking maybe?

     The boy is wise well beyond his years.  Truman fixes him with a
     glare.

                           TRUMAN
              Someone send you to tell me all this?

                           BOY
                      (unfazed)
              You the one askin' questions.

     The boy casually rides away.


     EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.

     TRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing.  We
     sense, truly observing for the first time.

     A group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball.  A YOUNG
     WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS.  An OLD MAN answers the
     incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD.  Nothing appears amiss.


     EXT.  TIMES SQUARE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned
     on Times Square.  Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of
     vehicles flowing through the intersection.

     Truman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out
     into the traffic.  However as his foot is poised, the stream
     of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to
     be giving him a wider berth.  He steps off the sidewalk and.
     to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth
     without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle
     will take evasive action.

     Safely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of
     the window of an electronics store.  He watches a local TV
     news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13.

     However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own
     face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the
     store window.  He shudders at his video reflection.


     INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN'S face stares out from a televison monitor.  We slowly
     pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the
     first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room
     the size of a football field.

     The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the
     ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile.
     Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from
     all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life.
     Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard,
     car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore
     to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the
     abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the
     locations strangely devoid of people.

     Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its
     illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.  Facing the
     desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs,
     wearing the slimmest of headsets.  SIMEON, a meticulous young
     man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the
     largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.

     CHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the
     live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe,
     continuing to inspect his surroundings.  CHLOE hovers in the
     background.

     There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the
     production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first
     time.  Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a
     microphone on the control panel.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...Everybody stay focused...remember who
              you are...


     EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move.

     A DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and
     carries them into a Restaurant Supply store.  Further down the
     street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an
     electrical repair in an exposed manhole.  A POSTAL WORKER does
     his rounds.  An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping
     bags.  Everybody appears natural, places to go.

     Truman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN
     at the only other occupied table at the cafe.  We see extreme
     close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of
     phoniness.  They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments
     to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys.
     Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine.

     Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he
     has been fidgeting.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     The on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the ring's POV, revealing
     that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden
     camera.  Truman suspects nothing.

     He looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime
     run, making their way down the street towards the cafe.  Truman
     happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers.  He
     springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring at the monitor)
              Damn!

     Unseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a
     moment of pleasure from the older man's distress.


     EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the jogger with
                      the familiar sneakers)
              Small world.

                           JOGGER 1
                      (attempting to sidestep Truman)
              Excuse me.

     Truman blocks the man a second time.

                           TRUMAN
              You don't remember?  Two days ago I gave you
              my meatball sandwich in the park.  You were
              in a wheelchair.  Same sneakers.

     An almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head
     confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the
     wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same.

                           TRUMAN
                      (commenting ironically on his
                      new-found mobility)
              A miracle!

                           JOGGER 2
                      (coming to his companion's aid)
              Get the hell outta here.

     The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table
     causing him to stumble.


     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - MARLON'S WORK.  DAY.

     MARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van.
     TRUMAN hurries up to him.

                           TRUMAN
              Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.

                           MARLON
                      (surprised)
              Truman!  Sorry, I'm up against it today.

                           TRUMAN
              I've fallen over something, Marlon.
              Something to do with my Dad. I think.

                           MARLON
                      (looking at him for the first time)
              Are you okay? You look like shit.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring the inquiries
                      about his health)
              It's big, Marlon.  You wouldn't believe
              who's in on it.

                           MARLON
                      (distracted)
              In on what?

                           TRUMAN
              There's no point trying to show you, they cover
              their tracks too well.  But I've been going
              into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta
              familiar faces, y'know what I mean?

                           MARLON
                      (still engrossed in his own problems)
              Something's definitely in the air.  My last
              delivery, a kid got crushed to death.
              tilting a vending machine.  They won't even
              let me take the rest of the day off.

                           TRUMAN
              Do it, anyway.

     Marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes Truman isn't
     joking.

                           TRUMAN
              I'm deadly serious. Marlon.  We can't talk
              here.  I'm being followed.

                           MARLON
                      (suddenly concerned)
              Who?

                           TRUMAN
              I don't know.  They look just like regular
              people.
                      (producing a notebook from
                      his jacket pocket)
              But I've been writing down numbers - license
              plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same
              ones keep cropping up over and over.

                           MARLON
              Is someone leanin' on you, Tru?  Cos I got
              some friends here, they owe me.  We can lean back.
                      (pointing out a taxi
                      parked outside the yard)
              Is he one of them?

                           TRUMAN
                      (anxious)
              I don't know.  Could be.  One thing's certain.
              The key is spontoneity.  Be unpredictable.
              They can't stand that.  That's why we've got
              to get outta here.  Can you come with me?

                           MARLON
                      (weakening)
              Christ, Truman.  You're gonna get both our
              asses fired.

     Marlon shuts his van and gets in.  Truman enters the
     passenger side.

                           MARLON
              Where're we going?

                           TRUMAN
              The beach.


     INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is in deep conversation with two executives.  MOSES, a
     contemporary of Christof but more jaded and debauched-looking
     and ROMAN, a fresh-faced, younger man.  CHLOE hovers in the
     background.  A monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a
     surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MARLON pulling into a beach
     parking lot in Marlon's van.

     The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control
     facility where SIMEON continues to call the shots, all too aware
     of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (marveling, excitedly referring
                      to Truman on the monitor)
              I can't believe how much he's shoved down.  That he
              sensed the significance at aged seven and clung
              to it so fiercely.

     Roman paces, agitated, unimpressed.  Moses, mnore respectful.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (gesturing to the clifftop on the
                      monitor pointedly excluding Roman
                      from the conversation)
              You remember, Moses, it used to end right
              there, before the expansion.

                           ROMAN
                      (unable to contain his anxiety
                      any longer)
              Christof, the cracks are starting to show.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (reassuring, keeping
                      himself in check)
              I'll paper over them.

                           CHLOE
                      (coming to the defense of her mentor)
              Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and
              recovered.

                           ROMAN
                      (adamant, faintly hysterical)
              No, not like this.  It's compromised.
              Becoming unwatchable.

     Too much for Christof.  He wheels on the young man.

                           CHRISTOF
              Fear?  Doubt?  Is that what you have
              trouble watching?  Perhaps you don't like
              watching yourself.

     Roman is stung into silence.

                           MOSES
                      (realizing his colleague is in
                      over his head, including Chloe
                      to save Roman's face)
              Why don't you two wait outside?

     Reluctantly Roman and Chloe exit and join Simeon at the video
     wall.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (instantly more comfortable in the
                      company of a man his own age)
              He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all.  We'll
              get him back on.

                           MOSES
              You know why they're so nervous.  The birth of
              Truman's child is going to double revenue.
              For God's sake don't let him upstage you.
                      (indicating Simeon through
                      the glass walls)
              You've been grooming a successor.

                           CHRISTOF
              He's not ready.

                           MOSES
              Him or you?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (jaw setting firm, referring
                      to Truman on the monitor)
              You can't pull him back in without me.
                      (more reflective)
              He's just acting out of character.

                           MOSES
              What if he's in character?  What if he's
              starting to act in character at last?  Have
              you ever considered that?


     EXT.  LONG ISLAND BEACH.  DAY.

     TRUMAN runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to
     scale as a seven-year-old boy.


     EXT.  CLIFFTOP.  DAY.

     TRUMAN sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father
     had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years
     earlier.  However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his
     father described - almost identical to its neighbor.  MARLON,
     laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop.

                           MARLON
              What're we doing here, Truman?

                           TRUMAN
              This is where it started.

                           MARLON
              Where what started?

                           TRUMAN
              Things.  Things that don't fit.  Loose threads.
              False steps.  Slips of the tongue.

                           MARLON
                      (irritated)
              Make sense, Truman.  You going religious on me?

                           TRUMAN
                      (tears of bitterness welling in his eyes)
              My father didn't want me to see what was over here.
              Whatever it was, it's gone now.  I never shoulda
              listened to him that day.  I knew it was wrong.

     We see a quick flashback of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN on the cliff-
     face twenty-seven years earlier.

                           TRUMAN
              There were a hundred people on the beach that
              day.  Everybody knew what was going on except me.

                           MARLON
              I don't want to put you down but why would
              anybody go to all this trouble over you?

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else.
                      (a memory triggered)
              A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a
              copy of Time Magazine.  The week before an ad said,
              "Next Week:  Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

     Marlon shrugs, unimpressed.

                           TRUMAN
              A guy with the same name as me in Time
              Magazine.  It ain't a common name so I
              looked out for it.  But the day it came
              out, every newstand was sold out.  No
              library had it.  I even wrote off for a
              back-issue.  Never seen a copy to this day.

     Marlon remains unconvinced.

                           TRUMAN
              Maybe I'm being set up for something.  You
              ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your
              whole life has been building to something?

     Marlon looks skeptically at Truman.  He hasn't had that feeling.

                           MARLON
                      (becoming testy)
              A coincidence.  Haven't you ever heard
              of a coincidence?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm a walking coincidence.  I can't count 'em.
              No something's happening, Marlon.  I've got
              to get to the bottom of it.

                           MARLON
                      (shaking his head in exasperation)
              Of what?!  Why're you doing this to yourself?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm scared, Marlon.  I'm as scared as hell.
              But I've never felt more alive.  It's just
              like she said.

                           MARLON
                      (suddenly intrigued)
              Who?

                           TRUMAN
              It doesn't matter.  She was too beautiful for here.

     Now Marlon is really confused.

                           TRUMAN
              Can you lend me some money?  A hundred bucks.

                           MARLON
              All I got on me is the takings from the machines.
              Why do you need it?

                           TRUMAN
              I'm going away for a while.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.

     The comfortably furnished room of a writer.  Walls lined with
     books.  Desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and
     other reference material.  Sylvia's name on the spine of several
     published volumes.  Pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten
     in blue ink.

     SYLVIA stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration.  As she
     pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor.  Truman's
     missing copy of Time Magazine.  His face on the cover with the
     headline,  "Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

     Sylvia retrieves the magazine.  In front of a nearby mirror, she
     holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment
     imagining them together.  Then, catching herself, she quickly
     lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     We see TRUMAN's disturbed face reflected in the screen of his
     television set, montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH, host of
     "Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous".  MERYL, wearing her robe,
     head against Truman's chest, sips from a bottle of beer.

                           MERYL
                      (attempting to open him up)
              What's going on, Truman?  You're not yourself.

                           TRUMAN
                      (vague)
              Maybe you just don't know me very well.


     INT.  DINING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining
     room with an elegant WOMAN, thirty years his junior.  Playing
     silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance
     shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television.

     CHLOE, enters the room and nods an apology to Christof's dinner
     companion - a woman her own age.  Christof's companion shrugs
     resignedly.  Christof registers Chloe's thinly disguised
     resentment, enjoying the rivalry.

     Chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR.  Christof
     wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as
     he gives the television his full attention.  A commercial for
     "GLOBAL TRAVEL" begins to play.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     TRUMAN continues to watch "Lifestyles" restlessly.  However, as
     he goes to get up from the sofa, MERYL starts to slide down his
     chest towards his lap.

                           MERYL
              We could do it right here, like we used to.

     The program cuts to a commercial break.  The commercial
     is for "Global Travel".

                           NARRATOR
                      (from television)
              Travelling Down Under?  Global Travel is
              turning rates to Australia upside down.  Round
              Trip to Sydney only $829.  One way, $465.
              Global Travel at Broadway and 44th...

     Truman perks up at the commercial while Meryl's attention is
     elsewhere.

                           TRUMAN
                      (abruptly getting up)
              Lemme go to the bathroom.

                           MERYL
              Don't be too long.

     Truman exits the living room.  However, on his way to the
     bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table.  He surreptitiously
     lifts the platic-coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous
     bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden.


     INT.  CHRISTOF'S BEDROOM.  DAWN.

     CHLOE pulls back long, white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular
     view overlooking the Hollywood Hills.  CHRISTOF rouses from his
     enormous round bed.  His DINNER COMPANION also stirs, waving
     coyly to Chloe as she modestly covers herself, only mildly
     perturbed by the intrusion.  Chloe switches on the television
     set in the extravagent bedroom.  Playing on the set are TRUMAN
     and MERYL still fast asleep in their own bed.

                           CHRISTOF
              What happened overnight?

                           CHLOE
              He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (smiling to himself)
              God, that thing of his must be psychic.
                      (matter-of-fact)
              He didn't masturbate?

                           CHLOE
              Not for the last two inonths.

     Chloe exits and Christof climbs out of bed.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  MORNING.

     MERYL emerges from the bathroom, ready for work, surprised to
     find TRUMAN sitting at the kitchen table.

                           MERYL
                      (rubbing ointment into her wrists)
              Aren't you gonna be late?

                           TRUMAN
              I got a call in the area.
                      (nodding to her wrists)
              What's the case?  Anything interesting?

                           MERYL
                      (dispassionate)
              Rape on the subway.

     Truman's eyes widen.  We see a quick flashback in Truman's head
     of the two YOUTHS assaulting the WOMAN on his train.

                           MERYL
              They're guilty as hell but they'll walk.  No
              witnesses.  Her word against theirs.
                      (picking up her bag to leave)
              Maybe we could meet for lunch today.

     Meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door.
     Truman waits for the sound of Meryl's car to disappear down the
     road and exits himself.


     INT.  COURT BUILDING.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN enters the courtroom building.  A crush of DEFENDENTS,
     FAMILIES, ATTORNEYS and POLICE OFFICERS.  Truman goes to enter
     a courtroom but a SECURITY GUARD blocks his path.

                           SECURITY GUARD
              You a witness?

                           TRUMAN
              Er, yes...
                      (suddenly losing heart)
              No, no I'm not.

                           SECURITY GUARD
              Closed session.

     Before the guard can move him on. Truman sneaks a look at
     proceedings through the courtroom door window.

     He recognizes the two YOUTHS sitting at the defendent's table.
     A PROSECUTOR is on his feet, addressing the JURY.  MERYL is
     working attentively at her stenotype machine, her fingers
     rapidly pressing the keys.  However, Truman notices a glaring
     omission.  There is no paper emerging from Meryl's machine.  The
     roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg.
         

     INT.  TRAVEL AGENCY.  DAY.

     The EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS inside GLOBAL TRAVEL are all doing
     a last-minute primp, fixing their hair and checking their
     clothes.  Suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and
     begin working.  As TRUMAN enters GLOBAL TRAVEL, one CUSTOMER
     looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival.

     Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a
     female TRAVEL AGENT.  Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera
     in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with
     his hand.

                           TRUMAN
              I wanna book a flight to Australia.

                           AGENT
              Where exactly?

                           TRUMAN
                      (believing she is being
                      deliberately obtuse)
              Australia.

                           AGENT
                      (a trace of condescension)
              Where in Australia?  What city?

                           TRUMAN
              Sorry, Sydney.  Sydney, Australia.  That's right.

                           AGENT
                      (entering the destination in her
                      computer)
              For how many?

                           TRUMAN
                      (finding the question suspicious)
              One.

                           AGENT
              When do you want to leave, remembering, of
              course, that you do lose a day on the way there?

                           TRUMAN
                      (more urgent than he intended)
              Today.

                           AGENT
                      (reading off her computer screen)
              I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for a
              week.

                           TRUMAN
                      (suspicious)
              A week.

                           AGENT
                      (patiently explaining)
              It's the busy season.

                           TRUMAN
                      (paranoia showing)
              You sure you're not trying to keep me here?
              You are a travel agent, aren't you?  Your
              job is to help people travel, not keep 'em
              where they are.
                      (pointing to the agent's
                      name tag, "DORIS - Travel Agent")
              Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?

                           AGENT
                      (showing amazing restraint)
              I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship
              departing for Australia tomorrow.  But you
              wouldn't want to do that.

                           TRUMAN
              Why wouldn't I?

                           AGENT
              I thought you were in a hurry.

                           TRUMAN
                      (calming down)
              That's right.

                           AGENT
              You want to book the flight?

     Truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several
     rolls of quarters from Marlon's vending machines.  The agent
     looks askance at the pile of cash.

                           TRUMAN
              You were expecting me, weren't you?

     The travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket.

                           AGENT
              It's non-refundable.


     EXT.  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF stands with a PRODUCTION MANAGER, mid-thirties, on the
     forecourt of the Sydney Opera House, its sail-like roofs soaring
     above them.  Framing the background, the coathanger-shaped
     Sydney Harbor Bridge.

                           PROD. MANAGER
                      (unable to conceal his pride)
              Happy?

     Christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring out at the pleasure
                      craft littering the harbor)
              Can we contain him long enough?

                           PROD. MANAGER
              I think so.

     Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the
     harbor.

                           PROD. MANAGER
                      (anticipating his next question)
              He flies at night.  Thick cloud cover to
              disorient him.  Hopefully we'll knock him
              out with complimentary cocktails, pull the
              shades down during the movies.  He'll never know.

     Christof gives another grudging nod of approval.  The Production
     Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are
     putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House.
     CHLOE drifts to Christof's side, a Watchman TV in her hand.

                           CHLOE
                      (referring to the surrounding scene)
              Why go to all the trouble?

     Christof glances at the TV screen in her hand, showing TRUMAN
     sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA.

                           CHRISTOF
              He believes she has the answer.

                           CHLOE
              Why not just tell him she's dead?

                           CHRISTOF
              It's too late for that.  That won't satisfy
              him.  He's going to have to find out for himself.
              See it with his own eyes.  Right now he needs
              something genuine.
                      (rueful, all too aware
                      of the contradiction)
              Even if we have to fake it.


     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.

     Close up on typewriting appearing on a page.

              "Please accept my resignation from
              American Life & Accident, Inc. to
              take effect immediately.

              Yours tru"

     TRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a
     fellow AGENT's desk.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to agent, picking up
                      a dictionary)
              "Yours truly..."  You spell "truly"
              "l...y" or "e...l...y"?

                           INSURANCE AGENT
              I always write "Yours faithfully..."

     Truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at
     the entry for a long moment.  He looks up, staring into the
     middle distance.  His eyes widen as something clicks in his
     mind.  Suddenly LAWRENCE snatches the dictionary from his hand.

                           LAWRENCE
              Where the hell have you been, Burbank?
              What the hell's going on?

                           TRUMAN
              That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.

     The AGENTS in the other cubicles turn in their direction.

                           TRUMAN
              I was just about to resign.  Isn't that
              a laugh?  I just realized there's nothing
              to resign from, is there?

                           LAWRENCE
              Listen, don't bother with the resignation.
              Just get the fuck outta here.

                           TRUMAN
                      (addressing the whole office)
              Why're you all pretending?  Huh?
                      (gesturing to a computer terminal)
              What is this a front for?  Why aren't I in
              on the joke?  Was I away that day?!

     Noting two colleagues exchanging a look, he pulls the computer
     off the desk to get their attention.  It lands on the floor with
     an expensive crash.

                           TRUMAN
                      (hysterical)
              I'm talking to you!  Who am I?!

                           LAWRENCE
                      (taken aback by the sudden violent act)
              You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.

                           TRUMAN
                      (mimicking)
              "Security!  I'm calling Security".

     Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk, containing
     SYLVIA's hidden likeness.  Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence,
     pinning him to a cubicle wall.

                           TRUMAN
              You don't believe a single word you're saying!
                      (to the assembled group)
              None of you do!
                      (suddenly talking to a sprinkler
                      head in the ceiling)
              You hear me?!

     We see Truman's manic face from the sprinkler head's POV.
     Truman stomps off down the corridor, other Insurance Agents
     giving him a wide berth.  He shoves computers, desk lamps and
     pot holders off desks as he goes.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.

     TRUMAN steps out of the office, suddenly able to breathe
     again, pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is once again standing at the picture window in the
     dimly-lit control room where we first encountered him.  Behind
     him, the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze.  The
     sky, a cloudless, cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast
     day in New York City.

     SIMEON, co-ordinating camera angles, sits in front of the
     largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of TRUMAN
     stuck in his car in gridlock.

                           SIMEON
                      (talking quietly into a
                      slim headset)
              ...and back to the close-up...

     CHLOE's attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying
     a freeze frame of TRUMAN reading the dictionary a few minutes
     earlier.

                           CHLOE
                      (to a hard-bitten Operator, staring
                      at the dictionary)
              Do you think he sees the entry?

                           OPERATOR
              Hard to tell.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (sarcastic)
              Why don't we ask him?

                           CHLOE
                      (snapping back, referring to the book)
              I don't know how it got there!
                      (to Operator)
              Enhance.

     Christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window.
     We focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionary's text.

     EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET IN QUEENS.  DAY.

     TRUMAN drives erratically down a quiet suburban street.
     On the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a YOUNG MOTHER pushing an
     INFANT in a baby carriage.

     Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front
     of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk.  He
     has the driver's door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come
     to a halt.  Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant
     from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot.

     The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds
     the crying bundle in both hands above his head.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk)
              Say my name or I'll smash its head open.

     The young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply.

                           TRUMAN
                      (vehement)
              Say my name!

                           YOUNG MOTHER
                      (composing herself,
                      reaching out for her child)
              Please, give him to me...

                           TRUMAN
                      (screaming above the baby's cries)
              Say my name!  You know my name!  Say it!

                           YOUNG MOTHER
                      (bewildered)
              I don't know you.

     The commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across
     the street, watering his garden.  He drops his hose and hurries
     towards the fracas.  Halfway across the street, the old man
     stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in
     the air.

                           TRUMAN
                      (hysterical)
              I mean it!  I'm ready to do it!
              What's my name?!!

     Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can,
     his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent
     to the concrete.  We see a view of the scene from the POV of a
     streetlight.  The young mother, recognizing Truman's
     seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes.

                           TRUMAN
                      (entreating the young
                      woman, tears in his eyes)
              This is your last chance!

     The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on
     the brink.  The young woman now has tears rolling down her
     cheeks.  She is at a loss, powerless.

                           TRUMAN
                      (his entire body shaking)
              What...is...my...name?!

     The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name.
     Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go
     through with it.  With everything he has, he gathers himself.
     After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the
     child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms.

                           YOUNG MOTHER
                      (clutching the baby to
                      her breast, without thinking)
              Thank you, Truman.

     Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the
     young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat.

     He jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the
     sidewalk and back onto the street.  The young woman and the old
     man stare after Truman's car as it roars away.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY.

     As TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous
     features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel
     insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at
     the streetlamps lining the roadway.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     A dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have
     seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon
     sun, talking animatedly.  A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the
     guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the
     television set hidden away in an antique bureau.

     SYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she
     sees playing on the screen.  The MAN on the balcony catches
     her look as she swiftly switches off the TV.  She gently takes
     the child's hand and leads him outside.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DAY.

     TRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden.
     doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches.

                           TRUMAN
                      (referring to a distant
                      car on the expressway)
              See that car way down there?  I bet it's a
              Suburu station wagon.

     Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car.
     Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by.  Meryl is unimpressed.
     Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game.

                           TRUMAN
              I predict the next four cars will be a
              white Honda Civic, a blue and white
              Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing,
              a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender
              and a motorcycle.

     Meryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for
     the house.  Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch.  He
     turns to check his prediction.  A convoy of cars approaches.

                           TRUMAN
              There's the Honda...the Dodge...here
              comes the dented Beetle...

     Meryl's attention wavers.  Truman tightens his grip.

                           TRUMAN
              Look, damn you!

     Following the VW is a school bus.

                           MERYL
                      (mocking)
              Where's the motorcycle?

     Truman is momentarily disappointed.  Meryl seizes her chance
     and heads for the house.  Truman follows her inside.

                           TRUMAN
                      (yelling after her)
              Don't you want to know how I did that?
              Maybe you already know.  Is that it?

     Behind Truman's back, a motorcycle putters by.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY.

     MERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters.

                           MERYL
              Where have you been?  I've been calling you
              all day.

                           TRUMAN
              Have you been concerned, Meryl?  Nice name.
              "Meryl".  I always liked it.

                           MERYL
                      (matching his sarcasm)
              Nice of you to say so after eight years.

                           TRUMAN
              Actress's name, isn't it?  What's your
              real name?

                           MERYL
                      (rolling her eyes)
              Oh, God.  What's got into you?

                           TRUMAN
              Take a break. Meryl
                      (a knowing, almost foolish grin)
              I know.

                           MERYL
              I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.
              I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me...

                           TRUMAN
                      (irritated)
              Drop it, I said.  It's over.

                           MERYL
                      (rambling on)
              ...we need more charcoal.

                           TRUMAN
              Shut up!

                           MERYL
              I'm gonna take a shower.

                           TRUMAN
                      (catching her wrist)
              No.  We're going for a drive.

                           MERYL
              What?!

     Despite her protests, Truman drags Meryl out the back door
     and towards his car.

                           TRUMAN
                      (as he shoves her into
                      the Oldsmobile)
              For years I've been saying I want to go
              some place, well now I'm ready to go.  Let's
              just jump in the car and go.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY.

     TRUMAN holds MERYL's wrist to stop her exiting the car and
     accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking.

                           TRUMAN
                      (as they speed down the suburban street)
              I thought maybe, Atlantic City.

                           MERYL
                      (trying to mask her anxiety)
              You hate gambling.

                           TRUMAN
              That's right.  I do, don't I?

                           MERYL
              So why do you wanna go?

                           TRUMAN
              Cos I never have.  That's why you go places,
              isn't it?  Cos you're curious.  I haven't
              been curious since I was seven years old,
              y'know that?  Back then you'd have to nail me
              to the floor to keep me in one place.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     All eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track
     Truman's speeding car.

                           CHRISTOF
              How long to take Atlantic City out of
              mothballs?

                           SIMEON
              We could be up and running...three hours maybe.

                           CHRISTOF
              Give me a number five gridlock on the
              Jersey Turnpike.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New
     Jersey Turnpike.  We observe the Oldsmobile on a television
     lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead.

                           TRUMAN
                      (a manic edge to his voice)
              So much traffic, this time of day.  Does
              that strike you as peculiar?

     On the side of the road, TWO MOTORISTS, are arguing over a
     minor collision.

                           TRUMAN
                      (sneering at the sight of
                      the motorists)
              Look at them.  You believe they're
              fighting?  I don't believe it.
                      (shouting out the window
                      to the motorists)
              Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic?

     Without warning, Truman suddenly exits the freeway.  But
     his move is anticipated.  At the end of the offramp a pack of
     cars suddenly appears.  Other vehicles fill the gap behind.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to Meryl, marveling)
              Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully
              synchronized, don't you agree?

                           MERYL
                      (incredulous)
              You blaming me for the traffic?

                           TRUMAN
              Should I?

                           MERYL
              You've never been on this road before.
              You don't know what it's like.

                           TRUMAN
                      (manic)
              That's true.  We could be stuck here
              for hours.  Could be like this all the
              way to Atlantic City.

     Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk.

                           MERYL
              What the hell are you doing?

                           TRUMAN
              You're right.  Let's go back.  I'm
              sorry.  I don't know what got into me.

     Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards
     Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic.

                           MERYL
              Would you please slow down, Truman?

     Truman floors the Oldsmobile.  The car flies past the exit for
     Route 276.  He continues along the Jersey Turnpike.

                           MERYL
              Truman, that was the turnoff!

                           TRUMAN
              I've changed my mind again.  What's Maine
              like this time of year?! I've never been to
              Maine.
                      (Truman looks up through the
                      windshield at a helicopter
                      tracking his progress)
              Or let's just see where the road takes us.

                           MERYL
                      (pleading)
              Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.
              You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!

                           TRUMAN
                      (eerily calm)
              I think I'd like a little company.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Truman's
     progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically
     circled to ease identification.  Christof jabs his finger at the
     rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (to Simeon)
              What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"?
              Keep them together.

                           SIMEON
                      (agitated)
              They're rusty.  We can't keep up.
                      (rueful aside)
              We don't know where he's going any more.

                           CHLOE
              Oncoming is very thin.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.

     As he speeds erratically, TRUMAN glances at the streets either
     side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of
     moving traffic.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the anxious Meryl at his side)
              Look down there, Meryl!...No cars!  I don't
              run into traffic.  The traffic follows me around.
                      (excited by his discovery)
              We're in a moving pack, don't you see?

     Truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (enthusing)
              He's so close!  It's tantilizing!

                           CHLOE
              You want to pull him over?

                           CHRISTOF
              No police.  Not yet.  We shadow him.
              We don't want him to panic.

                           CHLOE
              He's trying to outrun the traffic.

                           CHRISTOF
              He's trying to outrun the world.  Keep him
              on this route.
                      (to Simeon who is consulting
                      someone on his headset)
              Are we ready?

     Simeon nods.  Executives, MOSES and ROMAN have entered the
     control room.  They hover nervously in the background.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR, WESTCHESTER.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars
     at a police roadblock.  At the head of the line, the cars are
     being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS, who are also contending
     with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to Meryl)
              It's hard to go places, isn't it?

                           MERYL
              There's been an accident, Truman.  We
              have to go back.

                           TRUMAN
              No.  There's no accident.  It'S just more stalling.

     Truman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER.

                           TRUMAN
              What's going on?

                           OFFICER
                      (grim-faced, indicating the nearby
                      Indian Point nuclear power plant)
              Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.

                           TRUMAN
              Is there any way around?

                           OFFICER
              The whole area's being evacuated.  A precaution.

     Truman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when, all
     of a sudden, he guns his car and swerves past the barricade.


     EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.

     In the twilight sun, SYLVIA'S GUESTS wander up the gravel path,
     leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried
     in their parents' arms.  Hanging back from the rest of the
     group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back
     to the house.  As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against
     the side of the beach house, he looks in a window.

     Lit by a blue-glow, SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television
     playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our
     view.  She is unaware of the man's face at the window.

     Recognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards
     Sylvia with a resigned smile.  He mounts the bicycle and rides
     back up the path.


     EXT.  NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  DUSK.

     Truman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste
     vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant,
     the pursuing police car blocking his retreat.  TRUMAN flees the
     car, leaving MERYL in the passenger seat.

                           MERYL
              Truman!!  Come back!!

     Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in
     their protective suits carrying detection instruments.  The
     workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off
     his path to the power plant.  As he crests a slight rise beyond
     the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground.  However,
     peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the
     lights of a cityscape in the distance.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to CHLOE.

                           CHRISTOF
              Did he see it?

                           CHLOE
              I don't think so.

     The reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as
     the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling
     TRUMAN is being escorted away.  We see an aerial shot from the
     helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     MERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table.  Truman stoic,
     tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks.  Truman's airline ticket
     torn to shreds on the table in front of them.

                           MERYL
              Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're
              not well.

                           TRUMAN
                      (ignoring her tears and medical advice)
              Why do you want to have a child with me?
              You can't stand me.

                           MERYL
              That's not true.

                           TRUMAN
                      (suddenly angry)
              Don't lie to me!

     Truman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet.  Truman follows,
     getting in her face.

                           TRUMAN
              Tell me what's happening?!

                           MERYL
                      (frightened but remaining poised)
              I thought you knew everything.  What could
              I tell you?

                           TRUMAN
                      (backing her up against
                      the kitchen bench)
              You're part of this, aren't you?!

     Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect
     herself.

                           MERYL
              Truman, you're scaring me!

     Truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness,
     grabs her wrist and disarms her.

                           TRUMAN
              No, you're scaring me, Meryl!

     Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her.
     While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to
     march her around the room, talking to the walls, light
     fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television.

                           TRUMAN
              Stop this now or I kill your leading lady.
                      (to a lamp)
              I know you can hear me.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN
     looks directly into one camera lens after another.  ROMAN is the
     first to crack.

                           ROMAN
                      (entreating Christof)
              Get somebody in there!

                           CHRISTOF
                      (quiet but firm)
              No.

                           SIMEON
                      (siding with the executive,
                      showing his true colors)
              She's in trouble!  We've got to help her!

     Christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into
     the microphone.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     We see an extreme close up of MERYL's ear.  Unheard by TRUMAN,
     from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              He's bluffing.  Call his bluff.

                           MERYL
                      (in reply to the voice in her
                      head, half-strangled due to the
                      pressure of the knife)
              Do something...

     Upon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen.  Sensing that she
     too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to
     read her face.

                           TRUMAN
                      (wild-eyed)
              Who are you talking to?!

                           MERYL
                      (incredulous)
              You're the one talking to the walls!

                           TRUMAN
              No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you
              talking to?  I swear I'll kill you, if
              you don't tell me.

     Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to
     the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman
     forces his way inside.  They both tumble onto the waterbed
     causing it to rock back and forth.  Gripping Meryl's hair,
     Truman throws aside the bed covers.

                           TRUMAN
                      (distraught, referring to the bed)
              How could you buy this damn thing when you
              know he drowned in front of me?!

     Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl
     begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash.

                           TRUMAN
              You have any idea what it's like to drown?

     Truman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping
     hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water.  She
     thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself.

     Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water.

                           MERYL
                      (gasping for air)
              Truman, stop it!
                      (to the ceiling)
              Don't let him do it!

                           TRUMAN
                      (to a light fixture, threatening)
              I'll kill her!

     He dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her
     head down longer this time.  She continues to struggle.

     Suddenly, the front door chimes.  Startled, Truman lets Meryl up
     for air.

                           TRUMAN
                      (sneering at Meryl)
              Right on time.  Cops must be telepathic.

     Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats
     her to it.  Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand.

                           TRUMAN
                      (wincing in pain)
              Damn!

     At knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the
     front door.  The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more
     insistently.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting through the closed door)
              Stay where you are or I'll kill her!

                           MARLON (O.C.)
              Truman?  It's me, Marlon.

     Truman flinches.  He was so convinced it would be the police.
     He takes a step back against the hallway wall.  Before he can
     decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door
     to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to
     Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound.

     Marlon locks eyes on Truman.  Sizing up the situation, he slowly
     but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand.  Meryl
     wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and
     collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing.

                           MERYL
                      (distraught, dropping character,
                      forgetting herself)
              They were going to let him kill me!


     EXT.  ABANDONED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.

     MARLON and TRUMAN, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end
     of their abandoned freeway off-ramp.

                           TRUMAN
              People know who I am, my every move, complete
              strangers know my name.  Even when there's
              no one around, I feel the eyes on me.

                           MARLON
                      (reluctant admission)
              I was in the bank today.  The Federal on
              Lewis.  A clerk was talking about somebody
              named Truman messing with her baby.  Is that
              the stranger you're talking about?

     Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation.

                           TRUMAN
                      (half to himself, refusing to accept it)
              No.  No.  I've never seen her before.
                      (registering Marlon's skepticism)
              I know you already think I'm going out
              of my mind but I genuinely believe the
              world revolves around me somehow.  Everybody
              seems to be in on it.

                           MARLON
              It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure
              that's not wishful thinking, you wishing
              you'd made something more of yourself?  Christ,
              Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had
              an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters?
              Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?

                           TRUMAN
              That's just it.  I think I am somebody.

                           MARLON
                      (sympathetizing)
              I used to dream all my friends and family
              got together in a hotel room, thinking of
              ways to fuck me up.

                           TRUMAN
              Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes
              I think it's for real.

     Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere
     in the night.

                           MARLON
              Tru, we've known each other since before
              we could get a hard-on.

     Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark.

                           MARLON
              The only way we ever made it through
              high school was cheating off each other's
              test papers.  Jesus, they were identical.
              I always liked that, because whatever the
              answer was, we was right together and we
              was wrong together.

     Truman nods fondly at the memory.

                           MARLON
              The only night either of us ever spent
              in jail, we spent together and I wet
              myself but you never told anyone.
              I was best man at your wedding and my
              brother was best man at my wedding and
              you didn't talk to me for a month over
              that and I didn't blame you because you've
              been more of a brother to me than he's
              ever been.  And I never shoulda let
              my Goddam father talk me into that.

     Truman is slowly coming around.  Marlon's speech from the heart
     soothing away his pain.

                           MARLON
              I know things haven't worked out for
              either of us like we used to sit up on
              Freemont Street all night and dream they
              would.  We all let opportunities pass us
              by, none of us asks for the dance as
              often as we should.  I know that feeling
              when it's like everything's slipping away
              and you don't want to believe it so you
              look for answers someplace else.  But,
              well, the point is, I would gladly step
              in front of traffic for you.

     Truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back.  We see
     a close up of Marlon's ear.  From inside, unheard by Truman,
     CHRISTOF dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF leans over a microphone at the mixing desk, feeding the
     lines to Marlon, immersed in the role.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (hushed tones)
              ...and the last thing I'd ever do is
              lie to you...

     Recognizing the importance of the moment, his colleagues stand
     around in awe at Christof's spontaneous performance, arguably
     superior to Marlon's own delivery.

                           MARLON
                      (staring into Truman's
                      eyes, repeating the
                      words in his ear)
              And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.
                      (pause)
              Think about it, Truman, if everybody's
              in on it, I'd have to be in on it too.
              I'm not in on it cos there is no it.

     Truman's head slowly drops in surrender, his doubts draining
     away.  Marlon embraces Truman in a bearhug.

     Truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star
     shines.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     From his chair, CHRISTOF modestly accepts the congratulations of
     his COLLEAGUES.  The two executives, MOSES and ROMAN are at the
     head of the line, their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten.

     CHLOE gives Christof a warm hug.

     MARLON, accepting a towel from a P.A., still in wardrobe,
     approaches and kneels beside the arm of Christof's chair.
     grasping his hand.

                           MARLON
                      (leaving his head close to
                      Christof)
              I can't thank you enough.  I don't know
              what happened.  He was so close.  It threw
              me.  I'm indebted.

     Christof gives Marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and
     Marlon withdraws.

     Finally Christof's Assistant Director, SIMEON, approaches and
     offers his hand.  Christof hesitates before shaking.  Simeon
     returns to the monitors, now showing TRUMAN alone at the dock or
     Long Island.  Christof stares out the window to conceal an
     expression of quiet vindication.


     INT.  A LTVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.

     The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before sit on their sofa
     gazing straight ahead.  On the teievision in front of them,
     a live picture of TRUMAN - the first time we have seen him
     broadcast to a viewer's set.

     He is reading a book at his kitchen table, unaware of the
     cameras recording him.

     The scene alternates between a wide master shot, a medium tight
     shot, a close up of Truman's face and two insert shots - one
     over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from
     another angle showing the book's title, "To The Ends Of The
     Earth - The Age Of Exploration".

     At one point, a sponsor's border appears on screen, tastefully
     framing the "action" with the message, "FOLGERS Coffee - Good To
     The Last Drop."  After several seconds, the border disappears.

     Suddenly tbe live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on the
     screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around
     the edge of the image.  Overlapping scenes from Truman's life
     appear in chronological order, from infancy to adolescence and
     finally adulthood.  A graphic, "TRUMAN - Total Record Of A Human
     Life", appears on screen accompanied by an introductory
     narration.

                           NARRATOR (O.C.)
              You are watching "Truman - Total Record Of
              A Human Life".  Everything that occurs here
              is real.  There are no re-creations or
              interruptions.  Due to the live and unedited
              nature of the program, viewer discretion is
              advised.

     The title sequence is replaced by an INTERVIEWER, mid-fifties,
     conservative suit and hair, sitting opposite CHRISTOF in a Larry
     King-style interview setting.  Projected in the background is
     the live picture of Truman, immersed in his book.


     INT.  STUDIO.  NIGHT.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (to camera)
              Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty
              eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have
              been a more momentous week in the show's
              history.  I'm your host, Michael Conners, and
              this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the
              forum where we discuss and analyze recent
              events with the show's award-winning creator
              and producer, Christof.
                      (referring to the image
                      of Truman in the background)
              I remind viewers that as this is a living
              history, it is our practise to keep the image
              of Truman on screen at all times.
                      (turning to Christof)
              Welcome.

                           CHRISTOF
              Thank you.

                           INTERVIEWER
              Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in
              ratings over the last few days, how do you hope
              to sustain that audience now that Truman appears
              to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?

                           CHRISTOF
              Ratings have never been our primary goal.  I
              imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested
              in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However
              I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.

                           INTERVIEWER
              But recent events have been so dramatic, it does
              raise the perennial question.  What keeps us
              watching one man twenty-four hours a day -
              eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in
              contemplation?

                           CHRISTOF
              It has to be the reality.

     During this segment, we cut to a cross-section of VIEWERS -
     the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the two OLD WOMEN on their sofa, the
     BARMAN and the WAITRESS - listening to Christof's theories on
     their viewing habits.

                           CHRISTOF
              We've become increasingly frustrated watching
              actors give us phony emotions, bored with
              pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the
              world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's
              nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts.
              no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but
              it's genuine.  That's how he can support an
              entire channel.

                           INTERVIEWER
              A window onto the human condition?

                           CHRISTOF
              I prefer to think of it as a mirror.  Not only
              does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he
              gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

                           INTERVIEWER
              But how do you account for the popularity of
              those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

                           CHRISTOF
              We find many viewers leave him on all night
              for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your
              child or your lover sleep?

                           INTERVIEWER
              Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

     The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his
     desk's high-tech phone terminal.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (into speaker phone)
              Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.

                           MALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
              Hello?

                           INTERVIEWER
              You're on, caller.  Go ahead.

                           MALE CALLER 1
              Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you.

                           CHRISTOF
              Thank you.

                           MALE CALLER 1
              Truman has never been closer.  The way he looked
              directly at us, spoke to us for the first time.
              Do you think he'll ever work it out?

                           CHRISTOF
              I don't believe so.  Not now.  He tested his
              world, as we all do at certain times, and
              eventually it passed the test.  You have to
              understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world
              he occupies his only frame of reference.
              No, for him to come even this close to the
              truth is a remarkable testament to his
              instincts.

     The Interviewer presses another line on his terminal.

                           INTERVIEWER
              Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk".

                           MALE CALLER 2 (O.C.)
              How much of a strain has the last few days
              placed on the actors?

                           CHRISTOF
              Working on "Truman" has always been a huge
              commitment for an actor, not just in terms
              of separation from friends and family, but
              since Truman essentially drives the plot,
              it's a never-ending improvisation.  Recent
              events have raised the pressure but also the
              prestige.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (cutting off the call)
              Of course Truman has always been very much in on
              casting.

                           CHRISTOF
              As with our own lives, the only people he can't
              cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final
              approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead
              role as was the case with his only real friend,
              Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit
              player.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (pressing another line)
              Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned
              videographer, Christof.

                           MALE CALLER 3 (O.C.)
              Christof.  I've admired your work my whole life,
              although I can't say I've seen it all.

                           CHRISTOF
              Who can?

                           MALE CALLER 3
              Can you settle an argument for me?  What's
              the longest time Truman has been off-camera?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (trace of pride)
              In his entire life, forty-two minutes.  A
              technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of
              that time.  The remainder generally results
              from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman
              would stray out of range of our cameras.

                           INTERVIEWER
              The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.
                      (pressing another line)
              Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk".

                           FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
              How can you say Truman lives a life like any other?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (sensing the thinly disguised
                      resentinent in the caller's voice)
              I believe that to be so.  I often feel the only
              difference between Truman's life and our own
              is that his is being more thoroughly documented.
              We all play our allotted roles--

                           FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)
              --He's not a performer.  He's a prisoner.

     The Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof
     holds him back.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (rising to the challenge)
              --He can leave at any time.  If his was more
              than just a vague ambition, if he were
              absolutely determined to discover the truth,
              there's no way we could prevent him.  I think
              what really distresses you, caller, is that
              ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell"--

                           FEMALE CALLER 1
                      (as if trying to convince herself.
                      giving herself away)
              --No, you're wrong!  He'll prove you wrong!
              He can still do it!

                           CHRISTOF
                      (a thought occurring, looking
                      directly into camera)
              Do I know you, caller?  Your voice sounds familiar.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     SYLVIA, finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off
     the call, stares at CHRISTOF on her television screen.

     It is she who is the Female Caller.  Christof seems to stare
     back at her as the talk show continues.

                           INTERVIEWER
                      (from television)
              Recording a human life from birth to death,
              that's still the intention?  You still believe
              Truman has more to contribute?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (still reflecting on the last call)
              More than ever.  By unwittingly allowing us to
              witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing
              us to evaluate our own lives.  He gives us hope.

                           INTERVIEWER
              Let's take another call.
                      (pressing a line)
              London, England you're on "Tru Talk".

                           FEMALE CALLER 2
              By definition Truman has to be free of censorship,
              but has the recent violence and profanity
              caused a problem for the sponsors...?

     Sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on
     the window that displays TRUMAN, still buried in his book.

     She comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy.  She
     has a camera and a white envelope in her hand.  With a look of
     resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes Truman's name
     on the envelope in her familiar blue ink.


     INT.  MASTER TAPE ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire,
     cavernous room - "Truman" and a date on the spine of each
     cassette.  Suspended from the ceiling, a monitor shows a live
     picture of TRUMAN sleeping on the sofa.

     Sitting in front of a playback monitor, CHLOE is transfixed by
     Truman thirty-four years earlier, a FETUS in his mother's womb.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              What are you looking for?

     Chloe tries to conceal her startlement at CHRISTOF's unexpected
     entrance.

                           CHLOE
                      (not taking her eyes from screen)
              He was premature, wasn't he?

                           CHRISTOF
              Only by two weeks.

                           CHLOE
              Curious even then?  Like he couldn't
              wait to get started?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (feeling out where the
                      conversation is headed)
              His eagerness to leave his mother's womb
              also meant he was the one selected.

                           CHLOE
              What was it like, the first show?

                           CHRISTOF
              The ultimate live television.  In competition
              with five other unwanted pregnancies - the
              casting of a show determined by an air date
              - he was the one who arrived on cue.

                           CHLOE
              Is it true what you said...on the show tonight?
              About letting him go if he wanted it badly
              enough.  Would you really do that?

     Christof stares at his assistant, weighing her loyalty.

                           CHRISTOF
              It won't come to that.


     INT.  OFFICE.  DAY.

     The suitably crestfallen TRUMAN stands in front of his boss,
     ERROL, sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk.  LAWRENCE
     lounges on the guest sofa, enjoying Truman's dressing-down.


     INT.  BANK.  DAY.

     TRUMAN approaches the bank window.  The teller is the YOUNG
     WOMAN whose child Truman attacked in the street.  She takes a
     step back at the sight of Truman, apprehensive, the
     confrontation fresh in her memory.

     Truman glances at the names on the checks in the young woman's
     hand, realizing how she was able to identify him in the street.
     He begins to apologize profusely.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN enters the garage, carrying Sylvia's sweater.  He
     breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it
     in the trunk.  With a sense of finality, he lowers the lid and
     fastens the lock.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN emerges from the garage, wheeling his lawnmower,
     deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house.

     Staring out of the kitchen window, a tall glass of iced tea in
     her hand, MERYL has been anticipating her husband's appearance.
     She wears a neckbrace, we sense more as a reminder to Truman
     than for any benefit she might derive.

     Feeling Meryl's eyes burning into his back, Truman fires up the
     mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section
     of grass.  We focus on the errant blades of grass as they are
     severed by the mower.  The lawn is now uniformly trimmed.

     From a mechanical platform above the Expressway, CHRISTOF and
     CHLOE watch Truman's final act of defiance laid to rest.


     INT.  OFFICE BUILDING, LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

     In an office building high above Manhattan's financial district,
     a ROBOTIC MANNEOUIN in a 3-piece suit stands at an upper-story
     window mechanically lifting a coffee cup to its mouth.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.

     In the street below, something is different about the rush-hour
     traffic.  The PEDESTRIANS are all standing around, no one
     walking.  Some are chatting with each other, others primping.
     The cars, vans and taxis are also idling.

     Camera locations are being checked.  A miniature camera
     inserted into the head of a streetlamp, a CAMERA TECHNICIAN
     waves his hand in front of an innocent-looking fire hydrant, the
     eye of a MDDEL on a bus shelter's cosmetic ad is wiped clean,
     the head of a parking meter is replaced, a buttonhole camera is
     placed on a BUSINESSMAN's double-breasted jacket by a TECHNICIAN
     - we see from the button's POV, a CONTACT LENS CAMERA is
     carefully inserted into the eye of Truman's colleague, LAWRENCE,
     another TECHNICIAN we observe from the contact's POV.

     Finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building
     and a TOURIST'S camcorder are positioned.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is seated at the control desk, directing the morning
     session, SIMEON assisting, CHLOE at his shoulder, a buzz of
     excitement in the room.

                           CHRISTOF
              I hope we've got fresh extras.

                           CHLOE
                      (consulting a clipboard)
              The rotation was made this morning.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring at a monitor, irritated)
              I don't like the couple with the baby.
              They'd never be together.

     The COUPLE with the stroller are promptly moved further along
     the street.

                           CHRISTOF
              Who's doing wardrobe?  I keep seeing the
              same wardrobe...


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  MORNING.

     TRUMAN spills out of the subway car with hundreds of other
     COMMUTERS.  We hear Christof's off-camera voice, as always
     unheard by Truman.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              ...everybody back to One...

     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              ...and, action background...

     At the command, the PEDESTRIANS and VEHICLES begin inoving
     normally, TRUMAN exits the subway, suspecting nothing.  He
     begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour
     traffic.

                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)
              ...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog...
              let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept
              together...everybody look like you've got places
              to go...


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF covers his microphone to deliver an aside to SIMEON,
     from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director.

                           CHRISTOF
              I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.

     As predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's
     banner headline, "NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED".  Christof scans
     the shot options available to him on the video wall.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...Bodycam Two...

     The large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view
     of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.  For an instant, the unaware
     Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...streetlight eight...

     The monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp.  The
     camera continues to follow Truman's progress.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...ready, Car-Cam One.  Go to One...

     TRUMAN enters his office building as a taxi cruises by.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...and cut to interior...

     Truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside
     the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an
     ancient SECURITY GUARD.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...looser...

     The camera widens the angle.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...and action, Vivien...
                      (aside, proud of his casting)
              Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.

     VIVIEN, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at
     the same time as Truman.  However she reaches for it after
     Truman has already turned his back.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (incensed)
              Damn, she missed her mark!
                      (impatiently to Simeon)
              Why do we bother with walk-throughs if
              nobody pays attention?  Give me a two-shot
              of Truman and Vivien...go to the master
              ...hold the elevators...
                      (mustering patience, into microphone)
              Vivien, press the elevator button again
              ...and make sure you catch his eye this time...


     INT.  INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY.  DAY.

     A second time, TRUMAN's brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like
     clockwork.  As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator
     button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman.  The elevator
     car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she
     sachets into the lift.  For a moment he appears to glance at a
     piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           CHRISTOF
              Good!  Perfect!  Cut to the interior...

     The monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly
     filling with co-workers.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...and Lawrence...

     Just as the doors are about to close, LAWRENCE oozes in.  He
     gives Truman a smug smile.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...

     The elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers.

                           LAWRENCE
                      (admiring aside to the remaining
                      fellow-males in the elevator)
              I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

     Truman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the
     comely young woman.  He is miles away.


     INT.  STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.

     Assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are
     several principal characters in Truman's life - MERYL, MARLON,
     ERROL, TYRONE, RAQUEL, VERONICA and the new actress, VIVIEN,
     sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast.

     CHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table, a large
     monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at
     American Life plays silently behind Christof's head.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (to the meeting, referring to
                      Meryl by her real name)
              Regrettably, I have to inform you that
              Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.

     All eyes turn to Meryl.  She looks at the floor.

                           CHRISTOF
              I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.

     Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co-
     star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit.

                           CHRISTOF
              Her separation from Truman will be
              orchestrated over the summer.
                      (more up-beat)
              However, I'm pleased to announce that
              television's first on-air conception will
              still take place.  You witnessed the initial
              contact this morning.
                      (glancing to Vivien, once
                      again using her real name)
              You all know Claudia from her work in theatre.
              Thankfully, Truman doesn't.

     The rest of the cast nod politely in Vivien's direction.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (referring to the bound documents
                      CHLOE passes to each cast member)
              This is a copy of Claudia's back story.
              Her character's name will be Vivien.
              She's the new adjuster at the office.

     The cast idly flip through the documents, prominently stamped on
     the cover, "NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET".

                           CHRISTOF
              We intend to entice Truman into the
              affair as soon as possible.  Claudia will
              make her advance at the seminar Truman's
              attending next week.  Details are in your
              schedules.  I'm sure you'll all make Claudia
              welcome.

                           MARLON
                      (injecting a note of levity, more
                      sophisticated than the character he plays)
              Question is, will Truman make her welcome?

     The cast snickers.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (immediately back to business)
              I don't have to tell you, how critical
              the next few weeks will be.  This takes us
              into the next generation.  When Truman's
              child is born, the network will be switching
              to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.

                           VIVIEN
              What happens when Truman and the baby are
              both on camera together?

                           CHRISTOF
              There will simply be duplicate coverage.

                           VIVIEN
                      (mischievous)
              Let's just hope we don't have twins.

                           CHLOE
                      (uncharacteristically flippant)
              When Truman dies do we go back to the
              single channel?

     The cast turn in her direction.  Christof has a second occasion
     to question his Assistant's loyalty.


     INT.  A BAR SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     The BARMAN, WAITRESS and PATRON we have seen before, observe
     TRUMAN on the television above the bar.  The cameras track
     Truman's progress, walking along Broadway.  As he ducks into a
     sex shop, the threesome at the bar exchange looks.  Inside the
     store, Truman appears apprehensive.

                           BARMAN
              What's he doing in there?

                           PATRON
              Meryl's at her mom's.  Maybe he's got an urge.

     On screen, Truman looks through some X-Rated video titles.

                           WAITRESS
                      (referring to Truman's overcoat)
              What's with the coat?

                           BARMAN
                      (smirking at the irony)
              Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized.

     Truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia, knocking an
     item to the floor.

                           PATRON
                      (remarking on Truman's clumsiness)
              Nervous.

     Truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store,
     the cameras following his journey as always.

                           BARMAN
                      (exasperated)
              Oh God, he never bought nothing.

                           WOMAN
              Give him a break.  It's taken him thirty-
              four years to get the nerve to go in there.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT

     We focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator, several
     pages long.  The kitchen itself is a bombsite.  More than the
     cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked
     haphazardly on the floor.


     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     The usually orderly bedroom is also a mess.  Blankets piled in a
     heap.  Several large, half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the
     room.  A chair in an odd position near the bed.  Clothes strewn
     everywhere.  Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered.

     TRUMAN is asleep in bed, the damaged waterbed replaced with a
     standard mattress.  Although he is completely covered from head
     to toe in bedding, the outline of his body is still clearly
     visible.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Close up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control
     room.  It displays a wide shot of Truman's darkened bedroom
     filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras.
     Assistant Producer, SIMEON, and his VIDEO OPERATORS slouch in
     their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen.
     Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner.

                           SIMEON
              ...Ready two.  Go to two.

     Operator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated
     buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close
     shot of Truman's covered head.  The camera stays on the
     blanketed head for a long moment.

                           SIMEON
              And back to the medium.

     Another button is pressed and the angle changes.  A trace of
     frustration is evident in the control room.  Recording a
     sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to
     contend with Truman's recently aquired camera-shyness.

                           SIMEON
              ...and wide...

                           OPERATOR
                      (aside to Simeon)
              Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?

                           SIMEON
                      (shrugs)
              That loser pays our salary.

                           OPERATOR
              He's given up on himself again.

                           SIMEON
              Who cares?  Makes life easier for us.
              He is what he is.

     At the far end of the great room, one of the large double
     doors opens and CHRISTOF enters, as always accompanied by CHLOE,
     carrying a leather-bound folder.  Simeon and the Operators
     subtely straighten in their chairs.  Christof pretends not to
     notice.  He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor.

                           CHRISTOF
              When did he start sleeping like that?

                           SIMEON
              About the time Meryl left.

                           CHRISTOF
              Is that the best shot we can get?

                           SIMEON
              What's to see?

     Christof watches Truman, a trace of concern in his eyes.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom)
              What happened to the room?

                           SIMEON
              He started to reorganize.  I was going to
              call you.  But half-way through, he gave
              up and fell asleep.

     Apparently satisfied, Christof turns to an operator.

                           CHRISTOF
              I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's
              insurance convention.

     Reading off the notes in Chloe's folder, the operator punches
     up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors.  They
     show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel, devoid of actors.  A
     banner in reception reads, "WELCOME AMERICAN LIFE & ACCIDENT".
     The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his
     producer's attention has wandered.  Christof is staring at the
     sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor.

                           CHRISTOF
              Give me a shot from his wedding band.

                           SIMEON
                      (pointing out the ring on Truman's
                      bedside table)
              He took it off.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (a trace of concern)
              Why is he so still?  He's too still.

     Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to
     his ear.

                           CHRISTOF
              Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.

     An operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel.  Christof and
     his colleagues listen to Truman's steady breathing in their
     headphones.  Simeon and the Operators nod, reassured that
     nothing is amiss.  Christof is not so easily convinced.

                           CHRISTOF
              Give me a preview.  An ECU on his torso.

     A camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to Truman's
     prone outline...while the breathing remains steady, the body
     does not rise and fall.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (anxious, barking a command to Chloe)
              Phone him.

     Chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials.

                           CHRI STOF
                      (anticipating Chloe's question)
              Wrong number.

     The phone on the bedside table, inches from Truman's head,
     begins to ring.  Truman doesn't flinch.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     SYLVIA walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a
     late night swim.  Hearing the telephone ringing; she rushes
     to pick it up.  However, after lifting the receiver, the phone
     continues to ring.

     The sound is coming from her television, left on in the bureau.
     On the screen, TRUMAN sleeps, seemingly undisturbed by the call.
     Sylvia, drying herself, watches with fascination.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF and the CREW are now highly agitated.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (a trace of panic)
              He didn't drink tonight?  No pills?

     Every question receives a shake of the Assistant's head in
     reply.

                           CHRISTOF
              Hang up!

     Chloe promptly cuts the connection and Truman's phone
     ceases to ring.

                           CHRISTOF
              Get Marlon over there.

                           CHLOE
              Under what pretext?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (letting his anxiety show)
              Any fucking pretext!

     Christof turns his back on the monitors, his mind racing.


     EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     MARLON's car squeals to a halt outside Truman's house.
     Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest, he
     dashes barefoot to the front door.  He tries the doorhandle,
     pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously,
     shouting Truman's name all the while.

                           MARLON
              Tru!..Tru!..

     Frustrated, Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the
     window. He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but
     his shouts fail to rouse him.  Marlon picks up one of Meryl's
     carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window.

                           MARLON
                      (shouting a warning)
              I'm comin' in, Tru!

     Marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower
     of glass over Truman's bed.  Still he doesn't move.  Marlon
     reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the
     window frame and unlatches the window.


     NT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     MARLON clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands
     in an awkward heap on the floor beside TRUMAN's bed.

     He pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally
     stands at his co-star's bedside.  There is a hissing sound.
     Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover.  Beneath the bedding is a
     life-size inflatable female doll.

     The doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly
     deflating.  Lying beside the doll's chest is Truman's portable
     tape recorder.  Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next
     to his ear.  The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF, wide-eyed, stares at the image on the On-Air monitor
     of MARLON and his bizarre companion.  Marlon is frozen, staring
     into camera.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (quiet but firm)
              Cut transmission.

     Simeon hesitates, unsure if has heard correctly.  He looks to
     Christof for confirmation, his finger poised over an
     "EMERGENCY" button.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (enraged)
              I said, "Cut"!

     Christof lunges forward and presses the button himself.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     SYLVIA watches agog as the scene in Truman's bedroom on
     her television screen is replaced by the "TRUMAN" logo and the
     message, "TECHNICAL FAULT.  PLEASE STAND BY."


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM NIGHT.

     CHRISTOF has taken his place at the control panel.  On the bank
     of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the OPERATORS
     systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Truman's
     home and neighborhood.  Occasionally MARLON or an EXTRA appear
     in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt.

     While the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card,
     Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor
     playing in fast-rewind, time code in the bottom right corner.
     It is a recording of the night's transmission.  Simeon stops on
     the last on-camera appearance by TRUMAN.

     They watch Truman, on-screen, switch off his bedroom light and
     climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers
     over his head.  As the light is switched off, the recording
     camera automatically switches to night vision.  Simeon continues
     to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast-
     forward mode.  Christof suddenly points to the screen.

                           CHRISTOF
              There.  Freeze...Zoom into the chair...

     Simeon types the appropriate command.

                           CHRISTOF
              Enhance.

     On the blown-up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg,
     it is barely possible to make out Truman's hand as he crawls
     commando-style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement
     already positioned in the bed.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (referring to the debris)
              He wasn't making a mess.  He was engineering
              a blind spot.

                           CHLOE
              How does he know where the cameras are?

                           CHRI STOF
              I don't know.
                      (noting the time-code on the monitor,
                      staring into the back of Simeon's head)
              All I know is we've been filming a blow-up
              doll for the last three hours.

     Simeon feels the hostility.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     The systematic search of the monitors continues.  They now
     reveal that dawn has broken on the set.

                           SIMEON
                      (hanging up the phone)
              We've declared a curfew.  Only the extras
              required for the search are on the set.
              Everyone else is at first positions.

                           CHRISTOF
              All prop cars accounted for?

                           SIMEON
              He has to be on foot.  He has the world's
              most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.

     All heads turn to CHLOE as she enters the grand control room
     with a status report.

                           CHLOE
              The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug
              if we don't make a statement within the next
              hour.  The media is in a feeding frenzy.  The phone
              lines are jammed.  Every network has a pirated shot
              of Harlon and the dummy.


     EXT.  VACANT LOT.  DAY.

     TRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his
     clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud.

     He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a
     shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags.
     Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his
     shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn.


     EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  DAY.

     TRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge.
     Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car
     approaching.  As it nears, we recognize a police car.

     Truman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in
     the search.  The car slowly draws alongside, the POLICE OFFICER
     looking straight into Truman's blackened face.

                           POLICE OFFICER
              Any sign of him?

                           TRUMAN
                      (deliberately gravelling his voice)
              Not yet.

     The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman.  After what
     seems like an eternity, he motions his PARTNER to drive on.

                           POLICE OFFICER
                      (to Truman, as the car pulls away)
              Take it easy.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  DAY.

     We pan down one concrete canyon after another.  The usually
     bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted.

     Suddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street.
     Then another and another.

     PEOPLE of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching
     down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted
     at a crime scene.  The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS
     linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES
     and SECRETARIES, STORE CLERKS, TELEPHONISTS, MAINTENANCE and
     CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WAITERS and WAITRESSES, COOKS, SHOPPERS,
     HEALTH WORKERS, SECURITY GUARDS, POSTAL WORKERS, POLICE
     OFFICERS, FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE.  On one occasion we
     glimpse Truman's colleagues, LAWRENCE, ERROL and VIVIEN, amongst
     the searchers.

     A building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search
     is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the
     searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such
     as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and
     shrubbery.

     We focus on one of the waves of searchers.  TRUMAN has linked
     arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up.

     A swarm of helicopters fills the sky.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     While his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens, CHRISTOF has
     been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives, MOSES and
     ROMAN.

                           MOSES
                      (to Christof who is still studying
                      the faces in a row of SEARCHERS)
              Rumors are circulating he's dead.

                           ROMAN
                      (pacing nervously)
              The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (unconcerned, referring to the static
                      "STAND BY" graphic, now accompanied by
                      soothing classical music)
              Why?  We're getting higher ratings for
              that graphic than any time in the series.


     INT.  BARROOM.  DAY.

     The television behind the bar carries the still graphic.
     BAR PATRONS animatedly discuss Truman's fate over their drinks.
     Some place bets with each other over the outcome.


     EXT.  ELECTRONICS STORE.  DAY.

     A crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions
     in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments.


     INT.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

     The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the
     graphic on their televisions.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     The fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to
     make another sweep.

                           CHLOE
                      (referring to the empty streets)
              When we flush him out how do we explain this?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (deadpan)
              We tell him the truth.

     Chloe looks askance at Christof.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (joking darkly)
              We're making a movie.

                           SIMEON
                      (hopeful)
              We'll get him on this next sweep.

                           CHRISTOF
              What have we missed?

                           SIMEON
              It's just a matter of time.

                           CHRISTOF
              No.  We've missed something.

     Christof turns his back on the screens.  Over his shoulder,
     we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor.


     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN - PIER 13.  DAY.

     TRUMAN has broken away from the line of searchers, on the
     pretext of taking a leak.  He is standing on the edge of
     Pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning
     their next sweep.  Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green
     and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street
     Racquet Club.

     We see a close up of Truman's terrified eyes in his blackened
     face, staring down at the lapping water.  It triggers a montage
     of flashbacks.  As usual the images all appear to play on a
     television screen.

     TRUMAN on the CLIFF FACE at seven years old, his second grade
     teacher SISTER OLIVIA, a close-up of DROWNING STATISTICS at
     his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the FERRY
     TERMINAL, seventeen-year old SYLVIA jumping in the fountain, his
     WATERBED rocking, and seven-year old Truman sitting on the
     UPTURNED BOAT in Long Island Sound crying into the darkness.


     EXT.  PIER 13.  DAY.

     TRUMAN comes back to reality.  He steels himself, shuts out the
     doubts and dives into the water.


     EXT.  NEW YORK HARBOR.  DAY.

     Underwater we see TRUMAN panicking at the shock of the cold
     sea, arms and legs flailing.  Suddenly he stops and sinks for a
     moment in the weight of his clothes.  Then slowly he rises to
     the surface and begins to swim.

     Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus'
     flagship, The Santa Maria.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF is spooling through significant scenes in the history
     of "TRUMAN" on a preview monitor.

     He pauses on the scene of SYLVIA and TRUMAN at the fountain
     in Flushing Meadow Park in the show's seventeenth season.
     Sylvia has her finger to Truman's lips.  Christof presses
     "PLAY" on the mixing desk.

                           SYLVIA
                      (from monitor)
              You remember when you were a little boy...

     Christof fast forwards, then presses PLAY once again.

                           SYLVIA
              ...Trust that boy...

     Christof jabs the "PAUSE" button, freezing the picture.  He
     recites the words to himself.

                           CHRISTOF
              Trust that boy...
                      (to Simeon)
              We're not watching the sea.

                           SIMEON
                      (confused)
              Why would we?

                           CHRISTOF
              Sweep the harbor.


     EXT.  NEW YOUR HARBOR.  DAY.

     TRUMAN is at the wheel of the Santa Maria, wind filling her
     sails.  Covering the face of the ship's compass is Sylvia's
     composite picture.

     His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor.  As the archaic
     vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget, the bridge
     appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight.  Truman steers
     around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the
     horizon.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on
     a preview monitor, skimming over the calm, featureless sea.
     Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched
     against the horizon.

                           SIMEON
              That's him!

                           CHRISTOF
              Resume transmission.

     Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is
     instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     SYLVIA, dozing on the sofa, suddenly blinks open her eyes as the
     classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the
     sound of a helicopte's rotor blade.

     Sylvia focuses on the screen, her breath taken away by the sight
     of TRUMAN at the wheel of the Santa Maria.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring intently at the On-Air monitor)
              What do we have on that boat?

     Simeon scans a computer shot list.  He types in a code.  A
     camera from the main mast of Truman's ship activates.  Truman,
     unaware of the camera, is concentrating on steering the vessel.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN is out of sight of land, the sea choppier now, rising
     and falling beneath his boat.  He nears a large buoy bobbing
     clumsily in the strong swell.  An official-looking sign is
     attached - "DANGER.  NAVAL EXERCISES.  DO NOT ENTER."  We see an
     extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised
     miniature camera tracks Truman's progress.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF and the other PRODUCTION STAFF watch TRUMAN from the
     buoy's POV as he sails by.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN hears a helicopter overhead.  By now the ocean spray has
     washed most of the dirt from his face, only a residue remains.
     The rags he wears, including Sylvia's sweater under his open
     coat, are soaked.  Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass.

     As he steers, he occasionally refers to a "HOW TO SAIL" book
     from his coat pocket.  He tacks against the wind, as he watches
     the military chopper circle his boat.

                           CHOPPER PILOT
                      (over P.A.)
              Alter course immediately.  You are
              entering a restricted area.

     Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper.

                           TRUMAN
              Fuck you!


     EXT.  A STREET SOMEWHERE.  DAY.

     Two YOUNG MEN on a street corner watch, transfixed, the image
     of TRUMAN steering the Santa Maria on a portable Watchman TV.

                           YOUNG MAN 1
              I knew he wasn't dead.


     INT.  HELICOPTER.  DAY.


     The HELICOPTER PILOT continues to circle.

                           PILOT (over P.A.)
              Alter course or we fire on your vessel.

     TRUMAN screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the
     pilot.

                           TRUMAN
              Get the hell away!  It's my life!


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (into microphone to pilot, eerily composed)
              Fire a warning.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     A round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows
     of Truman's boat, several rounds striking the deck.  TRUMAN
     flinches.  In his eyes we see the ghosts return.  With great
     effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare
     gun from the storage cabinet in the boat's wheel house.

                           CHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.)
              Alter course.  Drop your sails.

     Truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun.  The
     distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter, narrowly
     missing.  Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

                           SIMEON
                      (shocked at the near miss)
              Jesus!  God!  Is he out of his mind?

                           CHRISTOF
                      (composed, into microphone to pilot)
              Pull back.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     Before the chopper can take evasive action TRUMAN takes aim a
     second time and fires.  The distress flare fishtails into the
     sky and to Truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark,
     striking the rear rotor blade.  Truman lets out a whoop.

     The helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards
     the sea.  The CHOPPER PILOTS bail out of the cockpit, splashing
     down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves
     in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like
     a stone.  Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in
     their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade Truman's
     head.  He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering
     away from the drifting pilots.  A look of resolve in his eyes we
     have never witnessed before.


     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.

     SYLVIA kneels on the floor in front of the television.  As
     Christof's cameras dwell on her likeness - the composite picture
     still covering the ship's compass - she allows herself a brief
     moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON, and the OTHERS have been joined in the
     control room by MARLON, MERYL, KIRK and AUDREY.

                           CHRISTOF
              How long will another chopper take?

                           SIMEON
              By the time we pick up the pilots, too long.

                           CHRISTOF
              We have to stop him for his own good.
              Turn him back with the elements.

                           SIMEON
                      (hesitant)
              There's no rescue boat in the area.  He
              won't know what to do.

                           MOSES
                      (trying to appeal to Christof's
                      sense of reason)
              For God's sake, Chris.  The whole world
              is watching.  We can't kill him in front
              of a live audience.

                           CHRISTOF
              He was born in front of a live audience.
                      (never taking his eyes from
                      the screen, reassuring)
              Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life
              for the truth.  His doubts will turn him back.

     Simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk
     marked "WAVE", "WIND" and "RAIN".  After typing in a command, he
     winds the controls towards their maximum settings.

                           CHRISTOF
              Kill the lights.

     Chloe searches Christof's face, trying to find the man in whom
     she has believed for so long.


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     Darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards Truman's
     boat at an alarming speed.  High winds buffet the boat.  TRUMAN
     fights the wheel.  Hurricane force winds shake the masts and
     keel, ripping the sails to shreds.

     The picture of Sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the
     sea.  His "HOW TO SAIL" book skids off the deck.

     Truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes
     himself to the wheel to secure himself on board.

                           TRUMAN
                      (shouting above the storm)
              I'm coming to find you Sylvia!  I'm making
              myself deaf!
                      (screaming up to the sky)
              You're going to have to kill me!  Come on!

     Monstrous waves continually submerge the deck.  Truman continues
     to head into the teeth of the gale.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.

     In contrast to his panic-stricken COLLEAGUES, CHRISTOF gives an
     outward appearance of calm.  However a bead of sweat appearing
     at his temple betrays him.

                           SIMEON
                      (agitated)
              It's not working.  He can sail that thing!

                           ROMAN
              How can he sail?!  He's in insurance!  He
              hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven!

                           MOSES
                      (to Christof)
              On the behalf of the studio, I demand you
              cease transmission.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (defiant, to Operators)
              Keep running!
                      (to Moses)
              I take full responsibility.
                      (to Operator in front of radar-style screen)
              How close?

                           OPERATOR
              Very close.

                           CHRISTOF
              Capsize him!  Tip him over!

                           CHLOE
                      (unable to contain herself
                      any longer, entreating him)
              You can't!  He's tied himself to the wheel.
              He'll drown!

                           SIMEON
                      (staring at Truman on the monitor,
                      becoming affected by his display of courage)
              He doesn't care...

                           CHLOE
                      (to Christof, lunging for the control panel)
              You lied, you hypocrite!  The only way he can
              leave, is dead!

     Chloe lunges for the control panel but Christof throws her to
     the floor.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (enraged)
              Do it!

     All eyes turn in Christof's direction, as he confirms Chloe's
     accusation.

                           SIMEON
                      (staring at the On-Air monitor, numb)
              It's too late...


     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.

     TRUMAN appears to be losing his fight against the storm,
     each successive breaker taking its toll on his body, sapping
     his strength, his bindings the only thing holding him upright,
     his head slumps, the wheel goes loose in his grasp, spinning
     out of control.  His will, draining away.

     As he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his
     arm into the handles of the spinning wheel.  He cries out in
     pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the
     wheel.  He braces for one last wave.

     But the wave does not come.  A strange phenomenon is occurring
     in the ocean.  A distinct division has appeared in the ocean
     swell.  Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of
     calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane.

     The wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting.
     Truman steers his vessel down this "sea-lane".

     After some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the
     horizon.  Land?  Islands?  As Truman steers towards the nearest
     shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations.
     It is certainly not the moon.

     The dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is
     exposed above the surface of the sea.  The ocean swell is being
     caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on
     either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed.
     In fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in
     both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see,
     the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers.

     Truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines.  The exposed
     half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its
     length equivalent to several football fields.  The massive arms
     perpetually churn.

     Truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly
     past the giant rotating drum.  The water beyond the rollers is
     dead calm.  Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his
     eyes.

     But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to
     comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that
     greets him.  His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow
     collision course with the sky.  That infinitely receding horizon
     line recedes no more.

     The sea really does meet the sky.  The join is only too
     apparent.  Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of
     colossal dimensions.  The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop.
     Truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the
     sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight.

     The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping
     gently into its latex surface.  Truman unties his bindings
     and stumbles across the deck to the side rail.  Clinging to the
     rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the
     painted cyclorama.  He touches the sky.

     He feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it.
     Hie eyes well up with tears.  He presses his distraught face
     into it.  He screams at the top of his voice.  No words.  A
     primal scream.  A pained, animal howl.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF and his PRODUCTION STAFF take in Truman's reaction
     in silence.


     INT/EXT.  BARROOM/ELECTRONICS STORE/HOME.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and
     streets - wherever a television is to be found.  No VIEWER
     speaks.  They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed.


     EXT.  CYCLORAMA.  DUSK.

     As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve
     of the cyclorama, TRUMAN's attention is drawn to an outline in
     the otherwise flawless backdrop.  He clambers to the prow of the
     boat.

     There, camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water
     line, is a door.  Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle
     and halts the drifting boat.  He stands in front of the door and
     closes his eyes in a silent prayer.

     He opens the door in the sky and steps through.


     INT/EXT.  VIEWERS.  DUSK.

     Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their
     various locations - bars, homes and offices.  Strangers hug each
     other and dance in celebration.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     Even the cynical VIDEO OPERATOR jumps out of his seat - for the
     first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop, forgetting
     himself for a moment, caught up in the drama.

                           OPERATOR
              Yeah!

     Self-conscious, he takes his seat again almost immediately.  His
     COLLEAGUES are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing
     to play its only available shot, the open door in the sky -
     Truman out of view.


     INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN finds himself on a small metal landing.  A steel ladder
     rises above him to the height of "sky", the soundstage roof, so
     high as to be barely visible.  The rungs also continue downward,
     the depth of the "ocean-bed", to a studio floor far below.

     Truman turns and looks back through the door he has just
     entered.  Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away.
     The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an
     enormous tank.  The sky, a massive cyclorama.  New York City, an
     elaborate set.  And it is all housed within an impossibly large
     soundstage.

     Truman makes no effort to save the boat.  He shuts the door to
     his world.  A sign on the back of the door reads, "CLOSED SET.
     No Unauthorized Access."  Gradually he becomes aware of another
     strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage.  All around
     him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to
     masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an
     automatic timer.  (The light fixtures match the one that almost
     struck Truman's car at the beginning of the film.)

     By artificial starlight, Truman begins his long descent of the
     step ladder.  Below, a studio tram makes its way along the
     soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day.


     INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.

     As he drives, a well-scrubbed, young TOUR GUIDE delivers his
     tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to
     the half-full tram of STUDIO VISITORS.

                           GUIDE
              ...the soundstage roof houses over eight
              hundred thousand lights of varying intensities
              to faithfully recreate the constellations...

     However, the passengers are paying less attention than usual.
     They stare, perplexed, at the television monitor above the
     Guide's head, continuing to play the show's only available shot
     of the open door in the sky.


     INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN suddenly steps in front of the tram.  The TOUR GUIDE
     stands on the brakes, tram lurching to a stop.  The Guide looks
     from Truman's haunted face to the monitor, hardly able to
     believe his eyes.

     Truman leaps on board, pressing his flare gun into the side of
     the guide's head.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the shocked passengers)
              Nobody move!
                      (to the guide)
              Drive!

     The terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram, resuming the
     tour.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to the guide, gesturing to the microphone)
              Keep talking.  Say whatever you say!

     The Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone.

                           GUIDE
               Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred
               and fifty million gallons of man-made salt
               water, temperature-controlled...

     Truman's attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram -
     "TRUMAN STUDIO TOUR".  He is suddenly aware of the tourists
     gawking at him.

                           TRUMAN
                      (to TOURIST, camcorder around his neck)
              Act normal!  Keep filming!

     Truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of STUDIO SECURITY CARS
     speeds towards the tram.  But they streak past, on their way to
     the site of Truman's escape.  As he tentatively gets back to his
     feet, Truman finds a CHILD standing in front of him with an
     autograph book.

                           CHILD
              Please, Mister Truman.

     On the child's T-shirt, a large photograph of Truman's face.


     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.

     CHRISTOF talks anxiously on the phone, unaware of a shift in the
     balance of power taking place behind his back.  The executives,
     MOSES and ROMAN are huddling with SIMEON, making him an offer he
     appears to welcome.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (into the phone)
              What do you mean he's not there?  We can't
              have lost him again.

     On the far side of the control room, behind a huge curved
     glass wall on a mezzanine floor, a studio tour tram passes by.


     INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN crouches behind a seat on the tram, flare gun still
     trained on the guide's head, taking in the gigantic video wall
     displaying pictures from every facet of his life.

     His heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private
     spot where he and SYLVIA met.

                           GUIDE
              ...on your left, the control room where the
              angles are selected and the actors receive
              direction.  Of course, the one place we can't
              show you is the story department.  There is none.
                      (hesitant)
              ...Truman writes the script...

     From Truman's POV we watch CHLOE approach CHRISTOF.  She has a
     pure white envelope in her hands.  As Christof looks up to
     acknowledge her, he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the
     tram.


     INT.  STUDIO LOT.  DUSK.

     Still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard
     of an indoor shopping mall.  Truman gift shops.

     TRUMAN is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays
     full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles
     such as, "TrumanTrivia".  Video cassettes offering "Truman
     Highlights".  His face emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, coffee mugs
     and posters.  Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying
     Oldsmobile are offered for sale.

     The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end.
     STUDIO POLICE are checking the disembarking PASSENGERS.  Truman,
     using the TOUR GUIDE as a shield, also exits the tram.

                           GUIDE
                      (frightened for his life)
              Here he is!  It's him!

     Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and
     makes a run for it.  The guards give chase.  Truman runs into a
     lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his
     own, promoting "TrumanWear".  He pulls his "double" to the
     ground to block the guards' path.

     Sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end.

                           GUARD
                      (into radio)
              We've got him trapped.

     Truman enters a doorway marked "NO ENTRY" to find a stairway
     leading upwards.  He takes the stairs three at a time.

     The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind.  Flight
     after flight of stairs.  At one point, he loses his grip on the
     stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for
     an eternity down the stairwell.

     He finally emerges on a landing.  Lungs bursting.  One more
     door.  He tries the handle.  It opens.


     EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.

     TRUMAN finds himself on the roof of the soundstage.  Outside.
     Really outside for the first time in his life.

     He looks frantically around him.  Nowhere to hide.  The
     soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the
     eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof.

     Facing him, a colossal Burbank.  Several other soundstages
     almost as gigantic as his own.  The palm trees lining the
     streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns.

     The Hollywood Freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of
     traffic, twenty lanes wide.  Gargantuan office buildings
     eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known.

     Directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its
     arched entranceway.

     Above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky.  The real
     moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating
     for the last thirty-four years.

     Truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone.  A
     GROUP has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent
     in a semi-circle, cutting off any escape.

     Along with the STUDIO GUARDS, keeping their distance in the
     background, are CHLOE, SIMEON, and the two studio executives,
     MOSES and ROMAN.  In front of them, the co-stars in his life -
     MARLON, MERYL, sister RAQUEL, mother AUDREY and supposedly dead
     father KIRK.  No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the
     familiar faces.  Marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the
     eye.

     Truman's gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing
     at the head of the group.  CHRISTOF.  He approaches Truman
     alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a
     father calls to a son.

                           CHRISTOF
              Truman...

     Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his
     life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time.  As they
     stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first
     time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof.  For a
     moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky.

                           TRUMAN
                      (quietly, half to himself,
                      half to Christof)
              Even the stars I wished on...

     As Truman turns his attention back to Christof, he suddenly
     lunges at him, catching him off-guard, the envelope slipping
     from Christof's hand.  With a strength he never knew he
     possessed, Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage
     roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world.

     Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself.  The
     studio guards dare not move.

                           CHRISTOF
                      (staring into the chasm,
                      remaining eerily calm)
              You won't do it, Truman.  I've watched you
              your whole life.

                           TRUMAN
                      (meeting Christof's gaze)
              You never had a camera in my head.

     Suddenly the doubts flood into Christof's eyes, fearing he
     has misjudged Truman, fearing for his life.

                           TRUMAN
                      (incensed)
              Something was real!
                      (a terrifying anguish)
              Something had to be real!

     It takes all of Truman's will not to hurl the old man into the
     abyss.  Christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white
     envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in
     the moonlight.

     Truman follows Christof's gaze.  Contemptuously tossing Christof
     aside, he retrieves the envelope.  Christof crawls to safety,
     thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and
     insignificant.

     But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer
     exist in Truman's mind.  Truman gazes at his name for a long
     moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully
     breaks the seal.  Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to
     be slowly revealed.  A photograph.  A close up of SYLVIA's face
     including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever-elusive nose.

     A serenity comes over Truman.  He lifts up his eyes to the
     mountains on the far horizon.  As he stands on the very edge of
     the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we
     commence a long, slow pull-back.

     Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall
     of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic
     picture of his face and proclaiming, "TRUMAN - Total Record of a
     Human Life.  34TH GREAT YEAR!"

     We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on
     top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame.


     A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS

     The two OLD WOMEN in the living room, the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the
     two YOUNG MEN with the Watchman TV, the PATRONS in the bar,
     PASSERS-BY outside an electronics store are all captivated by
     their television sets.

     We focus on the screen of a television.  A small FEMALE BABY
     sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Truman's old
     suburban home in Queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his
     life.  The infant's doting parents, MARLON and the new actress
     VIVIEN, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child.  A border
     around the action on the screen announces, "ZOE - Total
     Record Of a Human Life".

     Suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen.
     A BABY stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the
     television set in Sylvia's house.

     TRUMAN bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the
     air, much to the child's delight.  Truman dwells for a moment
     on the mirror-image scene on the television before very
     deliberately shutting it off.

     SYLVIA joins Truman and their daughter.  Together, they exit
     the beach house.  We follow them as they make their way onto the
     deserted sand and down towards the sea.

          I'd never given much thought to how I would die..
          
          Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither 
          bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. 
          
          Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. 
          Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast.
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - MOVING
          
          Trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches 
          are dodged with preternatural agility. And we're speeding
          up, chasing something. It's exhilarating. Terrifying. 
          Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey -
          -
          
          
          A DEER
          
          
          -- running for its life as it darts through this maze of 
          a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer, 
          SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the
          trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it, 
          about to emerge from the shadowy darkness -
          -
          
          
          The deer LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly 
          SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun... then BAM! 
          
          
          The deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle, 
          leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen. HOLD ON WHITENESS

          Eyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, 
          dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable,
          introverted, imperfect beauty.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          
          ... So I can't bring myself to

          here to die...

          Bella stands at the end of a cul-de-sac on the desert's edge.
          The sun blazes behind her -- she bends down and carefully 
          scoops a tiny BARREL CACTUS into a clay pot.

          ... The decision to leave home.
          
          She stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until 
          
          
          BLONDE #1 (O.S.)
          Bye, Bella!
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - McMansion ACROSS THE STREET 
          
          
          Three tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible 
          Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts 
          with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave.
          
          
          BLONDE #
          Good luck at your new school! 
          
          
          They ADLIB superficial good wishes, "Don't forget to write;"
          
          "We'll miss you." Bella waves back, sweetly, but 
          halfheartedly as she steps off the curb.
          
          
          BELLA
          Have a good..
          
          --and trips. When she rights herself, they're already gone.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... life. 
          
          
          Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and
          innate intelligence become apparent as -
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's
          low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic, 
          scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She 
          thrusts a cell phone at Bella. 
          
          
          RENE
          It won't work again, baby. 
          
          
          BELLA
          You put it on hold. 
          
          
          RENE
          I did? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Look. You also called Mexico.
          
          
          Rene pushes her playfully, they laugh.
          
          
          
          3.
          RENE
          I'll figure it out. You gotta be able 
          to reach me and Phil on the road - 
          I 
          love saying that - on the road.
          
          
          BELLA
          Very romantic.
          
          
          PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete's body, exits the
          house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease. 
          
          
          PHIL
          If you call crappy motels, backwater 
          towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.
          
          
          He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene's head with 
          a
          kiss. Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella. Phil heads to the old
          station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm 
          through Bella's, clinging to her as they walk to car.
          
          
          RENE
          Now, you know if you change your 
          mind, I'll race back here from 
          wherever the game is. 
          
          
          But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great 
          sacrifice that would be. Bella forces a smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          I won't change my mind, mom.
          
          
          RENE
          You might. You've always hated Forks. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It's not about Forks, it's about 
          Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we 
          barely know each other. 
          
          
          (off Rene's still worried 
          look)
          Mom, I want to go. I'll be fine.
          
          
          But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA'S FACE 
          dread, doubt, regret. Off Bella, struggling to keep her 
          facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car..

          Bella, IPOD earbuds in her ears, gets a last glimpse of the 
          sparkling malls, chic shoppers, manicured cactus gardens..

          The McMansions get smaller as we SWEEP OVER the scorched 
          landscape, baking under a hot sun. Beyond the housing 
          developments SEE the rocky, dry desert, extending for miles..
          . 
          
          
          Rise HIGHER, and higher still, until finally we're suspended
          within the bright, perfect, blue SKY, with only an occasional 
          cloud..
          . 
          
          
          Slowly, the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, darker..
          . 
          until we're completely immersed in them... the sun disappearing.
          Finally, we EMERGE from the clouds to find below

          5 EXT. WASHINGTON STATE - OLYMPIC PENINSULA (AERIAL SHOT)- DAY5
          
          
          Nothing but deep, dark, green forests for miles. SWEEP DOWN, 
          finding the eerily dramatic Lake Crescent. Over it all hangs 
          the mist from the ever-present cloudy grey sky. Everything 
          is wet and green and drenched in shade..
          .

          6 INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY - WAITING AT LIGHT 
          6
          
          
          Bella sits next to her uniformed father, police chief CHARLIE 
          SWAN, 40's. Taciturn, introverted like Bella. Their strained 
          silence contrasts Bella's relationship with her mother. Beat.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your hair's longer.
          
          
          BELLA
          I cut it since last time I saw you. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Guess it grew out again.
          
          
          She just nods. Silence.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          How's your mom?
          
          
          BELLA
          Good. 
          
          
          More silence. Yikes. They pass a SIGN: The City Of Forks
          Welcomes You - Pop. 3246. Bella sighs.

          7
          
          
          As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this logging town 
          -
          every storefront has a wood carving. The Timber Museum's sign is
          two loggers sawing a stump. The POLICE STATION is a small wooden 
          building across from City Hall..

          8 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
          8
          
          
          The cruiser pulls up to the old two-story house. A woodshed full 
          of firewood. There's a small boat in the garage, fishing gear, an
          old buoy. Bella climbs out... home.
          
          
          9 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
          9
          
          
          Bella and Charlie carry in her bags. The house isn't stylish
          (the only new thing here is a Flat Screen T.V.), but it's
          comfortable, lived-in. Lots of fishing memorabilia; photos 
          of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian BILLY BLACK. 
          
          
          Handmade cards to Daddy and photos of Bella. She winces at
          herself, age 7, in a tutu, sitting stubbornly on the ground. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          I put Grandpa's old desk in your 
          
          
          room. And I cleared some shelves 
          
          
          in the bathroom. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (grimacing)
          That's right. One bathroom.
          
          
          Bella's eye lands on a PHOTO of a much younger Charlie and
          Rene, on vacation, beaming with love. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'll just put these up in your room 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          I can do it 
          -
          
          
          They both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly. 
          Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs.
          
          
          10 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY 10
          
          
          An antique rolltop desk sits in a corner. The room is filled with 
          childhood remnants that have seen better days. As she unpacks her 
          CD case, loneliness finally overwhelms her. She sits heavily on 
          the edge of the bed, tears threatening..
          . 
          
          
          Then we hear a HONK outside. Bella runs across the hall and looks 
          out the window to see 
          -
          
          
          11 OUTSIDE - A FADED RED TRUCK, CIRCA 1960 pulls up... 11

          EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          
          Bella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK, 
          16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of 
          childish roundness in his face. The two of them help Jacob's
          father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella, you remember Billy Black. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Glad you're finally here. Charlie 
          hasn't shut up about it since you 
          told him you were coming. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you 
          down the hill. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Right after I ram you in the ankles.
          
          
          Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges. Jacob shakes 
          his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella.
          
          
          JACOB
          I'm Jacob. We made mud pies 
          together when we were little kids. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Yeah... I think I remember..
          .
          (re: the dads)
          Are they always like this?
          
          
          JACOB
          It's getting worse with old age.
          
          
          Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella 
          -
          
          
          CHARLIE
          So what do you think of your 
          homecoming gift?
          
          
          BELLA
          No way. The truck is for me?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just bought it off Billy, here. 
          
          
          JACOB
          I rebuilt the engine and -
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          It's perfect!
          
          
          
          7.
          She beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her.
          She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her. 
          
          
          JACOB
          Okay, so you gotta double pump the 
          clutch when you shift, but -
          -
          
          
          He hands her the keys as she climbs in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
          
          
          JACOB
          I go to school on the reservation.
          
          
          BELLA
          Too bad. Would've been nice to 
          know at least one person.

          Bella just looks at him. Is he for real?

          Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack! 
          
          
          Unfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella. She closes 
          her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it. It flies off court 
          -
          
          
          -- and beans a basketball player in the head. He is MIKE 
          NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair. 
          
          
          MIKE 
          Ow!
          
          
          BELLA
          (hurries to him, 
          
          
          embarrassed)
          Are you alright? I warned them not 
          to make me play.
          
          
          MIKE
          It's only a flesh wound.
          
          
          Mike grins and she smiles, relieved. A BELL RINGS, class over. 
          
          
          MIKE
          You're Isabella, right? 
          
          
          
          9.
          BELLA
          Just Bella. 
          
          
          MIKE
          I'm Mike. Newton.
          
          
          He looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her -
          -
          Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them. Subtle, 
          but possessive as she nudges Mike.
          
          
          JESSICA
          She's got a great spike, doesn't 
          she? 
          
          
          (to Bella)
          So, you're from Arizona, right? 
          Aren't people supposed to be tan 
          down there?
          
          
          BELLA
          That's why they kicked me out.
          
          
          Mike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does. Bella just 
          feels uncomfortable with the attention..
          .
          
          
          15 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 15
          
          
          FOLLOW Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to 
          a 
          table. Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella. 
          
          
          ERIC
          Mike, you met my home girl Bella. 
          
          
          MIKE
          Your home girl?
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
           (to Bella)
          It's first grade all over again, 
          and you're the shiny new toy.
          
          
          Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella. 
          She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, 
          low key, insecure friend. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          Sorry, needed a candid for the feature 
          -
          
          
          ERIC
          Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it 
          up again.
          
          
          (to Bella)
          I got your back, baby.
          
          
          
          10.
          ANGELA
          
          
          (disappointed)
          Guess we'll just run another editorial on 
          teen drinking. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Sorry. There's always eating disorders, 
          or Speedo padding on the swim team 
          -
          
          
          ANGELA
          -- Wait, that's a good one..
          .
          
          
          But Bella's attention is now riveted to 
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE CAFETERIA 
          
          
          They swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella's
          ever seen enter (IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS. Two guys, two 
          girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes..
          . 
          and all devastatingly beautiful. 
          
          
          They move through the room with effortless grace, and take a seat 
          at a table furthest from Bella's. Bella leans over to Jessica and
          Angela.
          
          
          BELLA
          Who are they?
          
          
          ANGELA
          The Cullens. 
          
          
          Jessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster 
          kids. They all moved down here 
          from Alaska two years ago. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          They kinda keep to themselves.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Because they're all together. 
          Like, together together. The 
          blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big 
          dark-haired guy, Emmett..
          .
          
          
          ON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it. 
          Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight 
          lifter, but a playful glint in his eye. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          ... they're a thing. I'm not even
          sure that's legal.
          
          
          
          11.
          ANGELA
          Jess, they're not actually related. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          But they live together. And the 
          little dark haired girl, Alice, 
          she's really weird..
          . 
          
          
          ON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, 
          black hair going in every direction. She hovers over, JASPER, 18, 
          honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured.
          
          
          JESSICA
          ... she's with Jasper, the blonde 
          who looks like he's in pain. 
          I 
          mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster 
          dad slash match maker. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          Maybe he'll adopt me.
          
          
          Bella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems 
          inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But 
          the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Who's he?
          
          
          JESSICA
          That's Edward Cullen.
          
          
          Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from 
          across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems..
          . 
          confused. Bella quickly looks away. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          He's totally gorgeous, obviously. 
          But apparently, no one here is good 
          enough for him. Like I care. 
          
          
          (she obviously does)
          Anyway, don't waste your time. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I wasn't planning on it.
          
          
          But Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring
          at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression 
          that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair.
          
          
          16 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 16
          
          
          A room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a table. Bella 
          and Mike enter. 
          
          
          
          12.
          Mike takes his seat and points her toward MR. MOLINA, 
          Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of 
          the class. As Bella moves to the teacher with her class 
          slip, she notes 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as 
          she passes Edward's table..
          .
          
          
          SLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts 
          a 
          piece of paper next to Edward. We're still on his back as he
          inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the edge of 
          the table, crumbling it slightly. No one notices. 
          
          
          Mr. Molina takes Bella's class slip. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as 
          best you can till you get caught 
          up. 
          
          
          Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward. 
          But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when 
          -
          
          
          ON EDWARD'S FACE -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal
          black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill..
          .
          
          
          Bella knocks someone's book bag off their chair. Replaces it,
          mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her seat. 
          Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          
          
          (to the class, animated)
          
          
          Today we'll be observing the behavior 
          
          
          of planaria, a.k.a flatworms.
          
          
          As Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table 
          -
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          We're going to cut them in half, 
          then watch them regenerate into two 
          separate worms..
          . 
          
          
          Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over 
          his nose as if he smells something horrible. 
          
          
          Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing. 
          Then she sniffs her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr.
          Molina hands Edward two petri dishes.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They 
          just won't die.
          
          
          Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the 
          table to Bella as if she had Ebola. She takes her dish, and 
          makes a dark curtain of her hair between them. 
          
          
          
          13.
          She can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table. Clenched into
          fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure..
          .
          
          
          17 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 17
          
          
          -- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door. Other kids 
          and Bella exit a moment later. Bella looks down the hall; 
          he's gone. 
          
          
          18 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 18
          
          
          Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 
          40's. He doesn't see Bella enter.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          There must be something open sixth 
          
          
          period. Physics? Biochem?
          
          
          ADMINISTRATOR
          
          
          No, every class is full. I'm 
          
          
          afraid you'll have to stay in 
          
          
          biology. I'm so sorry. 
          
          
          Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and gestures for 
          her to wait a minute. 
          
          
          But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella. He slowly 
          turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes. She backs 
          to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled... with fear. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          (to the Administrator)
          I'll just... endure it. 
          
          
          He strides out the door. Off Bella..

          19 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 19
          
          
          Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens,
          while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck. The many eyes still 
          watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches

          getting mad. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Jerk.
          
          
          As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to 
          hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH

          move blindingly fast past him. He jerks around, then another 
          SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow. He BOLTS!
          
          
          He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of 
          the mill striating him. He moves as fast as humanly possible

          She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her.
          
          
          Several LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She 
          shrinks in her seat at the attention. Charlie's oblivious.
          
          
          CORA
          
          
          Can't get over how grown up you 
          
          
          are. And so gorgeous. 
          
          
          Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak. 
          A 
          bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, 
          leaning over her shoulder to Bella 
          -
          
          
          
          15.
          WAYLON
          Member me, honey? I was Santa one year.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas 
          here since she was four.
          
          
          WAYLON
          Bet I made an impression, though. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You always do. 
          
          
          CORA
          Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon. 
          
          
          (to Bella)
          When you're done, I'll bring your 
          favorite - berry cobbler. Remember? 
          Your dad still has it. Every Thursday.
          
          
          BELLA
          (doesn't remember at
          all)
          That'd be great, thank you.
          
          
          Cora shoos Waylon away. Left alone now, Charlie and Bella 
          both reach for the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes for the 
          ketchup instead. Silence as they eat. 
          
          
          A burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to 
          emphasize their discomfort. Bella tries to bridge the gap.
          
          
          BELLA
          So... you eat here every night?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Easier than washing dishes.
          
          
          BELLA
          I can cook.
          
          
          He looks up, as if confused by the concept.
          
          
          BELLA
          I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. 
          Mom's not great in the kitchen.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I remember..
          . 
          
          
          They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          How was school? Meet anyone?
          
          
          
          16.
          BELLA
          A few people... Do you know the 
          Cullen family?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          (looks up sharply)
          Are people talking about them again?
          
          
          BELLA
          No... well, a little.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just cause they're newcomers. We're 
          lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. 
          Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky 
          his wife wanted to live in a small 
          town. Lucky his kids aren't like 
          a 
          lot of the hell-raisers around here.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Okay.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I just don't like narrow
          mindedness. 
          
          
          And he returns to his food. Silence. 
          
          
          25 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT 25
          
          
          Bella looks out at the fog as she talks on the phone. 
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          If spring training goes well, we could 
          be living in Florida permanently.

          BELLA
          Mom, where's your cell?
          
          
          INTERCUT WITH:
          
          
          26 EXT. GAS STATION/GARAGE - NIGHT 26
          
          
          Rene talks on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her hand. 
          In the b.g., Phil and an Attendant work on the Subaru engine. 
          
          
          RENE
          Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It 
          ran away. Screaming. I literally 
          repel technology now.
          
          
          
          17.
          Bella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone 
          quarters. 
          
          
          RENE
          
          
          Now, tell me more about your 
          
          
          school, baby. What are the kids 
          
          
          like? Are there any cute guys? 
          
          
          Are they being nice to you?
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (a beat, lying)
          
          
          They've all been really..
          . 
          
          
          welcoming.
          
          
          PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE, getting mad all over again as..
          .
          
          
          FLASH POP TO -EDWARD'S FACE, HIS COAL BLACK EYES, THE FURY..
          .
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          27 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL) 27
          
          
          ON BELLA, sitting atop a table, an open book in her lap. But her 
          eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull 
          in. She's waiting for Edward.
          
          
          Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball 
          nearby. They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, 
          declining... and returns to watching for Edward. Her face 
          tells us she's ready for a confrontation. 
          
          
          28 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - SAME DAY 28
          
          
          Bella strides in... but stops, surprised to find her lab 
          table empty. Off Bella, frustrated..
          .
          
          
          BEGIN A SERIES OF SCENES OVER SEVERAL DAYS:
          
          
          29 INT. CAFETERIA - DIFFERENT DAY 29
          
          
          Bella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video 
          on their phone. Bella gives it a cursory look, but is 
          focused on the Cullen table --only four of them. Edward's
          seat is empty..
          . 
          
          
          30 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DIFFERENT DAY 30
          
          
          Bella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled to 
          find Rosalie and Alice behind her. They study Bella, Rosalie 
          with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity. Bella, uneasy, 
          hurries out.
          
          
          31 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - DIFFERENT DAY 31
          
          
          Bella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part 
          of this circle. 
          
          
          
          18.
          She now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives
          past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to 
          her friends, finally forgetting about him..
          .
          
          
          SERIES OF SCENES ENDS as we go to 
          -
          32 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 32
          It's neater, rearranged more attractively. Clearly, Bella's
          given it her touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie's
          fleece jacket, straightening up. She grabs her book bag 
          -
          BELLA
          Dad, I'm heading out.
          33 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING 33
          ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay
          filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of
          puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight.
          BELLA
          Great. 
          WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her 
          truck. 
          BELLA
          Dad, I can drive myself to school.
          
          
          As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's 
          watching her -
          -
          UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES 
          --tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on 
          a
          
          
          patch of ice -
          -
          BACK ON BELLA - fallen on her ass. Charlie climbs out of the 
          truck, helps her up. 
          CHARLIE
          You okay, Bells?
          BELLA
          Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          That's why I got you new tires. 
          She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires.
          CHARLIE
          
          
          The other ones were nearly bald. 
          
          
          
          19.
          BELLA
          You got me new tires. No one's 
          ever done that before.
          
          
          Charlie looks at her, confused.
          
          
          BELLA
          I mean... nothing.
          
          
          He clearly doesn't get it as heads toward his Cruiser.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading 
          down to Mason County. A security guard 
          at the Grisham Mill got killed by some 
          kind of animal..
          .
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he speaks..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          An animal?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You're not in Phoenix any more, 
          honey. They've been hunting it for 
          a week with no luck. Thought I'd 
          lend a hand.
          
          
          BELLA
          Be careful.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Always am.
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA
          And thank you. For the tires.
          
          
          He sees emotion in her eyes. Doesn't understand it, but nods,
          heads inside. Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved..
          .
          
          
          34 OMITTED 34
          
          
          35 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS/HALLWAY - DAY 35
          
          
          Rain beats on the roof as Eric walks Bella into class. She 
          brushes water off her coat as he chats her up.
          
          
          ERIC
          ... and yeah, prom committee is 
          a 
          chick thing, but I gotta cover it 
          for the paper anyway, and they need 
          a guy to help choose the music -
          -
          So I need your play list 
          -
          
          
          
          20.
          Bella is about to respond when Mike comes up behind her.
          
          
          MIKE
          Come on, Arizona. Give it up for 
          the rain.
          
          
          And he shakes his wet baseball cap onto Bella's head.
          
          
          BELLA
          Terrific. 
          
          
          She heads toward her seat, brushing off her hair. But she 
          freezes when she sees --Edward. 
          
          
          Bella straightens, girding herself. Then strides to the 
          table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to address 
          him. But he looks up at her 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hello.
          
          
          Bella stops. Stunned. He is direct, precise, as if every 
          word is an effort for him. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I didn't have a chance to introduce 
          myself last week. My name is 
          Edward Cullen. 
          
          
          She's too shocked that he's talking to her to answer.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (prompting)
          ... You're Bella.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm... yes. 
          
          
          Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly moves to 
          the extreme edge of his seat. She's even more baffled now.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          
          
          (to the class)
          Onion root tip cells! That's 
          what's on your slides. Separate 
          and label them into the phases of 
          mitosis. The first partners to get 
          it right, win... the golden onion! 
          
          
          He excitedly holds up a spray painted onion. Everyone just 
          looks at him. He's disappointed by their apathy.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Come on, people. Tick tock.
          
          
          
          21.
          Everyone sets to work. Edward pushes the microscope to 
          Bella, keeping his distance, his voice controlled.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ladies first. 
          
          
          She grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide 
          in, adjusting the lens. She's curt as she addresses him.
          
          
          BELLA
          You've been gone.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Out of town. For personal reasons.
          
          
          She glances at him but he just leans far away, his face 
          tight. She looks back into the microscope.
          
          
          BELLA
          Prophase. 
          
          
          She begins to remove the slide. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          May I look?
          
          
          She slides him the microscope. He glances through the lens.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Prophase.
          
          
          BELLA
          (muttering)
          Like I said.
          
          
          He writes it on the worksheet. Then he takes a breath, as if 
          trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Enjoying the rain?
          
          
          BELLA
          Seriously? You're asking me about the 
          weather?
          
          
          EDWARD
          It appears.
          
          
          BELLA
          No. I don't like the cold. Or the 
          wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or 
          turtle necks. 
          
          
          Is that a smile playing on his lips? For the first time, he 
          seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She still 
          can't tell if he despises her or not. It's infuriating.
          
          
          
          22.
          BELLA
          
          
          What?
          
          
          He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out 
          
          
          the slides. She looks at him. And keeps looking..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - ECU ON EDWARD'S FACE
          
          
          His cheekbones, his lips. So perfect, like a sculpture..
          .
          EDWARD
          
          
          Anaphase. 
          She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look. 
          BELLA 
          May I? 
          
          (she looks through the 
          lens)
          Anaphase.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Like I said.
          
          
          She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk. She simply 
          holds out her hand for another slide.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (handing her the slide)
          If you hate cold and rain, why move to 
          the wettest place in the continental U.S.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's complicated.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I think I can keep up.
          
          
          He actually seems interested. She looks into the microscope as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          My mother remarried. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Very complex. So you don't like him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Phil is fine. Young for her, but 
          nice enough.
          
          
          (re: the slide)
          Interphase.
          
          
          CUT ON THE SCHOOL BELL:
          
          
          
          23.
          36 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 36
          
          
          Bella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs 
          into Edward, who's directly in front of her. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          Why didn't you stay with your mom 
          
          
          and stepdad?
          
          
          He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher 
          her. She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Alright, Phil's a minor league 
          
          
          baseball player, so he travels 
          a 
          
          
          lot. My mother stayed home with me 
          
          
          but it made her unhappy. So 
          I 
          
          
          decided to spend time with my 
          
          
          father.
          
          
          EDWARD
          But now you're unhappy. 
          
          
          BELLA
          No... I -- I just..
          .
          
          
          Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          I'm just trying to figure you out. 
          
          
          You're very hard to read.
          
          
          He's clearly trying to read her now... their eyes meet again.
          But now she looks more closely at him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Did you get contacts? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... no.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Your eyes were black before, now 
          
          
          they're this golden brown or 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's just the fluorescents.
          
          
          He abruptly turns and walks away. As he does, Bella notes -
          -
          HIS HANDS clenched into tight fists. Off Bella, utterly 
          bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated.
          
          
          37 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 37
          
          
          The rain has stopped, but the parking lot is full of water 
          and patches of black ice. 
          
          
          
          24.
          Shivering, Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion, 
          carefully navigating the icy puddles. As she reaches her 
          truck, she looks across the lot 
          
          
          EDWARD stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to 
          climb in. A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward the 
          sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER..
          . 
          
          
          Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out of 
          control, heading directly for her. TIME suddenly fractures, 
          compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as 
          -
          
          
          -- THE FACES OF THE STUDENTS - in shock, seeing what's coming.
          --THE VAN DRIVER'S FACE -TYLER, desperately trying to gain
          control, then shielding his face.
          -- EDWARD'S FACE - looking at Bella with horror..
          . 
          
          
          THE VAN is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in 
          between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning 
          her to the ground. She looks up - Edward is on top of her. 
          
          
          The world around them FREEZES -- in this fraction of 
          a 
          second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying. He 
          breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face..
          .
          
          
          Abruptly, we BLAST BACK TO SPEED as several things happen so 
          quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on:
          
          
          -- THE VAN SMASHES into the back of Bella's truck 
          -
          -- Then SPINS around, once again careening toward her and 
          Edward, then suddenly 
          -
          --EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a deep dent in the side of the
          van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella. 
          -- Edward literally pushes the van away.
          
          
          Then silence. A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at 
          Edward, trying to absorb what just happened. Edward's fear for
          her is still alive on his face. She starts to speak but..
          .
          
          
          THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help. People leap to 
          Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward. Bella SEES the onion on the
          ground, smashed as she would have been. As everyone sweeps in, 
          Edward moves into the b.g. Mike and Eric run to Bella 
          -
          
          
          MIKE ERIC
          
          
          Are you okay!? Are you What happened!? Did anyone 
          
          
          hurt?! see what happened?
          !
          
          
          Amid the chaos, Bella sees EDWARD'S SIBLINGS looking at
          Edward. But they show no hint of concern for his safety. 
          Instead, they look at him with disapproval... and fury. 
          
          
          38 INT. HOSPITAL - TREATMENT AREA - DAY 38
          
          
          The double doors BURST open as Charlie runs in, face white 
          with terror. He spots 
          -
          
          
          
          25.
          BELLA - sitting on a gurney, the E.R. DOCTOR looking into her 
          eyes with a pen light. On the next gurney over, Tyler, the 
          van's driver, lies with a mild head wound. Charlie rushes up.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bells. Are you alright?
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm fine, dad. Calm down.
          
          
          TYLER
          I'm so sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's okay, Tyler.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It sure as hell is not okay.
          
          
          BELLA
          Dad, it's not his fault-
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          (stern, cutting her off)
          We nearly lost you.
          
          
          BELLA
          But you didn't.
          
          
          He'd hug her, if that was who he, or who she was. Instead,
          he glares at Tyler.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You can kiss your license goodbye.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN (O.S.
          )
          I heard the Chief's daughter was here.
          
          
          They look up as DR. CARLISLE CULLEN, mid 30's, approaches, blond,
          movie star handsome. His face is kind, but pale, tired. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Good. Dr. Cullen. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (to E.R. Doctor)
          I've got this one, Jackie.
          
          
          The E.R. Doctor hands Dr. Cullen the chart, exits. Dr. Cullen 
          reviews her chart, then feels the back of her head as..
          .
          
          
          
          26.
          DR. CULLEN
          You have a nice knot growing back 
          there, but your x-rays show no 
          indication of concussion. 
          
          
          TYLER
          I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really 
          -
          
          
          Charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It would have been a lot worse if Edward 
          hadn't knocked me out of the way.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Edward? Your boy?
          
          
          Dr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart. Bella's 
          intuition flickers, sensing he knows something. She presses.
          
          
          BELLA
          It was amazing he got to me so 
          fast. He was nowhere near me.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (smiles)
          As long as you're safe. 
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - DAY 39
          
          
          Charlie and Bella exit the treatment area.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I just have to sign some paperwork. 
          You better call your mom.
          
          
          BELLA
          You told her?! She's probably freaking.
          
          
          He shrugs and hurries off. Bella shakes her head, pulls out her 
          cell phone. Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall..
          .
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN
          
          
          Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground. 
          Dr. Cullen plays intermediary. 
          
          
          ROSALIE
          This isn't just about you, it's about 
          all of us -
          -
          
          
          Dr. Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Let's take this in my office.
          
          
          
          27.
          Rosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr. Cullen. Edward 
          adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined.
          
          
          BELLA
          Can I talk to you for a moment?
          (off his nod)
          How did you get over to me so quickly? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I was standing right next to you.
          
          
          BELLA
          You were next to your car, across 
          the lot.
          
          
          He steps closer to her. His expression turns icy hard. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          No, I wasn't.
          
          
          She won't be bullied. Steps closer to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes. You were. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're confused. You hit your head. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I know what I saw.
          
          
          EDWARD
          And what, exactly, was that?
          
          
          BELLA
          You stopped that van. You pushed
          it away.
          
          
          EDWARD
          No one will believe that. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I wasn't planning to tell anyone. 
          
          
          This registers with Edward. They're inches from each other,
          the tension thick. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I just want to know the truth.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Can't you just thank me and get 
          over it?
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Thank you.
          
          
          
          28.
          A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and 
          without a doubt, attracted. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're not going to let it go, are you?
          
          
          BELLA
          No.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (turns, walks away)
          Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
          
          
          BELLA
          Why did you even bother?
          
          
          He stops, a beat. Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... I don't know.
          
          
          And he keeps walking. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly 
          attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          That was the first night I dreamed 
          of Edward Cullen..
          .
          
          
          40 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 40
          
          
          Bella swims, white skin aglow, hair floating weightlessly, 
          sensually... suddenly, something BLASTS past her. She spins. 
          It's gone. Something BLASTS behind her. She spins again -
          to find herself face to face with 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD ... Bella reaches for him, but he abruptly springs 
          backward, just out of reach. 
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          41 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - NIGHT 41
          
          
          -as she bolts up awake. In that split second, in the darkness, 
          she SEES Edward, watching her. She SNAPS on the light -- the 
          room is empty. Was she dreaming? 
          42 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 42
          
          
          Bella stands in the exact spot of the accident. Behind her 
          on the lawn, several CLASSES congregate, gathering for 
          a 
          field trip. Mr. Molina is in charge.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Make sure I get your permission slips.
          
          
          
          29.
          PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE staring at the skid marks on the
          pavement..
          .
          
          
          FLASH POP TO THE VAN REELING RIGHT FOR HER 
          -
          
          
          FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S HANDS STOPPING THE VAN 
          -
          
          
          FLASH POP TO EDWARD ON TOP OF HER, THE PROXIMITY, ELECTRICITY 
          -
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA, blushing at the memory. Then she SEES Edward 
          arrive with Alice and Jasper. She watches him, barely noticing as 
          Mike trots up to her -
          -
          
          
          MIKE 
          (ala Dr. Frankenstein)
          Look! You're moving. You're ALIVE!
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Yeah, false alarm..
          .
          
          
          MIKE
          Actually, I'm glad you're not dead 
          cause - well, that would suck, plus 
          I 
          wanted to ask you - even though it's, 
          like, a month away..
          .
          
          
          But Bella's distracted by Edward. Mike's VOICE DIPS as..
          .
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - ACROSS THE LAWN
          
          
          Edward, head down, is in quiet conference with Jasper and Alice. 
          Abruptly, he looks up, as if listening to her and Mike, though 
          he's too far away to hear. Bella quickly refocuses on Mike.
          
          
          MIKE
          So what do you think?
          (off her blank look)
          You want to go? To prom. With me.
          
          
          BELLA
          (realizing, horrified)
          Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go 
          
          
          -somewhere. To Jacksonville. Yeah.
          MIKE
          You can't go another weekend? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you 
          should ask Jessica. 
          
          
          Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lawn to Jessica.
          She smiles at them -- Suddenly Edward crosses in front of 
          Jessica. He seems to be smirking..
          .
          
          
          
          30.
          43 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GREENHOUSE - FIELD TRIP - DAY 43
          
          
          Mr. Molina and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through 
          the greenhouse. Bella keeps an eye on Edward who's up ahead
          with Alice and Jasper. Mr. Molina demonstrates the compost 
          machine as the students mess around. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          ...c'mon, Eric, stuff that compost 
          down deep... that's it..
          .
          (the machine gurgles and spins)
          ... now Tyler, take a big steaming 
          cup of compost tea. This is 
          recycling at its most basic level -
          -
          hey, don't drink that!
          
          
          When Bella sees Edward pause by an ancient staghorn fern, 
          alone, she takes a breath for courage and strides up to him. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Hello, Edward.
          
          
          He glances at her, merely nodding. We notice his FISTS clench, 
          and unclench. Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness.
          
          
          BELLA
          Really?
          
          
          No response. She turns, starts to walk away. 
          
          
          EDWARD 
          What's in Jacksonville?
          
          
          She turns back to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you know about that? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You didn't answer my question.
          
          
          BELLA
          You haven't answered any of mine. 
          You won't even say hello.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hello.
          
          
          BELLA
          And how did you stop that van?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Adrenaline rush. Very common. 
          Google it. 
          
          
          
          31.
          BELLA
          
          
          (not buying it)
          Floridians. That's what's in 
          Jacksonville.
          
          
          She turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation 
          hose. Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so 
          powerful... He clenches his jaw.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It helps if you actually watch
          where you put your feet.
          
          
          Insulted, she keeps moving. He keeps pace, serious now. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I know I've been rude, but it's for 
          the best.
          
          
          She just looks at him like he's crazy. He walks away as
          Jessica suddenly rushes up.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Guess who just asked me to prom!
          
          
          Bella smiles.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I totally thought Mike was going to 
          ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be 
          weird? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No way. Zero weirdness. You guys 
          are great together.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I know, right?
          
          
          Giddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela. Bella heads 
          out the door that leads to 
          -
          
          
          EXT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GREENHOUSE - THE BUSES (CONTINUOUS)44
          
          
          --where everyone's looking at the COMPOST WORM BOX, grossing
          each other out with the slimy creatures. As Bella backs away, 
          Edward steps up.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, it would be better if we 
          weren't friends. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (wounded)
          Too bad you didn't figure that out 
          earlier.

          32.
          BELLA (cont'd)
          You could have let the van crush me 
          and saved yourself all this regret.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (snapping, angry)
          You think I regret saving you?
          
          
          BELLA
          I know you do.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (furious)
          You don't know anything.
          
          
          His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at 
          Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity.
          
          
          ALICE
          The bus is leaving.
          (to Bella)
          Hi. Will you be riding with us?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No. Our bus is full.
          
          
          He purposefully walks Alice away. But he glances back at 
          Bella with, is that... remorse? She doesn't see it.
          
          
          INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 45
          
          
          Bella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry. 
          She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your mother called. Again.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your fault, for telling her about 
          the accident.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          She always did know how to worry. 
          
          
          (hint of sadness)
          But... she's changed, too. She 
          seems happy. Phil sounds all 
          right.
          
          
          BELLA
          He is.
          
          
          She continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO.
          Off Bella's FACE, we MATCH CUT -

          -- as she pushes through the doors. She glances over at the 
          CULLEN TABLE, Edward with his siblings. He doesn't look at her.
          Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, 
          Jessica, Mike and Angela. She drops her book bag on a seat 
          -
          
          
          ERIC
          La Push, baby. You in?
          
          
          BELLA
          Should I know what that means?
          
          
          MIKE
          La Push beach, down on the Quileute 
          rez. We're all going after school. 
          Big swell coming in. 
          
          
          ERIC
          And I don't just surf the internet.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Eric, you stood up once. On a foam 
          board.
          
          
          ANGELA
          There's whale watching, too. Come with. 
          
          
          ERIC
          La Push, baby.

          I'll go if you stop saying that. 
          
          
          47 THE SALAD BAR STATION - MINUTES LATER 47
          
          
          Bella artfully designs an architectural salad. As she 
          reaches for an APPLE, Edward is suddenly next to her 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD 
          (charmed)
          Edible art..
          .
          
          
          Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches 
          it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into 
          his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin. 
          He presents it to her with small smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          Thanks... but your mood swings are 
          giving me whiplash.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I said it would be better if we weren't 
          friends, not that I didn't want to be. 
          
          
          
          34.
          BELLA
          What does that even mean?
          
          
          EDWARD
          It means if you were smart, you'd 
          avoid me.
          
          
          Edward inadvertently glances at his four inhumanly beautiful 
          siblings, who wait for him, expectantly, at their table. 
          
          
          She notes her own, very human friends monitoring this 
          conversation from their table. Mike glowers jealously.
          
          
          BELLA
          So let's say, for argument's sake, 
          that I'm not smart. Would you talk 
          to me? Tell me the truth? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Probably not. I'd rather hear your 
          theories.
          
          
          BELLA
          Okay... how bout radioactive 
          spiders? Kryptonite?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (levels his gaze, 
          
          
          challenging)
          You're talking about superheroes. 
          What if I'm not a hero? What if 
          I'm a bad guy?
          
          
          BELLA
          (beat, looking closer at him)
          No. I don't believe that. You're 
          not bad. You can be a jerk, but 
          it's like this... mask. To keep 
          people away. 
          
          
          He's taken aback by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Look, why don't we just - hang out. 
          Like... come to the beach with us. 
          It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, 
          salt water stinging your eyes..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          (small smile, considering 
          it)
          Which beach?
          
          
          BELLA
          La Push. 
          
          
          
          35.
          His smile lessens almost imperceptibly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Is something wrong with that beach?
          
          
          Edward glances over at Mike - the two exchange cold looks.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's just a little crowded.
          
          
          Off Bella, as Edward walks away..
          .
          
          
          48 EXT. LA PUSH BEACH - DAY 48
          
          
          It's freezing, but Mike, Tyler, Jessica and others suit up
          for a surf. Eric hangs with them. Bella wanders by the 
          driftwood with Angela, who takes photographs. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me 
          to prom, then he just... doesn't.
          
          
          BELLA
          You could ask him. 
          (off Angela's flustered 
          
          
          look)
          Take control. You're a strong 
          independent woman.
          
          
          ANGELA
          I am?
          
          
          JACOB (O.S.
          )
          Bella!
          
          
          She looks up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; 
          Jacob Black, and SAM and EMBRY. Bella smiles at Jacob. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Guys, this is Jacob. Are you 
          stalking me?
          
          
          JACOB
          You're on my rez, remember? You 
          surfing?
          
          
          BELLA
          Definitely not. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          (teasing)
          Keep her company. Her date bailed. 
          
          
          ERIC
          What date?
          
          
          
          36.
          JESSICA
          She invited Edward. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (embarrassed)
          To be polite.
          
          
          ANGELA
          I think it's nice she invited him. 
          No one ever does.
          
          
          MIKE
          Because Cullen's a freak.
          
          
          SAM
          You got that right.
          
          
          BELLA
          You know them?
          
          
          SAM
          (sharply)
          The Cullens don't come here.
          
          
          Jacob shoots Sam a look, shakes his head. Bella registers this. 
          A beat, then she casually pulls Jacob aside 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          You want to go look at tide pools?
          
          
          She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile. He grins, 
          infatuated. As they head toward the water..
          .
          
          
          EXT. LA PUSH BEACH - LATER DAY 49
          
          
          Bella and Jacob wander near the water, looking out to sea for 
          whales. The surfers are out on the waves. She nudges him, 
          continuing her attempt at flirtation..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          So, what did your friend mean about 
          the Cullens not coming here?
          
          
          JACOB
          Oops. Caught that, huh? 
          
          
          He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy. 
          
          
          JACOB
          I'm not supposed to say anything.
          
          
          Bella gives him her best alluring smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          I can keep a secret..
          .
          
          
          
          37.
          JACOB
          
          
           (laughing) 
          It's just an old scary story. Did 
          you know the Quileutes are 
          supposedly descended from wolves?
          
          
          BELLA
          Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?
          
          
          Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to continue..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          So the legend about the Cullens is..
          .
          
          
          JACOB
          Well, they're supposedly descended 
          from this, like..
          .
          
          
           (in a spooky voice)
          
          
          enemy clan. ... But they 
          claimed to be different, so we made 
          a treaty with them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Didn't they just move here?
          
          
          JACOB
          Or just moved back.
          
          
          BELLA
          Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
          
          
          JACOB
          
          
           (whispering)
          If they promised to stay off Quileute 
          lands, we wouldn't expose what they 
          really were to the pale-faces..
          . 
          
          
          Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. 
          
          
          GIRL (O.S)
          AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!
          !
          
          
          Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, 
          chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean. Jacob smirks and 
          starts back to the group.
          
          
          BELLA
          Wait... what were they really? 
          
          
          JACOB 
          (laughing)
          It's just a story, Bella.
          
          
          Off Bella, with more unanswered questions..
          .
          
          
          
          38.
          50 EXT. SHACK COMMUNITY ON THE RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON 50
          
          
          A collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by 
          wood plank sidewalks. FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger 
          who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, 
          swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman. 
          
          
          His old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and 
          river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his Walkman..
          . 
          
          
          Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves. The 
          dog raises his head, starts to GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice.
          
          
          STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he looks up and 
          realizes the dog's gone.
          
          
          WAYLON
          Jerry?
          
          
          Waylon pulls off the headphones. WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon 
          walks up a walkway... then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from 
          under a bush. 
          
          
          WAYLON
          Come on, Jerry, you old mutt..
          .
          
          
          He pulls at the leg. It's detached. He reels back, stumbling 
          onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out 
          -
          
          
          ON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely. 
          
          
          WAYLON'S POV -ON THE WOODS lining the river. Ominous
          darkness. A NOISE. He jerks around. Nothing. Then 
          suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins 
          -
          
          
          A MAN - now stands on the bow. JAMES, 30, pale white. 
          A 
          vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, 
          sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike 
          movements are always on the edge of a crouch.
          
          
          WAYLON
          H-how did you do that?
          
          
          JAMES
          Always the same inane questions..
          .
          
          
          Waylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA,
          26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods. 
          Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy 
          black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat. All three 
          Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot.
          
          
          JAMES
          What do you want?
          
          
          
          
          39.
          VICTORIA
          Why are you doing this?
           
          
          
          LAURENT
          (sighs, slight French 
          accent)
          ... James, must we?
          
          
          JAMES
          The question should be, will it hurt?
          
          
          
          Victoria grins sadistically. Then with lightening fast 
          speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO BLACK:
          
          
          51 FADE IN ON EDWARD'S FACE AGAINST BLACKNESS 51
          
          
          SNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips..
          .
          
          
          52 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON HER FACE - MORNING 52
          
          
          As she sits in front of her computer, lost in thought. She 
          shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine 
          Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula. An AD pops up,
          Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles. Bella,
          intrigued, clicks on it..
          . 
          
          
          53 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - SUNNY DAY 53
          
          
          The sun has come out and so has the skin. Kids are in shorts 
          though it's still barely sixty degrees. Everyone eats lunch 
          outdoors. Bella searches the crowd for Edward.
          
          
          JESSICA (O.S.
          )
          He's not here.
          
          
          She looks down to find Jessica sitting on the grass.
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          Whenever the weather's nice, the 
          
          
          Cullens disappear. 
          
          
          BELLA
          They just... ditch?
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank em 
          
          
          out for hiking and camping and 
          
          
          stuff. I tried the idea out on my 
          
          
          parents. Not even close. 
          
          
          Bella registers this as Angela suddenly jumps on them.
          
          
          
          40.
          ANGELA
          I'm going to the prom with Eric! 
          I 
          just asked him, I took control! 
          
          
          (hugs Bella)
          Are you sure you have to go out of town?
          
          
          BELLA
          It's a family thing.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Oh my God, we need to hit the 
          stores in Port Angeles before the 
          dresses get cleaned out. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Port Angeles?..
          . 
          (a plan forming in her 
          mind)
          Can I go with you guys? 
          
          
          ANGELA
          Thank God. We need your opinion.
          
          
          Off Bella, that's not really what she had in mind..

          54 INT. BOUTIQUE, PORT ANGELES -ON BELLA'S FACE- AFTERNOON 54
          
          
          -- antsy, distracted, as Jessica and Angela try on dresses. 
          Bella pulls a Mapquest print-out from her purse -- it reads, 
          Thunderbird and Whale Book Store. Jessica flounces out of
          the changing room, posing provocatively.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I think this halter makes my boobs 
          look big. What do you think, 
          Bella?
          
          
          Outside the window, a group of rowdy FRAT BOYS head toward 
          a 
          bar. Two of them stare at Jessica in her low-cut dress. 
          Embarrassed, she turns back to Bella. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          Bella?
          
          
          BELLA
          (absently)
          It looks great. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          You said that about the last five 
          dresses.
          
          
          ANGELA 
          (empathetic)
          You're not very good at this, are you?
          
          
          
          41.
          BELLA
          
          
          Maybe I should just go check out the 
          
          
          book store and meet you at the 
          
          
          restaurant later.
          
          
          ANGELA
          You sure?
          
          
          Bella nods, heads out. Jessica's looks in the mirror again.
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          She was right about this halter, 
          
          
          though. It does look great.

          Bella exits, thumbing through a BOOK she just bought. She 
          heads down the sidewalk, but then hears FOOTSTEPS behind her. 
          She turns, doesn't see anyone. She puts the book in her
          shoulder bag and continues.
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA -someone's following her. She looks 
          around, changing course to cut across a parking lot. Unknown

          TWO MEN emerge from the shadows, not vampires, but the Frat 
          Boys, really wasted now.

          Wanna beer?
          
          
          She looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there. She's
          cornered. She takes her purse from around her shoulder.
          
          
          BELLA
          Look, just take my bag.
          
          
          FRAT BOY #
          2
          We don't want your bag.
          
          
          She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her 
          wrist to use her purse as a mace. They chortle derisively. 
          But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in 
          the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other 
          three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly 
          -
          
          

          HEADLIGHTS blind them. A silver Volvo screeches up. The 
          Frat Boys dive out of the way. The passenger-side door 
          opens. It's Edward. She's too stunned to even move.
          
          
          
          42.
          EDWARD
          Get in.
          
          
          She finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and 
          rushes Edward's side of the car 
          -
          
          
          Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing 
          Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it. 
          Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic
          in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. 
          As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.
          
          
          59 INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 59
          
          
          Bella continues to stare. She sees that he's seething with anger,
          hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched.
          
          
          BELLA
          What -- no, how did you find -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (through gritted teeth)
          I should go back and rip their heads off.
          
          
          BELLA
          No. Bad idea. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You don't know the vile, repulsive 
          things they were thinking.
          
          
          BELLA
          And you do?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (covering)
          Not hard to guess. 
          
          
          60 EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 60
          
          
          Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches.
          
          
          ANGELA
          Where were you!? We left you a message.
          
          
          JESSICA
          We waited, but we were starving 
          -
          
          
          Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car. 
          They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort to be
          charming. And they are charmed.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We 
          ran into each other and got talking. 
          
          
          
          43.
          JESSICA
          I - we - understand. We were 
          just... leaving, so 
          -
          
          
          The two girls start to go. Bella is forced to go with them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Okay, well. Thank you.
          
          
          She starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (abruptly)
          Maybe I should make sure Bella gets 
          something to eat.
          
          
          (off Bella's surprised 
          
          
          look)
          ... If you'd like. Then I could 
          drive you back myself.
          
          
          ANGELA
          That's so... thoughtful.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Really thoughtful.
          
          
          BELLA
          (debates, then decides)
          I could eat.
          
          
          As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and 
          a 
          noiseless scream of excitement. 
          
          
          EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - DINING PATIO - NIGHT 61
          
          
          Bella and Edward sit on the deck. A dramatic waterfall 
          shimmers behind them.
          
          
          A waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon 
          in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward. She exits.
          
          
          BELLA
          You're not eating?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm on a special diet.
          
          
          BELLA
          Like South Beach?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not exactly.
          
          
          She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite.
          
          
          
          44.
          BELLA
          So how bout some answers?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Yes, no. To get to the other side, 
          and 1 point 772453851.
          
          
          BELLA
          I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You knew that?
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you know where I was? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I didn't.
          
          
          She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside -
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          (stops her, sincerely)
          Don't go.
          
          
          He seems torn by some internal dilemma. Then finally..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Were you following me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I feel very protective of you. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So that's a yes?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Yes, I followed you. I tried to 
          keep my distance...until you needed 
          help.
          
          
          BELLA
          (putting everything together)
          You said before... That you heard 
          what those guys were thinking..
          . 
          Can you... read minds?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (shrugs)
          I'm thinking of getting a nine-
          hundred number.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (trying to grasp)
          Alright, so you read minds... What am 
          I thinking? Wait -- okay now, go.
          
          
          
          45.
          EDWARD
          I have no idea. I can read every 
          mind in there, except yours. 
          
          
          (points at people 
          inside)
          Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend 
          -
          (points at Bella)
          Nothing. It's quite frustrating. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Why, what's wrong with me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I tell you I read minds and you think 
          there's something wrong with you?
          
          
          He smiles, charmed by her. But his smile fades, that torn 
          look returns. He holds onto the rail, looking out. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What is it?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I... don't have the strength to 
          stay away from you anymore. 
          
          
          She's surprised. And thrilled.
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward, you don't have to.
          
          
          He's drawn in by her encouraging gaze... but he closes his
          eyes a beat, and turns back to the water.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (almost to himself)
          This is wrong. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're cold. We should go.
          
          
          He walks away before she can ask any more questions..
          .
          
          
          62 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 62
          
          
          Edward's Volvo speeds along the two lane highway.
          
          
          63 INT. EDWARD'S VOLVO - NIGHT 63
          
          
          Bella glances at Edward, might ask him more questions but he seems 
          to be wrestling with his own thoughts. Finally..
          . 
          
          
          
          46.
          BELLA
          I think I'm warm enough now. 
          
          
          She reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their 
          hands TOUCH. And hold a moment too long. An electric 
          current connecting them.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your hand, it's still freezing cold.
          
          
          He pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it... then 
          her attention shifts outside to FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS. As 
          they drive past the FORKS POLICE STATION, a sheriff's car
          pulls away. Charlie's cruiser is parked out front. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (concerned)
          Dad's here late. Something must 
          have happened.
          
          
          EXT./INT. FORKS - POLICE STATION (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 64
          
          
          The Volvo pulls up. Bella and Edward climb out. Edward then 
          sees a second car next to the cruiser. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          That's my father's car. What's he -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD AND BELLA'S POV: INSIDE THE DARKENED POLICE STATION
          
          
          In a pool of light, a distressed Charlie and Dr. Cullen study 
          photographs and evidence. As they wrap up their discussion, 
          Dr. Cullen puts a sympathetic hand on Charlie's shoulder,
          then exits the police station looking grim. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Carlisle. What happened?
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Waylon Forge was found in the woods 
          out near his place. I just 
          examined the body.
          
          
          Edward darkens. Bella is horrified.
          
          
          BELLA
          He died? How? 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Animal attack. 
          
          
          BELLA
          The same kind that killed the security 
          guard down in Mason?
          
          
          Edward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it.
          
          
          
          47.
          DR. CULLEN
          Most likely.
          
          
          BELLA
          So it's getting closer to town.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Waylon lived all the way down on 
          Queets River. 75 miles south.
          
          
          BELLA
          But that's 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (with a kind, reassuring 
          
          
          smile)
          Bella, you should go inside. 
          Waylon was your father's friend.
          
          
          She goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring 
          quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this.
          
          
          65 INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 65
          
          
          Bella enters to find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, 
          photos, maps --trying to make sense of Waylon's death.
          Deputies come and go in the background. Bella approaches 
          Charlie. He looks up.
          
          
          BELLA
          Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Known him going on thirty years. 
          
          
          He's obviously torn up. Bella isn't quite sure what to do.
          And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. A beat..
          . 
          
          
          Then Charlie squeezes her hand. It's the first physical
          affection we've seen between them. And it threatens to evoke
          even more emotion in Charlie. So he tamps it down, and rises, 
          then projects a confident manner. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. 
          But in the meantime..
          .
          
          
          As an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds 
          out a cannister of PEPPER SPRAY. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          ... I want you to have this.
          
          
          BELLA
          That's probably not a good 
          -
          
          
          
          48.
          CHARLIE
          It'll give me some peace of mind. 
          
          
          She sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her 
          purse. 
          
          
          As Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to SEE 
          -
          
          
          A66 EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - BELLA'S POV A66
          
          
          Two Attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance. On it, 
          Waylon's dead, white, bloody bare FEET peek out from under 
          a
          sheet, resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle. Off Bella, 
          chilled..
          .

          -- as she turns on the LIGHT. She hears a SNAP! outside the 
          window. She rises, digs into her purse for the PEPPER SPRAY 
          Charlie gave her, and goes to the window. She looks out -
          -
          all she sees is the wind blowing hard. But she's rattled.
          
          
          She closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought 
          earlier. She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within 
          reach. 
          
          
          INSERT THE BOOK, QUILEUTE FOLK STORIES AND ART.
          
          
          
          As she leafs through we see PHOTOS of ancient, carved MASKS. 
          Comical, menacing, haunting... then she stops on a photo of 
          a 
          white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth. THE 
          INSCRIPTION reads, The Cold One.
          
          
          
          Bella quickly goes to her computer and Googles Cold One  -
          several beer ads appear. Frustrated, she closes the pop-ups, 
          revealing a link to: The Cold One: Apotamkin -
          -
          
          
          INTERCUT BETWEEN BELLA AND THE COMPUTER SCREEN
          
          
          Several PICTURES begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his 
          ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, 
          paintings. Creatures beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal 
          demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring 
          innocent maidens... it's all murder, blood, sexuality.
          
          
          THEN SEVERAL WORDS LEAP OUT in quick succession: 
          
          
          
          49.
          -- Speed. Strength. Cold skinned. Immortal... 
           
          Then finally: Blood drinker.
           
          
          
          And we LAND ON A PICTURE OF A HANDSOME MAN BITING A WOMAN'S
          WHITE NECK..

          BACK ON BELLA - she reels back from the computer in utter 
          disbelief.
          BELLA
          ... it's not possible..

          Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all..

          She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn. Her 
          expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief. STAY 
          ON HER FACE, TIME LAPSING AS: 
          
          
          The bell rings and students exit class, rushing past Bella as 
          she stands still, waiting..

          BELLA'S POV - EDWARD AND HIS SIBLINGS
          -- cross the lawn, heading to class. Edward sees Bella, sees 
          the intensity on her face. He stops. 
          
          
          She walks to him, eyes meeting his... her look says, we have 
          to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the dark 
          forest that borders the school. 
          
          
          He watches her disappear in the trees, then takes a step to 
          follow. Jasper moves in front of him, Rosalie grabs his arm. 
          ROSALIE
          Edward, don't go.
          But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm.
          ALICE
          He's already there.
          
          
          68 
          EXT. FOREST - DAY 68
          Bella stands amid the trees, waiting. Then the SOUNDS OF THE 
          FOREST abruptly drop out. A predator is near. Edward 
          appears behind her. She doesn't turn around. A beat.
          
          
          
          50.
          BELLA
          You're impossibly fast. And strong. 
          Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. 
          Your eyes change color. And 
          sometimes you speak like... you're 
          from a different time. 
          
          
          (turns to face him now)
          You never eat food, or drink, or 
          come out in the sunlight. And you 
          said no to the beach trip only after 
          you heard where it was. Because of 
          the treaty. 
          
          
          This last registers with him. She steps closer to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          How old are you?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Seventeen.
          
          
          BELLA
          How long have you been seventeen?
          
          
          A long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM. He sees he can't hide
          anymore. Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... A while.
          
          
          She inhales. She knew, but it's still shocking. We CIRCLE
          THEM FASTER 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          I know what the Cold Ones are. 
          What you are. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Say it. Out loud. Say it.
          
          
          All sound suddenly DROPS OUT. We hear only her whisper..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Vampire
          
          
          They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her 
          reality utterly rocked. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. 
          
          
          
          51.
          EDWARD
          
          
          (angry)
          Then ask me the most basic 
          question: what do we eat?
          
          
          BELLA
          You won't hurt me. You're different.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You think you know me?
          
          
          He glares at her. She holds her ground. Suddenly, he takes 
          her by the hand. Starts walking. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Where are we going?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Up the mountain. Out of the cloud 
          bank. You need to see what 
          I 
          really am. What I look like in the 
          harsh light of the sun. 
          
          
          BELLA
          No! The sunlight will kill you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Myth. You need to see the truth.
          
          
          He pulls her but she stumbles. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Slow down.
          
          
          Suddenly, he's right next to her.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Then come with me. Someplace where 
          no one can protect you. Where 
          I 
          could do what I've wanted to do from 
          the first moment I met you. 
          
          
          Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm not afraid.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          You should be.
          
          
          
          52.
          He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hold on.
          
          
          Then he flings her onto his back... and starts running.
          
          
          69 EXT. FOREST - RUNNING - DAY 69
          
          
          As in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark 
          trunks STROBING past as he picks up speed, faster and faster. 
          Bella clings to his back as it seems he'll collide with the trees, 
          but he avoids them with supernatural grace. It's frightening, 
          nauseating, intoxicating. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid!
          ?
          
          
          BELLA
          No!
          
          
          But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. 
          Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead 
          -
          
          
          THE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond. The
          sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to 
          emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly-
          
          
          Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree. 
          All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium. 
          Then she realizes she's alone. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward? Where are you?
          
          
          She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into 
          -
          
          
          70 EXT. A MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 70
          
          
          A perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery 
          sunlight. HEAR a stream nearby. Bella looks around and finally 
          sees 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some 
          trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward 
          him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes 
          a 
          deep breath, and steps out of the shade 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          This is why we don't show ourselves 
          
          
          in sunlight..
          . 
          
          
          As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if 
          embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent, 
          shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He 
          moves toward her. 
          
          
          
          53.
          EDWARD
          This is what I am.
          
          
          He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA
          You're... beautiful..
          .
          
          
          He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but 
          he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (appalled)
          Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. 
          This is the skin of a killer. 
          
          
          His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.
          
          
          BELLA
          I don't believe that.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Because you believe the lie. The 
          camouflage. I'm the world's most 
          dangerous predator. Everything 
          about me invites you in - my voice, 
          my face, even my smell. As if 
          I 
          need any of that..
          .
          
          
          He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by 
          a
          tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          As if you could outrun me. As if 
          you could fight me off.
          
          
          He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against 
          a 
          tree trunk with explosive force. 
          
          
          Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm designed to kill.
          
          
          BELLA
          I don't care.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I've killed people.
          
          
          BELLA
          It doesn't matter.
          
          
          
          54.
          EDWARD
          I wanted to kill you. I've never
          wanted a human's blood so much in 
          my life. I'm dangerous to you.
          
          
          BELLA
          I trust you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Don't.
          
          
          BELLA
          I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
          
          
          She takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch. 
          She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is 
          nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone.
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward?
          
          
          She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, 
          catching his breath.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You... took me by surprise. 
          (collecting himself)
          I don't know how to... do this.
          
          
          He moves back toward her. Slowly. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Me, and my family, we're different 
          from others of our kind. We're not 
          nomadic, we have a permanent home. 
          We only hunt animals. We've 
          learned to control our thirst..
          . 
          
          
          (shaking his head)
          But you - your scent, it's like 
          a 
          drug to me... my own personal brand 
          of heroin. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (realizing)
          Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I did. For making me want you so badly. 
          I'm still not sure I can control myself.
          
          
          He reaches her again.
          
          
          BELLA
          I know you can.
          
          
          
          55.
          He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her
          face for clues.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I wish I could understand this 
          thing you see in me. You look at 
          me with those eyes..
          . 
          
          
          (frustrated)
          I can't read your mind. Tell me 
          what you're thinking.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm afraid.
          
          
          Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (devastated)
          Good. 
          
          
          She sinks down in front of him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll 
          disappear. That I'll lose you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (amazed, elated)
          You don't know how long I've looked 
          for you.
          
          
          They share a smile. Then he reaches toward her neck, 
          pausing..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          Be very still.
          
          
          She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand on 
          her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush
          between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move.
          
          
          He brushes his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to her 
          heart... Clouds float past the sun..
          .
          
          
          They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.
          
          
          EDWARD
          And so the lion fell for the lamb.
          
          
          BELLA
          Stupid lamb.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Sick masochistic lion.
          
          
          
          56.
          CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as 
          they dare... his hand to her heart..
          .
          
          
          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          71 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING 71
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA'S FACE. Still in bed. Thinking.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          About three things I was absolutely 
          positive. One, Edward was 
          a 
          vampire. 
          
          
          She rises, goes to the mirror. Looks at herself, worry 
          knitting her brow.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Two, there was a part of him that 
          thirsted for my blood. And three..
          .
          
          
          As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing 
          her to BANG into her desk. She looks back out..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY
          
          
          Edward leans against his car, looking up at her with a small 
          smile. She beams at the sight of him. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          ... I was falling, unconditionally 
          and irrevocably, in love with him.

          73 EXT. OLYMPIC RAINFOREST - DAY (ANOTHER DAY) 73
          
          
          Edward helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous fallen pine 
          tree in the moss-covered forest. 
          
          
          BELLA
          How long have you been like this?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Since nineteen-eighteen. That's 
          when Carlisle found me. 
          
          
          She takes that in, it's a lot. But it stokes her curiosity.
          
          
          BELLA
          Where'd he find you?
          
          
          EDWARD
          In a hospital, dying of Spanish 
          influenza. My parents had already died. 
          
          
          
          57.
          FLASHBACK to CHICAGO HOSPITAL, 1918 - NIGHT
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          What was it like?
          
          
          EDWARD (V.O.
          )
          The word excruciating comes to 
          mind. But what Carlisle did was 
          much harder... not many of us have 
          the restraint to do that. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Didn't he just... bite?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not just. Our bite contains venom. 
          And once we taste blood, a sort of..
          . 
          frenzy begins. It's almost 
          impossible to stop. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          But Carlisle did. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          First with me, then with his wife, 
          Esme. He found her in a hospital, 
          as well. The others followed.
          
          
          BACK to PRESENT DAY
          
          
          BELLA 
          Does someone have to be dying to 
          become like you?..
          .
          
          
          Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to 
          -
          
          
          74 EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - DAY (ANOTHER DAY) 74
          
          
          They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, 
          covered in bright green moss.
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... No, that's just Carlisle. He 
          would never do... this, to someone 
          who had another choice. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So Carlisle's the reason why you 
          hunt animals, instead of people. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not the only reason.
          
          
          He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion..
          .
          
          
          
          58.
          EDWARD
          I don't want to be a monster.
          
          
          She nods. Understands. He smiles.
          
          
          EDWARD
          We call ourselves vegetarians, by 
          the way... For our kind, hunting 
          animals is like living on tofu. It 
          keeps you strong but isn't very 
          satisfying. 
          
          
          Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing 
          on a large rock in the river.
          
          
          BELLA
          Show off.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's not that impressive, really. 
          Anyone in my family can do this.
          
          
          BELLA
          Can they all read minds, too? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          No, that's unique to me. But Alice can 
          see the future. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (fishing)
          Really? Bet she saw me coming 
          a 
          mile away.
          
          
          She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Her visions are very subjective. 
          The future can change.
          
          
          He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and 
          continuing their walk..
          .
          
          
          75 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT (ANOTHER DAY) 75
          
          
          Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck. 
          A boom box PLAYS. He perches on top of the roof. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Come to my house tomorrow. 
          
          
          Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off 
          the cab and sprays in her face. He jumps down from the roof.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your house? With your family?
          
          
          
          59.
          He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it 
          and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the 
          truck's body. She's too flustered to register it.
          
          
          BELLA 
          But... what if they don't like me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (laughing heartily)
          You're worried, not because you'll 
          be in a houseful of vampires, but 
          because you think they won't 
          approve of you? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm glad I amuse you.
          
          
          But then his laughter dies, as he hears something. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What is it?
          
          
          EDWARD
          A complication.
          
          
          ... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll pick you up tomorrow.
          
          
          He heads to his car, eying the passengers in 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD'S POV - INT. BLACK CAR
          
          
          Jacob, with his father, Billy, who's expression is intense.
          Anxious. SLOW MOTION as Edward locks eyes with Billy. Jacob 
          looks questioningly at his father.
          
          
          Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange. She 
          forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors. Jacob sets up 
          Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          Come to visit your truck?
          
          
          JACOB
          Looks good. You got that dent out. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Actually, we came to visit your 
          flat screen. First Mariners game 
          of the season. Plus Jacob here 
          kept bugging me to see you again.
          
          
          
          60.
          JACOB
          (mortified)
          Great, Dad. Thanks. 
          
          
          Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE 
          CRUISER pulls up. Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Pale Ale.
          
          
          BILLY
          (holds up a brown paper 
          BAG)
          Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
          
          
          Charlie smiles, pleased. He clicks on the game as they all head 
          inside 
          -
          
          
          BILLY
          Any luck with the Waylon case?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          (darkening)
          Found a footprint out at the crime 
          scene today. A bare, human footprint. 
          
          
          Billy seems disturbed but not surprised. Bella is horrified.
          
          
          BELLA
          A person did that?
          
          
          JACOB
          A crazy person, walking around 
          barefoot this time of year.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Spread the word out at the rez, will 
          ya? Keep the kids out of the woods. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Will do. 
          (directed at Bella)
          Don't want no one else getting hurt.
          
          
          Bella looks away from Billy, unnerved.

          Bella floats near Edward, only their hands touching, but 
          their bodies are nearing, so close, so sensual..

          Suddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD! Something has him, 
          pulling him down..

          SMASH TO:

          realizes it was just a dream. But it haunts her..

          AERIAL SHOT of the forest as we sweep over its lush green 
          expanse, to FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast. 
          The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long 
          
          
          serpentine dirt road. FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it 
          reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits 
          -
          
          
          81 
          EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - DAY 81
          A timeless graceful house. The Volvo pulls up and Bella 
          climbs out, surprised.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's... wonderful.
          EDWARD
          You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? 
          BELLA
          No... not moats.
          He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.

          INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 82
          Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house. Walls of glass 
          look out on the river. Everything's open and white. Historical
          objects are tastefully placed throughout. 
          
          
          HEAR Verdi's La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici coming from
          another room. Bella is enraptured.
          BELLA
          It's so light and open. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one 
          place we never have to hide.
          
          
          We then notice CLANGING coming from the kitchen. Edward 
          shakes his head.
          EDWARD
          I told them not to do this.

          Verdi's opera BLASTS Bella and Edward who enter to find the
          kitchen in full swing. Dr. Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and ESME 
          prepare elaborate platters of Italian pastas and antipasti. 
          
          
          Esme rolls out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an 
          instant. Rosalie stirs a pot, disinterested. 
          
          
          Esme sees Bella and stops, emanating maternal warmth. Her 
          heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the 
          silent-movie era. 
          
          
          ESME
          
          
          Bella. We're making Italiano for 
          
          
          you. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          This is Esme, my mother for all 
          
          
          intents and purposes. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Bon giorno?
          
          
          ESME
          Molto bene! 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
          You've given us an excuse to use 
          
          
          the kitchen for the first time. 
          
          
          Hit pause..
          .
          
          
          PAN across brand new Williams-Sonoma cookware boxes to the 
          corner --they're watching an ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a TV.
          Emmett hits the DVD remote control. 
          
          
          ESME
          I hope you're hungry.
          
          
          BELLA
          Oh, absolutely 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          She already ate.
          
          
          Bella shoots him a look, but something SHATTERS. Rosalie has 
          thrown down a bowl and now strides out 
          -
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Perfect.

          -- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain. The 
          other's follow -
          
          BELLA
          I just assumed -- because you don't 
          eat, you know..
          .
          
          
          ESME
          Of course. That was very considerate 
          of you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (re: Rosalie)
          Ignore her. I do.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Yes, let's keep pretending this 
          isn't dangerous for all of us. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I would never, ever tell anyone.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (reassuring)
          She knows that. 
          
          
          EMMETT
          The problem is, you two have gone 
          public now, so..
          .
          
          
          ESME
          
          
          Emmett.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          No, she should know.
          
          
          (to Bella)
          The entire family will be 
          implicated if this ends badly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Badly?
          
          
          This hangs in the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at her.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (realizing)
          Oh. Badly. Like, where I become 
          a 
          meal.
          
          
          Emmett chokes back laughter. Edward grins. Wraps his arm 
          around Bella. Even Esme has to chuckle.
          
          
          Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen. Emmett 
          shrugs, goes after her.
          
          
          
          64.
          ALICE (O.S.
          )
          Hi, Bella!
          
          
          ON THE BALCONY Alice leaps over the rail, holding a bouquet 
          of wildflowers. Jasper follows her. She bounces forward to 
          kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers. 
          
          
          ALICE
          
          
          I'm Alice. You do smell good. 
          EDWARD 
          Alice. 
          ALICE 
          
          It's alright, Bella and I are going 
          to be great friends. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (extending her hand)
          And you're Jasper, right?
          
          
          JASPER
          Pleasure to meet you.
          
          
          But he shies away from her hand. 
          
          
          ALICE
          (gently encouraging)
          You won't hurt her, Jasper.
          
          
          He isn't so sure. Edward takes Bella's hand instead.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll give you a tour of the house. 
          
          
          ALICE
          (with meaning)
          I'll see you soon.
          
          
          Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides 
          her up the stairs. As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic 
          ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden 
          China, Asian scrolls. They reach 
          -
          
          
          THE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed 
          silk squares with tassels. Bella looks closer. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Graduation caps?
          
          
          EDWARD
          A private joke. We matriculate a lot.
          
          
          BELLA
          What a nightmare, repeating high school. 
          
          
          
          65.
          EDWARD
          True, but the younger we start out in 
          a 
          new place, the longer we can stay there.
          
          
          She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on..

          EDWARD
          ... and this is my room.
          
          
          Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with 
          the river beyond. The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, 
          8
          track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So you're obsessed with music. But..
          .
          (looking around)
          No bed?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No sleep.
          
          
          BELLA
          Ever?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No nightmares, no drool, no 
          snoring.
          
          
          She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's,
          studying the titles.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Do you have any favorites?
          
          
          BELLA
          Depends. Alternative? Jazz? 
          Sixties, seventies..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, 
          nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'd have to say... Debussy.
          
          
          He looks at her, surprised, smiles. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          My favorite, too. 
          
          
          Off their connection, he pulls out a CD and puts it on. 
          A 
          solo piano version of CLAIR DE LUNE begins to play.
          
          
          
          66.
          He moves to her, taking her hand, then he starts to turn her 
          in a pirouette, dancing with her - but she breaks off and 
          backs away.
          
          
          BELLA
          No dancing.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ever? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No tripping, no falling, no derision. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          (mischievously)
          I can always make you.
          
          
          BELLA
          You don't scare me.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You really shouldn't have said that.
          
          
          He grins, a low GROWLING SOUNDS in the back of his throat. 
          She laughs and backs out the door, onto 
          -
          
          
          86 EXT. EDWARD'S ROOM - DECK (CONTINUOUS) 86
          
          
          -- Bella backs up to the rail. Edward appears in the 
          doorway, shifting into a half-crouch, about to pounce. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Don't you dare -
          
          Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE 
          DECK... then she finds herself 
          -
          
          
          IN A TREE - in his arms. When she realizes where she is, she 
          laughs, delighted. It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too..

          Esme and Dr. Cullen look out the window. Edward's LAUGHTER
          filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, smiles.
          
          
          ESME
          She's brought him to life.

          Alice has been wrong before.

          DR. CULLEN

          Esme turns to Dr. Cullen, gentle but absolutely firm.

          Carlisle. Bella is what he wants. 
          
          
          It will work out. Somehow. 
          
          
          Dr. Cullen smiles at her with love, then takes her hand as 
          they look back out the window..

          In theory. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Then close your eyes.
          
          
          She does, warily. He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to 
          another tree like a flying squirrel! Then, again, to the TOP of 
          another tree. He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella. 
          
          
          EDWARD

          valley, river, and the mountains beyond. CAMERA whirls around

          face in check... with minimal success. Outside the door, she 
          passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball TEAMMATES.
          
          
          MIKE
          Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen.
          
          
          She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile,
          as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Sorry I'm late. Biology project. 
          
          
          Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate 
          of seafood in front of Bella.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Ordered you the seafood combo.
          
          
          BELLA
          Order one for yourself next time. 
          You should cut back on the steak.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'm healthy as a horse.
          
          
          CORA
          
          
          (concerned)
          Say Chief, boys want to know, you 
          find anything down by Queets River 
          today?
          
          
          Charlie's aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too.
          He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          The suspect's moving east. Kitsap 
          County Sheriff is taking over from 
          here. They're putting extra guys on.
          
          
          CORA
          Hope they catch him fast.
          
          
          She moves off, with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella 
          pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an 
          easy rhythm now. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your friends are flagging you.
          
          
          
          70.
          She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, 
          straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It's okay you wanna join them. I'm 
          just gonna turn in early anyway.
          
          
          BELLA
          Yeah, me, too. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It's a Friday night. Go out. The 
          Newton boy's got a big smile for 
          you. Nice family, the Newtons.
          
          
          BELLA
          He's just a friend.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          None of the boys in town interest you?
          
          
          BELLA
          We're not really going to talk 
          about boys, are we?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just... you should be around people. 
          I leave you alone too much.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (with genuine affection)
          I've never minded being alone. Guess 
          I'm a lot like my dad that way. 
          
          
          Charlie smiles. These two have come a long way. Cora returns 
          -
          
          
          CORA
          Berry cobbler, two forks.
          
          
          She sets it between them. Off them, both reaching for forks..
          .
          
          
          91 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT 91
          
          
          Bella, dressed for bed, looks out the window as she talks on the 
          phone with Rene. Bella's euphoria still lingers in her eyes..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          So spring training's going well?
          
          
          INTERCUT WITH:
          
          
          92 INT. CAFE - NIGHT 92
          
          
          Rene talks on her cell. Phil is in the background, post-batting 
          practice, chowing down with a couple of teammates.
          
          
          
          71.
          RENE
          Phil's working hard. We're looking 
          around for a house to rent, in case 
          it becomes permanent. You'd like 
          Jacksonville, baby. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me. 
          
          
          RENE
          (stops, knows there's 
          
          
          more)
          Could... a guy have something to do 
          with that?
          
          
          BELLA
          (small smile)
          Maybe..
          .
          
          
          RENE
          Tell me everything! Jock? Indie? Bet 
          he's smart. Is he smart?
          
          
          BELLA
          (trying to avoid lies)
          Well... he is kind of a history buff.
          
          
          -- this as she turns to find 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD LYING ON HER BED, smiling. She nearly drops the phone.
          
          
          BELLA
          I, uh... have to go.
          
          
          RENE
          No way, we gotta talk boys. Are 
          you being safe?
          
          
          Edward shoots her a look, he heard that. She's mortified.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'll call you later, Mom. 
          
          
          STAY ON BELLA who hangs up.
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you get in here?
          
          
          EDWARD
          The window. As always.
          
          
          BELLA
          You've been here before?
          
          
          EDWARD
          What else is there to do at night? 
          
          
          
          72.
          She pushes him. He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her 
          onto the bed, wrestling as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
          
          
          EDWARD
          Shh! The Chief will hear you!
          
          
          But the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms 
          them, their laughter quieting. He studies her face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I just... like watching over you. 
          
          
          He raises his fingers to her lips, sending a thrill up her spine.
          
          
          EDWARD
          There's something I'd like to try. 
          
          
          She nods, bedazzled by him. He takes her face in his hands, 
          hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her..
          . 
          
          
          What neither of them is prepared for is her response. Her 
          breath comes in a wild GASP. Her fingers knot in his hair, 
          clutching him to her. Lips part as she breathes his scent..
          .
          
          
          Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her face back. She 
          opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild, his jaw clenched. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (mortified)
          Oh... I'm... oh.
          
          
          He relaxes slightly, looking at her blushing face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm stronger than I thought. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Wish I could say the same. I'm so 
          embarrassed.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Don't be. But we have to be careful.
          (serious)
          I can never lose control with you. Ever. 
          
          
          She nods, then carefully lies on his chest. He wraps his arms 
          around her. Off the two of them..
          .
          
          
          93 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 93
          
          
          Bella enters to find Charlie cleaning a rifle. He starts to 
          say hello but she just blurts out -
          -
          
          
          
          73.
          BELLA
          I have a date with Edward Cullen.
          
          
          He suddenly looks like he's having an aneurysm. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          He's too old for you.
          
          
          BELLA
          We're both juniors. I thought you 
          liked the Cullens. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          And I thought you weren't interested in 
          any of the boys in town. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward doesn't live in town. And 
          it's in the early stage and -
          -
          whatever, he's outside right now.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Now? He's out there?
          
          
          BELLA
          He wants to meet you. Officially. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Good.
          
          
          He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness.
          
          
          BELLA
          Be nice, okay? He's... important.
          
          
          Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she opens 
          the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka and gloves. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Chief Swan. I wanted to formally 
          introduce myself. I'm Edward.
          
          
          Edward extends his hand. Charlie takes it, but grunts 
          a 
          hello, resisting him.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I won't keep Bella out late 
          tonight. We're just going to go 
          play baseball with my family.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella's going to play baseball?
          
          
          Bella's equally surprised, but hides it.
          
          
          
          74.
          EDWARD
          Yes, sir, that's the plan.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Well. More power to you, I guess.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (looks him in the eyes)
          She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.
          
          
           As Edward exits... Charlie holds Bella back.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          (sotto)
          You got that pepper spray?
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Dad.
          
          
          94 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 94
          
          
          Edward and Bella climb into a massive JEEP parked in the drive.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (amused)
          Your father thinks you should go to 
          an all-girl's school.
          
          
          BELLA
          No fair, reading Charlie's mind. 
          
          
          As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          And since when do vampires like baseball? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's the American pastime. Plus, 
          there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the 
          only time we can play. You'll see why.
          
          
          95 EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - TWILIGHT 95
          
          
          Storm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in 
          the Jeep. She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an 
          enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. 
          
          
          Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella. 
          
          
          ESME
          Good thing you're here. We need 
          a 
          umpire. 
          
          
          EMMETT
          (big crooked grin)
          She thinks we cheat.
          
          
          
          75.
          ESME
          I know you cheat. Call em as you 
          see em, Bella.
          
          
          WHIP PAN to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound.
          
          
          ALICE
          It's time.
          
          
          -- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest.
          
          
          BEGIN MONTAGE - THE GAME
          
          
          And it's extraordinary. Bella stays by Esme who plays 
          catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward 
          and Emmett take positions in the outfield. 
          
          
          -- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat. It CRACKS 
          like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (to Esme)
          Now I get why you need the thunder.
          
          
          The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing 
          through the trees. Edward disappears after it.
          
          
          BELLA
          That has to be a home run.
          
          
          ESME
          Edward's very fast.
          
          
          Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out 
          of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate. WHAP! 
          Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Yer out?
          
          
          Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line 
          drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet 
          and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous 
          boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe! 
          
          
          JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest. But 
          before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS. 
          
          
          ALICE
          Stop! I didn't see them..
          . 
          
          
          They all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The 
          family instantly gathers at home plate. 
          
          
          ALICE
          They're traveling so quickly 
          -
          
          
          
          76.
          ROSALIE
          You said they left the county -
          -
          
          
          ALICE
          They did, but then they heard us..
          .
          (looking at Edward)
          And changed their minds.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (to Bella)
          Put your hair down 
          -
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Like that'll help. I could smell 
          her from across the field. 
          
          
          Edward ignores Rosalie as he arranges Bella's hair.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I shouldn't have brought you here. 
          I'm so sorry.
          
          
          She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward -
          
          THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
          
          
          There's a faint rustle... then James, Victoria and Laurent
          emerge. As they near, Bella SEES their bare feet, then the 
          deep BURGUNDY of their eyes. Laurent holds up the baseball. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          I believe this belongs to you.
          
          
          He tosses the ball (his casual toss is still blindingly fast) 
          to Dr. Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Thank you.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Could you use three more players?
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Of course.
          
          
          LAURENT
          I'm Laurent. This is Victoria. 
          And James.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Would you like to bat first?
          
          
          Laurent picks up a bat. The Cullens take the field. Dr. 
          Cullen is catcher, Edward is on first, with Bella behind him, 
          near the Jeep.
          
          
          
          77.
          Bella sees that Edward's eyes are locked onto James. Laurent
          is at bat first.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I'm afraid your hunting activities have 
          caused something of a mess for us. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          Our apologies. We didn't realize 
          the territory had been claimed. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Yes, we maintain a permanent 
          residence.
          
          
          The three newcomers exchange a look of surprise.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Really? Well, we won't be a problem 
          any more.
          
          
          VICTORIA
          The humans were tracking us, but we 
          led them East-
          
          
          Jasper pitches the ball -- Laurent SLAMS it -- but Alice is 
          up a tree is a flash and the ball slams into Alice's hand
          with a THWAP. Laurent is pissed, but James smiles ever so 
          slightly, delighted at the discovery of worthy opponents.
          
          
          James is up next and he POWER-SLAMS IT with AMAZING FORCE..
          .
          
          
          He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella..
          .
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA -- IN SLOW MOTION as the wind from the ball 
          ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, which floats to 
          -
          
          
          JAMES -- who suddenly SCREECHES to a halt. His head WHIPS 
          around at her and he lurches into a crouch, his nostrils 
          flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella.
          
          
          JAMES
          You brought a snack.
          
          
          EDWARD springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth. A truly 
          menacing, feral SNARL rips from his throat. James GROWLS back.
          
          
          OVERHEAD SHOT: in a flash, the Cullens rush into position 
          behind Edward -- Laurent and Victoria line up behind James. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          The girl is with us.
          
          
          
          78.
          LAURENT
          (trying to defuse 
          situation)
          We won't harm her.
          
          
          EMMETT
          (hungry for battle)
          Just try it.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I think it best if you leave.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Yes, I can see the game is over. 
          We'll go now. James?
          
          
          But James' eyes don't leave Edward's. Laurent puts a hand on
          James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the woods with
          his cohorts, disappearing. Once they're gone, Esme 
          immediately gathers up the bats-
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Get Bella out of here. We'll follow 
          them. 
          
          
          Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the 
          three vampires. Edward scoops Bella up as we 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - ON THE JEEP - LATE TWILIGHT 96
          
          
          Edward whips Bella into the Jeep and straps her in -
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          James is a tracker. I saw his mind. 
          The hunt is his obsession, and my 
          reaction set him off -
          -
          
          
          -- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          -- We're a large clan of strong fighters 
          all protecting one vulnerable human. 
          
          
          (dark with disgust)
          I just made this his most exciting 
          game ever.
          
          
          Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just 
          wrought up on them all as..
          .
          
          
          THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD
          
          
          A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until 
          they reach 
          -
          
          
          
          79.
          97 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 97
          
          
          THE JEEP speeds wildly down the road.
          
          
          EDWARD
          The first place he'll go is your 
          house. He'll track your scent 
          there.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (horrified)
          What?!? Charlie's there. He's in 
          danger because of me. Because of 
          us!
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (calmly)
          Then we'll lead the tracker away 
          from him. Somehow.
          
          
          He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING 
          -
          
          
          98 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 98
          
          
          Charlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly 
          BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated-
          
          
          BELLA
          I said, leave me alone! 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, don't do this. Just think 
          about it, please 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          Get out! It's over.
          
          
          She SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella? What happened? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I have to get out of this place. 
          Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.
          
          
          Bella runs upstairs. Charlie hurries after her 
          -
          
          
          99 INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 99
          
          
          Bella slams the door behind her. REVEAL Edward's already there,
          pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle 
          faster than humanly possible. Bella leans against the door. 
          
          
          
          80.
          BELLA
          (a pained whisper)
          I can't hurt him.
          
          
          Edward gives her a look, you have to. There's a KNOCK.
          
          
          INTERCUT Charlie on the other side. It's agony for both of them.
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          Bells. Did he hurt you?
          
          
          BELLA
          No, Dad. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Then what? Did he break up with you? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I broke up with him. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I thought you liked him?
          
          
          BELLA
          That's why I have to leave. I don't 
          want this. I want to go home.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (whispering)
          I'll be in the truck.
          
          
          And he disappears out the window. Bella gathers strength to 
          continue her performance. She opens the door to reveal Charlie. 
          He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into 
          -
          
          
          100 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STAIRS (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 100
          
          
          Bella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your mother's not even in Phoenix. 
          
          
          BELLA
          She'll come home. I'll call her 
          from the road.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You can't drive home now. I'll take 
          you to the airport in the morning.
          
          
          BELLA
          I want to drive. I need time to 
          think. I'll pull into a motel in 
          a 
          few hours. I promise.
          
          
          She heads down the stairs. Charlie follows..
          . 
          
          
          
          81.
          101 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) -NIGHT 101
          
          
          Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels. 
          She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          Bells, I know I'm not around much, 
          
          
          but I can change that. We can do 
          
          
          more things together.
          
          
          She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Like watch more baseball on the flat 
          
          
          screen? Or go to the Coffee Shop? 
          
          
          Same people, same steak, same berry 
          
          
          cobbler every night? That's you, 
          
          
          Dad. Not me.
          
          
          This hits Charlie hard. She can barely stand it, heads down 
          the stairs, as he takes a second to recover..
          .
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella... I just got you back.
          
          
          Which breaks Bella's heart... and forces her to deliver the
          final blow.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          And if I don't get out now, I'm 
          
          
          going get stuck here like mom did.
          
          
          Charlie is stunned, wounded. She takes advantage of his 
          shock, pushing past him out the door. 
          
          
          102 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 102
          
          
          Bella exits, heads to her truck. Fresh tears spring to her 
          eyes. 
          
          
          ANGLE ON THE WOODS 
          
          
          Trees, branches... and a pair of DEADLY EYES. James. He watches 
          from a distance as Bella pulls out. The truck moves off... and 
          so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain, staring out 
          the window.
          
          
          103 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT 103
          
          
          Bella drives, wiping tears away. Suddenly Edward is outside 
          the car, near Bella's window. 
          
          
          
          82.
          EDWARD
          He'll forgive you.
          (off Bella's startled look)
          Slide over..
          .
          
          
          Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the 
          door, sliding in, and takes the wheel. Bella slumps.
          
          
          BELLA
          His face... I said the same words 
          my mother used when she left him. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It was the only way he'd let you go. 
          
          
          Edward FLOORS it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Your father's safe now, Bella. The 
          tracker is following us 
          -
          
          
          Suddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the 
          truck. Bella SCREAMS. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's alright. It's just Emmett. 
          Alice is in the car behind us. 
          
          
          She catches her breath. It kills him to see her so frightened. 
          She looks out the window as they drive through town..

          The small, insulated town passes by in SLOW MOTION... INSIDE we 
          SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, flirting, innocent,

          105 EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT 105
          
          
          Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the 
          house... but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits. They 
          immediately take defensive positions but Dr. Cullen appears.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          He came to warn us. About James.
          
          
          They back down slightly. Laurent address Dr. Cullen.
          
          
          LAURENT
          I've grown tired of his games. But 
          he's got unparalleled senses. 
          Absolutely lethal. I've never seen 
          anything like him in three hundred 
          years ... And the woman, Victoria, 
          will back him. Don't underestimate 
          her.
          
          
          
          83.
          Dr. Cullen nods thanks. Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          I'm truly sorry for what's been 
          unleashed here.
          
          
          And he moves off, disappearing into the woods..

          106 INT. CULLEN HOUSE - FOUR CAR GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          
          The side door BURSTS OPEN as Edward and the Cullens enter, 
          followed by Bella. The lights flip on to reveal a pristine 
          garage; the Volvo, the red BMW, a black Mercedes sedan, an SUV. 
          
          
          Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for 
          supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable GPS units, 
          changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc. As they load up the 
          vehicles 
          -
          
          
          JASPER
          I've had to fight our kind before. 
          We're hard to kill.
          
          
          EDWARD
          But not impossible. We'll tear him up 
          
          
          EMMETT
          
          
          (with bloodlust)
          We'll rip him apart with our hands, 
          then burn the pieces 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I don't relish killing another creature. 
          Even a sadistic one like James.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          If he doesn't get to one of us 
          first.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (horrified)
          This is insane. You can't put yourselves 
          in danger like this - for me.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Too late.
          
          
          Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys 
          off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll run Bella south, while you lead 
          the tracker away 
          -
          
          
          
          84.
          DR. CULLEN
          No, Edward -- the tracker thinks 
          you won't leave Bella. He'll 
          follow you.
          
          
          ALICE
          I'll go with Bella. Jasper and 
          I 
          will drive her south.
          
          
          (facing him)
          I'll keep her safe, Edward.
          
          
          Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (studies her, torn)
          Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
          
          
          She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders 
          his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases,
          pulling out clothes, tossing them to 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the 
          tracker will pick up Bella's scent. 
          
          
          ROSALIE
          
          
          (dropping the clothes)
          Why should I? What is she to me? Just 
          a danger you've inflicted on us 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
          (spinning on her)
          Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's 
          a part of this family now. And we 
          protect our family. 
          
          
          She glowers, but picks up the clothes. Dr. Cullen hits the door 
          opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen 
          squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the
          SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars 
          -
          
          
          Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together.
          
          
          BELLA
          If any of you get hurt because of me 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          We won't, there are five of us, two of 
          them. When it's done, I'll come get you. 
          
          
          He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're my life now.
          
          
          
          85.
          They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV 
          PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME 
          -
          
          
          107 EXT. HIGHWAY, PACIFIC NORTHWEST - DAWN 107
          
          
          The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black 
          MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame 
          -
          
          
          108 INT. MERCEDES - SAME 108
          
          
          Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat. Bella is in the 
          back, her eyes red from crying. She talks on her cell phone 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Mom, it's me again. You must have 
          
          
          let your phone die. Anyway, I'm 
          
          
          not in Forks anymore but I'm okay. 
          
          
          I'll explain when you call.
          
          
          She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, 
          misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face -
          
          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEN THE NIGHT 
          
          
          -- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green 
          forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner 
          surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash 
          by us. Finally, we land in..

          TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, 
          Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through 
          the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead.
          
          
          Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie 
          tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING 
          MAPLE TREE. And then they're gone.

          Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the 
          river. In the distance, below, they SEE 
          -
          
          
          THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks 
          in their direction. Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has 
          their scent, they continue over the hill's crest.

          James blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, backtracks to 
          the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric. He starts off again..
          . 
          but stops, smells the fabric. Something's not right. He runs
          back in the opposite direction... Uh oh..
          .
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          115 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 115
          
          
          ON BELLA'S FACE: her eyes pop open. She's lying atop a bed, 
          fully clothed. She rises, reorienting.
          
          
          116 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 116
          
          
          The blinds are pulled. Alice and Jasper stare blankly at 
          a 
          
          
          T.V. set. Several plates of food crowd a table. Alice looks 
          up as Bella enters, looking at her cell phone. 
          BELLA
          I wish he'd call.
          
          
          ALICE
          You should eat.
          
          
          But Bella ignores the food. She sits heavily.
          
          
          BELLA
          They could get hurt. It's not 
          worth it.
          
          
          JASPER
          (insistent)
          Yes. It is. 
          
          
          She's taken aback. It's the first time he's engaged with her.
          
          
          JASPER
          Edward's changed since he found 
          you. And none of us want to look 
          into his eyes for the next hundred 
          years if he loses you. 
          
          
          (he looks forward again)
          It's worth it.
          
          
          Suddenly, Alice REELS. Jasper goes to her, Bella follows.
          
          
          JASPER
          What do you see?
          
          
          ALICE
          (with deep worry)
          The tracker. He just changed course..
          .
          
          
          Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her. 
          
          
          
          87.
          JASPER
          Where will it take him, Alice?
          
          
          PUSH IN ON ALICE'S FACE as we-
          
          
          FLASH POP TO - JAMES
          
          
          A disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of..
          .
          
          
          ALICE
          Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors.
          
          
          Alice begins to draw at HYPER SPEED, closing her eyes, trying 
          to see it clearly.
          
          
          BELLA
          How do the visions work? Edward 
          said they weren't always certain. 
          
          
          JASPER
          She sees the course people are on, 
          while they're on it. If they change 
          their minds, the visions change. 
          
          
          Bella looks over Alice's shoulder to see the drawing.
          
          
          BELLA
          So the course James is on now will 
          lead him to... a ballet studio?
          
          
          ALICE
          (looks up at her)
          You've been here?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. I don't know. I used to take 
          ballet lessons as a kid. The 
          school had an arch like that.
          
          
          JASPER
          Was your school here in Phoenix? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Yeah, around the corner from my house. 
          But I haven't been there in ten years.
          
          
          JASPER
          Do you have any reason to go now?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. Hell, no. I hated the place.
          
          
          Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out. 
          Suddenly, Bella JUMPS as her cell phone RINGS. She picks it 
          up. Sees the caller I.D. and exhales relief. She answers..

          EDWARD
          I'm coming to get you. 
          (hates having to say 
          
          
          this)
          We lost the tracker. The woman is 
          still in the area. Rosalie and 
          Esme are protecting your father.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (sinking)
          This is my fault. You warned me, 
          but I didn't think. I just..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, we're in too deep. We can't 
          change how we feel..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          No... we can't.
          (then)
          When will you get here?
          
          
          EDWARD
          In a couple hours. Then you and 
          I 
          will go somewhere. Together. The 
          others will keep hunting.
          
          
          (then, determined)
          Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever 
          it takes to make you safe again.

          -
          
          
          HEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Mom? Are you there?
          
          
          Then Bella HEARS a voice that sends a chill down her spine 
          -
          
          
          JAMES (O.S.
          )
          Nice house you have here. Not the 
          best on the block, but comfortable. 
          
          
          INTERCUT WITH:
          
          
          120 INT. RENE'S HOUSE, PHOENIX - DAY 120
          
          
          VERY CLOSE ON JAMES, his sinister eyes and vicious smile.
          
          
          JAMES
          I was prepared to wait for you. 
          But then Mom came home after she 
          received a very worried call from 
          your Dad. It all worked out quite 
          well.
          
          
          Bella's eyes are wild with fear.
          
          
          JAMES
          I must say, Forks High School doesn't 
          protect its students' privacy very 
          well. It was just too easy for 
          Victoria to find your previous address. 
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Bella? Bella?..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Leave my mother out of this.
          
          
          JAMES
          You're protective of her. That's 
          nice. You can still save her. But 
          you'll need to get away from your 
          friends. Can you do that? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I... don't think so.
          
          
          
          90.
          JAMES
          If your mother's life depends on it? 
          
          
          Bella is terrified, but there's no choice here. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Where should I meet you?
          
          
          James grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that's attached to
          the refrigerator with a magnet. It's the same photo Charlie
          has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor. 
          
          
          JAMES
          The old ballet studio around the 
          corner. And I'll know if you bring 
          anyone along. Poor mommy would pay 
          the price for that mistake.
          
          
          (sniffs the air)
          She smells like you. Delicious.
          
          
          STAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked. She starts flinging 
          open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit. 
          Useless. Then she remembers..
          .
          
          
          Her purse. She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper 
          spray Charlie gave her. She clings to it, her only protection 
          now.

          127 INT./EXT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - TWILIGHT - DRIVING 127
          
          
          Bella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. 
          She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the 
          Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion. She slips out the 
          opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the 
          door. The DRIVER is an elderly woman with a hacking COUGH. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (taking a breath for 
          courage)
          8th and Palo Verde, please.
          
          
          The taxi pulls out. Bella watches the hotel disappear. Off 
          her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW..

          Once again, we see the polished malls, the manicured cactus 
          gardens. All empty for the night. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.

          But dying in the place of someone 
          I

          Bella climbs out of the taxi. It pulls away, leaving her on the 
          curb facing the deserted building. Bella twirls her mother's
          ring around her finger, then reaches for the pepper spray.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          
          
          I can't bring myself to regret the 
          
          
          decisions that brought me face to 
          
          
          face with death... they also 
          
          
          brought me to Edward.
          
          
          She slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket. She wraps 
          her purse strap around her wrist. She takes a breath, 
          approaches the school. Peers in the windows. The blinds are 
          drawn. But from inside, we HEAR a faint sound..
          .
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Bella? Bella? 
          
          
          It's time. Bella goes to the front door. It's unlocked.

          133 INT. MIMI'S SCHOOL OF DANCE - STUDIO - NIGHT 133
          
          
          Bella cautiously enters this grand, empty room of mirrors. 
          A 
          ballet bar wraps around the walls -
          -
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Bella, where are you? 
          
          
          Bella whirls, trying to find its source. She follows the sound to 
          a cleaning supply CLOSET. She throws open the door to FIND 
          -
          
          
          A T.V. - ON SCREEN A VIDEO PLAYS - Bella, age 7, hides in the 
          very closet the T.V. is in now. Little Bella looks up at us. 
          
          
          
          92.
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Don't you want to dance, baby? 
          
          
          Little Bella shakes her head stubbornly. The frame jiggles 
          as Rene hands someone the camera. Rene, ten years younger, 
          appears on screen and kneels next to Bella.
          
          
          BELLA
          Everyone makes fun of me.
          
          
          RENE
          But you're a wonderful dancer.
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, I suck. 
          
          
          LAUGHTER behind Bella. She spins, trying to locate James in 
          the mirrors. 
          
          
          JAMES
          That's my favorite part. Stubborn 
          child, weren't you?
          
          
          Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief. 
          
          
          BELLA
          She's not here.
          
          
          JAMES
          Sorry. But you really made it too easy.
          
          
          Visible in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he steps 
          up next to her and points a VIDEO CAMERA at Bella. 
          
          
          JAMES
          So to make things more entertaining, 
          I'm going to make a little film of our 
          time together. Borrowed this from 
          your house. Hope you don't mind. 
          
          
          (turns it on)
          And... action!
          
          
          Bella FLINGS her purse at him, and runs for the door.
          
          
          JAMES
          Excellent! An escape attempt.
          
          
          Suddenly, he's right behind her. She freezes. 
          
          
          JAMES
          It'll break Edward's little heart.
          
          
          He smells her hair. Touches her throat. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward has nothing to do with this.
          
          
          
          93.
          JAMES
          He will. His rage will make for 
          more interesting sport than his 
          feeble attempt to protect you.
          
          
          He's having too much fun to notice --the peppers spray in
          her hand. She spins around and sprays him. 
          
          
          Then she runs, as James REELS back briefly. But he leaps 
          over her and lands RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. 
          
          
          Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball. 
          She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column. James captures it 
          on film. 
          
          
          JAMES
          Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. 
          I chose my stage well.
          
          
          He advances toward her.
          
          
          JAMES
          Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that 
          what makes you special? Because 
          frankly, I don't see it. 
          
          
          He inhales as if he can taste her already 
          -
          
          
          JAMES
          Too bad he didn't have the strength 
          to turn you. Instead, he kept you 
          this fragile little human. It's 
          cruel, really. 
          
          
          James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper 
          spray. He tries to wipe it off.
          
          
          JAMES
          Well done! You've succeeded in 
          annoying me.
          
          
          He STOMPS on her shin! HEAR her tibia SNAP! Bella SCREAMS in 
          agony. 
          
          
          JAMES
          Tell Edward how much it hurts. 
          
          
          Abruptly, the camera is in her face 
          -
          
          
          JAMES
          Tell him to avenge you.
          
          
          BELLA
          No! Edward, don't..

          94.
          James inhales as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, 
          half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face

          JAMES
          Cut! The end.
          
          
          Suddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME! 
          
          
          He rises to find himself face to face with Edward. James 
          CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column. 
          
          
          JAMES
          You're alone... because you're 
          faster than the others. But not 
          stronger.
          
          
          James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm strong enough to kill you.
          
          
          Edward FLINGS James backwards -- SMASHING through 
          a 
          freestanding mirror -- into the doorway. He scoops Bella up 
          and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he 
          and Bella are JERKED downward.
          
          
          James YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella 
          out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top 
          window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks. 
          
          
          James crouches beside Bella. He grabs her HAND 
          -
          
          
          Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS 
          HIS TEETH into Bella's hand! She SCREAMS in agony. 
          
          
          Edward's rage ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the window casement 
          and SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely PLOWING him through 
          the floorboards.
          
          
          ON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins.

          Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY 
          of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when -
          -
          
          
          Suddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle.
          Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like 
          a 
          baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror. 
          
          
          James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the sound of 
          her pain slices through Edward. In an animalistic fury, 
          Edward BITES OFF a piece of James' flesh ..

          WHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to DR. CULLEN --now
          standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder.
          
          
          Edward turns to see his father -- and EMMETT, JASPER, and 
          ALICE, dropping down from the balcony.
          
          
          Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far.
          He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and 
          LUNGE at James like a pack of animals.
          
          
          Dr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in 
          pain. Edward dashes toward her -

          BELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in and out
          of focus... it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip 
          out the floorboards and build a fire ... it's like a funeral
          pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire..
          . 
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side. Dr. Cullen works 
          fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her 
          leg. But clearly her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain.

          Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh -
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Her femoral artery's been severed. 
          She's losing too much blood 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          It's on fire! My hand!
          
          
          EDWARD
          Venom -
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
           (working on Bella)
          
          
          You have to make a choice. Either 
          
          
          let the change happen 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          No!
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ALICE appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct.
          
          
          ALICE
          It's going to happen. I've seen it 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          It doesn't have to be that way.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Alice, find me a tourniquet. 
          A 
          rag, a shirt.
          
          
          
          96.
          Alice holds her nose and avoids the blood as she rips the 
          sleeve off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr. Cullen. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It's burning!
          
          
          EDWARD
          What's the other choice? You said 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (to Alice)
          Tighter, above the knee 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          Carlisle.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          You can try to suck the venom out. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I -- won't be able to stop 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Find the will to stop. But choose, 
          she only has minutes left.
          
          
          Edward looks down at Bella, thrashing in pain. Finally, 
          Edward takes her hand. She tries to pull it away.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's alright, Bella. I'll make it 
          go away. 
          
          
          He looks at her - then starts to suck the venom from her 
          hand. They never take their eyes off one another, the 
          connection palpable, intense..
          . 
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA'S EYES -wild with pain. But subsiding..
          .
          
          
          CLOSE ON EDWARD'S EYES -the frenzy has begun. He sucks
          harder. Hungrily. Anguished, he wants to stop but can't. 
          Dr. Cullen's voice sounds miles away..
          .
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Stop. Her blood is clean, you're 
          killing her.
          
          
          -- but the bloodlust is too strong. He is killing her. Bella 
          looks at him, forgivingly, as she begins to lose consciousness..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ON EDWARD -growing blurry... he disappears
          into the blinding light. It's as if she's underwater, like
          her dreams..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Death is peaceful. Easy.
          
          
          
          97.
          Bella starts to float away... we're losing her..
          .
          Suddenly from the darkness, Edward reaches out a hand..
          .
          A brilliant light flares..
          .
          
          
          134 BELLA'S FACE APPEARS IN THE WHITENESS
          Eyes closed. But they slowly open. She squints at the light. 
          BELLA
          Life... is harder..
          . 
          An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, 
          confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus.
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          
          
          You're awake, baby! You're okay!!
          !
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
          Bella lies in a hospital bed. Bandaged, leg in a cast. In bad 
          
          
          shape. Rene hovers over her, tears in her eyes. On the dresser, 

          SEE get well cards and a PHOTO MONTAGE of her friends from Forks.
          BELLA
          Edward? Where's -
          RENE
          He's asleep.
          She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps.
          
          
          
          RENE
          He never leaves. And your dad's 
          down in the cafeteria. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What... happened?
          
          
          RENE
          Baby, you fell down two flights of 
          stairs and through a window. 
          
          
          Bella is drawing a blank, confused. Rene jogs her memory 
          -
          RENE
          Edward came here to convince you to 
          come back to Forks. His father 
          brought him down. You went to their 
          hotel but you tripped on the stairs. 
          A moment... then Bella realizes it's a cover story. She nods.
          BELLA
          Sounds like me.
          
          
          
          98.
          Rene's cell phone BEEPS. She opens it. Reads a text, starts
          typing in a reply.
          
          
          RENE
          It's Phil. He's worried about you.
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, you're... texting.
          
          
          RENE
          
          
           (smiling)
          I told him to stay in Florida. The 
          Suns signed him! 
          
          
          BELLA
          That's great mom.
          
          
          RENE
          Jacksonville is always sunny and 
          you'll have your own bathroom..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, wait. I want to live in 
          Forks. I have Dad..
          . 
          
          
          (re: the get well cards)
          ... and friends..
          .
          
          
          RENE
          (re: Edward)
          And he's there. 
          
          
          Bella shrugs, conceding the truth.
          
          
          RENE
          Charlie doesn't like him. Blames 
          him for your leaving. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What do you think?
          
          
          RENE
          
          
          (lowering her voice)
          I think that boy is in love with 
          you.
          
          
          Bella smiles. Rene grins. Bella glances at Edward.
          
          
          BELLA
          Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? 
          I 
          want to talk to him. Apologize.
          
          
          RENE
          I'm sure he doesn't care about 
          that, Baby. But Ill go get him.
          
          
          
          99.
          Rene kisses Bella's forehead. Exits. Bella watches her go.
          The door shutting behind her. Bella turns back to find 
          Edward standing next to her with deep concern. Her eyes 
          well. He kisses her forehead soothingly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Is James - did you -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          We took care of him. And the 
          woman, Victoria, she ran off.
          
          
          She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm alive because of you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (darkens)
          You're in here because of me. 
          
          
          Her wounds cause him pain. He strokes her face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          The worst of it... was thinking 
          I 
          couldn't stop -
          
          BELLA
          But you did. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. 
          Where I can't hurt you anymore..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          What? No! I want to be with you! 
          I 
          don't want 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (sitting next to her)
          Sssh. It's alright. I'm not going 
          anywhere. I'm right here..
          .
          
          
          He wraps an arm around her. As she curls up in his arms..

          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          135 EXT. FORKS, WASHINGTON - LATE AFTERNOON 135
          
          
          An AERIAL SWEEP over the lush green forests. We're back in
          the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest..

          136 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEAUTIFUL LATE AFTERNOON 136
          
          
          At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife. 
          Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant 
          suit. But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare. The
          front door opens and they look up to see 
          -
          
          
          BELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress. Edward 
          is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to 
          her LEG CAST. Charlie edges out Edward to help her down. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Alice lent me the dress. It was the 
          
          
          only thing that would fit over my 
          
          
          cast. Is it too... 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          You're perfect... I'll take good 
          
          
          care of her, Chief. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Heard that before. 
          
          
          Edward moves to open the car door. Charlie holds Bella back.
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          (sotto)
          I put new pepper spray in your bag.

          Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella
          out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining 
          room. Mr. Molina and other teachers are there. We may 
          notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          I can't believe you're making me do 
          
          
          this.
          
          
          He just grins. Edward guides her around a corner to..

          THE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette 
          wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, 
          dance and socialize. 
          
          
          
          101.
          BELLA
          You really are trying to kill me.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Prom is an important rite of 
          passage. I don't want you to miss 
          anything. 
          
          
          She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately.
          They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees 
          -
          
          
          THE DANCE FLOOR, where a gap has formed. In the middle, two 
          couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and 
          Emmett, looking absolutely stunning. 
          
          
          Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury. But 
          Alice waves brightly. Bella returns it with a smile as we 
          hear a crossfade into the next track-

          -
          
          
          It's Eric at the turntables, making the room bounce! Next to
          him, Angela wears the headphones, flipping through a stack of 
          vinyl. They nod at Bella -- she shoots them a smile when -
          -
          
          
          A FLASHBULB gets her attention 
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - PHOTOGRAPHER'S STATION
          
          
          Mike and Jessica stand in front of an Aston Martin cut-out. 
          Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond 
          impersonation. Jessica poses like Pussy Galore.
          
          
          Edward smirks, then turns to Bella 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Shall we? 
          
          
          BELLA
          (laughs, then realizes)
          You're serious.
          
          
          He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to
          the DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own... and 
          starts to move. She actually begins to enjoy it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          See? You're dancing.
          
          
          BELLA
          At prom.
          
          
          As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength. Becomes 
          thoughtful. Finally, she looks at him.

          Edward... why did you save me?
          (off his questioning look)
          If you'd let the venom spread, 
          I could've been like you by now.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (stops, horrified)
          You don't know what you're saying. 
          You don't want this.
          
          
          BELLA
          I want you. Always.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (angry)
          I won't end your life for you. 
          
          
          He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm dying anyway. Every minute, 
          I get closer, older 
          
          EDWARD
          That's how it's supposed to happen. 
          
          BELLA
          Not the way Alice saw it. 
          (off his sharp look)
          I heard her. She saw me like you. 
          
          EDWARD
          Her visions change, Bella. 
          
          BELLA
          Based on what someone decides. And 
          I've decided.
          
          
          He looks at her, angry. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Is that what you dream about? 
          Becoming a monster? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I dream about being with you forever. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You really want this?
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes.
          
          
          He lowers his lips to her neck. One bite is all it would take. 
          
          
          
          103.
          EDWARD
          You're ready right now?
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes.
          
          
          His lips hover over her skin, a long beat... then he presses his 
          lips to her throat. Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're going to have a long and 
          happy life with me. Isn't that 
          enough?
          
          
          She looks at him... and finally smiles.
          
          
          BELLA
          For now.
          
          
          They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from 
          one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other's arms..
          .
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          No one will surrender tonight. But 
          I won't give in. I know what I want.
          
          
          CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the dance floor. We realize ..
          
          ... someone's watching it, looking down from the window of 
          a second floor hotel room in the Inn. The MUSIC wafting up in 
          echoes. PULL BACK to REVEAL..
          
          VICTORIA, turning from the window. She's stylishly dressed
          now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her 
          throat. PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES 
          filled with vengeance as we 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO BLACK.

CREDITS OVER:                                                   

A FULL MOON FILLS THE FRAME -- Luminous, tinged with gold.      
Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the          
moon's surface, darkening it from left to right...              

                            BELLA (V.O.)
                "These violent delights have violent
                ends..."

... until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon...        
which disappears into the darkness.                             

OVER BLACK - A RUFFLED TULIP appears, isolated against the      
blackness.                                                      
                            BELLA (V.O.)                        
                "... And in their triumph die, like             
                fire and powder..."                             

HOLD ON the tulip as the background FADES UP around it to       
reveal we're now in --                                          

EXT. FOREST - ECU ON THE TULIP - DAY                            

It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest       
floor.                                                          

                            BELLA (V.O.)
                "... Which, as they kiss, consume..."           

SUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly            
crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it        
grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off --                    

ON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET                                     
They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA          
SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS    
of her frenetic quest --

                           BELLA
                Edward!

Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES       
SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it --

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

                           BELLA
                Edward!

                                                             2.



-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where        
Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now.        
Instead, Bella SEES --

ACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her
withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she
recognizes --

                           BELLA
              ... Gran?

GRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves,
as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but --

                           EDWARD (O.S.)
              Bella...
She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --

EDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp         
contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in
love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from
sun's rays --                                                      

                          BELLA
              Stop - she'll see!

But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight.                
Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow              
shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight.

JUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening,
entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then
arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to --          

Gran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is
extended, as if she also holds someone.
JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now.
Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that --

Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror,
Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass!                    

PULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME.        
It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a       
surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella.              

                           BELLA
              Oh my God.

-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five         
years older.

                                                            3.


Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward.
He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it.

Then he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and           
whispers into her ear --                                          

                          EDWARD
              Happy birthday.

                                                  SMASH TO:       

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

ON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A
book, "ROMEO AND JULIET," lays open on her chest. Bella
sits up, the dream still weighing on her...
INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the       
Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the
door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one
wrapped, one not.

                          CHARLIE
              Happy birthday, Bells.

                          BELLA
              Dad, we agreed, no gifts.

                          CHARLIE
              At least mine's not wrapped.

He hands it to her. It's a digital camera.   Bella's
pleased, despite herself.

                          BELLA
              Okay, this is actually kind of great.
              Thanks, Dad.

                          CHARLIE
                   (re: wrapped gift)
              Goes with this one from your mom. We
              coordinated - well, she coordinated
              me.

Bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a SCRAPBOOK.

                          CHARLIE
              To put your pictures in, record your
              senior year -- man, senior year.
              How'd you get so old so fast?

                          BELLA
              Not that old.

                                                           4.



                          CHARLIE
              I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?

Bella races to the mirror, searches her face.

                          CHARLIE
              I was kidding.

                          BELLA
              So not funny, Dad.

EXT. FORKS HIGHWAY - DAY

An AERIAL VIEW of this lush, green, overcast landscape; the
rainy world that is Forks. FIND Bella's old truck as it
lumbers down the two-lane highway...
                          BELLA (V.O.)
              It was just a dream... but also my
              worst nightmare.                                   

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bella climbs out of her truck, shouldering her book bag.
She looks around the parking lot, seeking Edward --              

                          MIKE (O.S.)
              Wherefore art thou, Bella?

She turns as MIKE, ERIC, ANGELA and JESSICA approach.

                          MIKE
              You finish the Shakespeare assignment?

                          JESSICA
              He means will you finish his
              assignment?
                          MIKE
              No, I don't -- okay I do.

                          BELLA
              I can help you with it -- but first --
                   (pulling out her camera)
              I need a picture. My mom's expecting
              a scrapbook full of memories.

                          ANGELA
                   (holds up her own camera)
              I take `em, I don't pose for `em.

                          BELLA
              You do today.                                      

                                                          5.



She pushes Angela to the others; they arrange themselves --     

                          JESSICA
              You'll photoshop my nose if it looks              
              big, right?                                       

                          ERIC
              Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no
              one will be looking at you guys.

Jessica scoffs, Angela points her camera at Bella; Mike and
Eric joust -- Bella aims --                                     

FULL FRAME - THE CAMERA'S DIGITAL SCREEN                        

It FREEZES on them, fun, delightfully carefree... but when      
the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they     
see someone behind Bella. She turns to see --                   

EDWARD climbing out of his silver Volvo.

                         MIKE                                   
                   (dry)                                        
              Oh good. Cullen's here.                           

                            JESSICA                             
                      (drier)                                   
              Yay.                                              

The friends, uncomfortable, move off --

                          ERIC                                  
              Check ya later.

-- But Bella doesn't register their tone. She's transfixed      
by Edward who approaches, eyes never leaving hers. He           
reaches her, washing away all her concerns --
                          EDWARD
              Happy birthday.

-- except that one.    Her face falls.

                          BELLA
              Don't remind me.

                          EDWARD                                
              Your birth is definitely a day to                 
              celebrate.                                        

                            BELLA                               
              Not for me.                                       

                                                          6.



                          EDWARD                                
              Eighteen is a little early to be                  
              worrying about your age.

                          BELLA
              It's one year older than you.

                          EDWARD
              Bella, I'm ninety.

                          BELLA
              True. Maybe I should be creeped out               
              that I'm dating such an old guy.                  

                          EDWARD                                
                   (smiles, amused)                             
              Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not              
              the fact that you're dating a vampire.            

Then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly. She kisses him         
back... despite their restraint, the passion mounts... until
he pulls away. As always, both are left wanting more.
Edward nods toward the school building --                       

                          EDWARD                                
              Class.                                            

                           BELLA                                
              Right.   Class.                                   

Catching their breath, they start toward school... but          
Edward stops, hearing something in his mind. Irritated.         

                          EDWARD                                
              Someone wants you.

                          JACOB (O.S.)
              Bella!
JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long,
black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall,
muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy,     
still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward,
who moves off to the side but eyes them.

                          BELLA
              God, Jacob, what are they feeding you
              on that rez, steroids? You're huge.

                          JACOB
              Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came
              around more.

                                                            7.



                          BELLA
              I will, soon. But isn't your school,
              like, ten miles that way?

                          JACOB
                   (re: car part)
              Just here buying this for the Rabbit.
              I'm almost done with the rebuild.
              Gotta come take a ride when it's done.              
                   (as if remembering)
              Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad
              told my dad. So...

He pulls from his coat a small woven DREAMCATCHER, feathers       
dangling from it. He hands it to her.
                          JACOB
              I saw it the other day and thought of
              you - it catches bad dreams.

                          BELLA
              This, I need. It's great.

                          EDWARD
              The bell's about to ring.

The bell RINGS. Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with         
just a hint of snark.                                             

                          JACOB                                   
              Ooh, look at you, all psychic.                      

                          EDWARD                                  
              I don't have that particular gift.                  
              But I can read a watch. I'm clever                  
              that way.                                           

They share a tight smile.   Bella intercedes, squeezing           
Jacob's arm.                                                      

                          BELLA
              Bye, Jake, and thank you.

Edward guides her away.   As they walk off --                     

                          EDWARD
              How come Jacob Black gets to give you
              a gift and I don't?

                          BELLA
              He's just a friend.

                                                          8.



                          EDWARD
              "Friends" don't spend two weeks
              looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.

                          BELLA
              Stop reading his mind if he bothers
              you so much.

                          EDWARD
              Little hard to tune out.

She just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with
resentment. Jacob holds his gaze.

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small,
wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it.

                         ALICE
              Happy --

                         BELLA
              Shh!

-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella --

                          ALICE
              -- birthday.

Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his
distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide       
Alice's present, hoping no one noticed --

                          BELLA
              Alice, didn't I say no gifts?                     

                          ALICE
              You did. I didn't. I've already seen
              you open it and guess what? You love
              it.

                          BELLA
              You had a vision about my birthday.

                          ALICE
              And about the green dress you'll be
              wearing to your party tonight. Great
              color on you.

                          BELLA                                 
              ... My party?                                     

                                                           9.



                             ALICE                               
              Please?     It'll be fun.                          

                          BELLA                                  
                   (beat, confused)                              
              I... guess I can deal --                           

                         ALICE                                   
                   (hurriedly)                                   
              -- Great! See ya at seven!                         

Alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her     
mind. Which is when Bella realizes --                            

                          BELLA                                  
              Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood                
              control.                                           

He offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away.         

                            EDWARD                               
              Vampires.    You can't trust them.                 

                                                     CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A T.V. MONITOR - Zeffirelli's `68 "Romeo and
Juliet" plays. The suicide scene.

                          ROMEO
              Arms, take your last embrace, and
              lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal
              with a righteous kiss...

PULL BACK TO INCLUDE --

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

The room is dark as we PAN OVER the class, some students
entertained, some moved, Mike trying not to fall asleep.
The teacher, MR. BERTY, mouths every word --

                          ROMEO
              Here's to my love!
                   (drinks)
              O true apothecary!    Thy drugs are quick.

FIND Edward and Bella in the back of the room, desks pushed
together, whisper-talking.

                          BELLA                                  
              I hate being... celebrated.                        

                                                            10.



                          EDWARD                                   
              Come on, the last real birthday any of               
              us had was Emmett's - I think Bing
              Crosby was on top of the charts.
                   (then)                                          
              You'll be helping us feel normal for a               
              night.                                               

Bella sits back, knowing she's trapped.    He kisses her hand.     

                          EDWARD                                   
              There are worse tragedies than a                     
              birthday. Look at Romeo. He's                        
              responsible for his wife's death. Who                
              could live with that?                                
                   (looks at the screen)                           
              ... Though I do envy him one thing.                  

                          BELLA
                   (blanches slightly)
              Juliet's alright... if you like that
              obviously beautiful sort of thing.

                          EDWARD
              Not the girl - the suicide.
                   (off her look)                                  
              Nearly impossible for my kind. But
              humans, a little poison, dagger to the
              heart. There are so many options.                    

                          BELLA
                   (appalled)
              Why would you even think about that?

He turns her wrist over, runs his hand over the horseshoe          
shaped SCAR on her forearm.                                        

                          EDWARD
                   (shrugs)                                        
              I considered it. Once.      When James               
              had you trapped.                                     

FLASHPOP TO "Twilight" - In the ballet studio, JAMES grabs         
Bella's arm and BITES --                                           

BACK ON EDWARD - pained.                                           

                          EDWARD
              I didn't know if I'd find you in time.
              If I'd gotten you killed --

                          BELLA
              It wouldn't have been your fault --

                                                         11.



                          EDWARD
              Either way, I had a plan.                          

                            BELLA                                
              What plan?                                         

                          EDWARD                                 
              There are... ways for us. At least                 
              one way. I would have gone to Italy,               
              provoked the Volturi...                            

                            BELLA                                
              The who?                                           

                          MR. BERTY                              
              Is there something you'd like to share             
              with the class, Edward?                            

                          EDWARD                                 
                   (politely)                                    
              Certainly not. But I apologize for                 
              being a distraction. Perhaps you                   
              should rewind to act five, scene one,              
              line twenty-eight eighty-nine --                   
                   (reciting)                                    
              "If you had the strength of twenty men             
              it would dispatch you straight."                   

Mr. Berty just looks at him, then moves off, intimidated --      

                          MR. BERTY                              
              Eyes on the screen, people.                        

Bella is too concerned to be amused.                             

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT                                        

Lights glow from inside the beautiful house.                     
                          EDWARD (O.S.)                          
              The Volturi are a very old, very                   
              powerful family...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

ON AN 18TH CENTURY OIL PAINTING, depicting Grecian figures in
swirling robes writhing among pillars and balconies. In a
high balcony, FOUR CALM FIGURES look down upon the bacchanal;
two black haired, one snowy white, one golden haired...

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              The closest thing my world has to
              royalty...

                                                           12.



INCLUDE -- Edward and Bella (now wearing a green dress).
She studies the painting - the largest on a wall crowded
with pictures. The other walls are towering bookshelves.

                          EDWARD
              Francesco Solimena painted this; he
              often depicted the Volturi as Gods.

Bella examines the golden haired "God."

                          BELLA
              Is that... Carlisle?                                

                          EDWARD
              Yes. He lived with them for a few                   
              decades. He describes them as very                  
              refined - for killers.

PUSH IN ON THE PAINTING, THE FOURSOME

Their features begin to fill in, become real - THEY COME TO
LIFE in the painting, turning to leave the balcony through
an archway. We FOLLOW THEM into --

INT. A CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

It's centuries old, its marble cracked and weathered. The         
open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of            
light. The room is empty but for three large wooden chairs        
and half a dozen VAMPIRES in elegant 18th century attire.

                          EDWARD (V.O.)                           
              The Volturi are also what you might                 
              call enforcers.                                     

                         BELLA (V.O.)                             
              Of what?                                            
                          EDWARD (V.O.)                           
              The only rule they have: to keep                    
              secret the existence of our kind.                   

Two of the Volturi, MARCUS and CAIUS, take their seats,           
Carlisle stands beside them. ARO moves to the center of the       
room where we REVEAL --                                           

A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to       
the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either           
side of the Rogue's face. Compassion?                             

                                                           13.



                          EDWARD (V.O.)
              We don't make spectacles of ourselves,
              or kill conspicuously, unless we want               
              to die.

Aro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF.      
Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either           
side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and        
tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the           
Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away...                

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

-- as Bella spins on Edward --

                          BELLA
              Don't even -- talk about that. You                  
              can't let anyone hurt you. The                      
              Volturi or anyone else.                             

                          EDWARD                                  
                   (sees she's worried)                           
              Who else would hurt me?                             

                          BELLA                                   
              You said there were more dangerous                  
              things out there than you. And I know
              you have at least one enemy --

OFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS:

-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread-        
locked LAURENT (from "Twilight")

-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes,
feral, vicious grin (from "Twilight")

                          BELLA (O.S.)
              You said she'd come after you for
              killing her mate.

BACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD

                          EDWARD
              Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice                  
              will see her coming. And she won't win.

Bella looks up at him, pained.

                          BELLA
              I hate that I can't protect you.

He laughs, amused.   She's decidedly not.                         

                                                            14.



                           BELLA
               That was me being serious.

                           EDWARD
                    (kissing her face)
               I know. But you do protect me...                    
                    (kisses her nose)
               From boredom...                                     
                    (kisses her lips)
               And loneliness...                                   
                    (in between kisses)
               You give me a reason to stay... un-                 
               dead. But it's... my job; to protect                
               you...                                              

-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind --
                           EDWARD
               ... from everyone but my sister.

-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in.

                           ALICE
               It's time it's time it's time!

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Alice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then        
skips down the stairs. They look down into --

THE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled
crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and
Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful.

Bella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to --

THE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly.
                           CARLISLE
               Sorry about all this.   We tried to
               rein Alice in.

                           ESME
               Like that's even possible.   Happy
               birthday, Bella.

FLASH!   Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them.

                           ALICE
                    (re: camera)
               Found it in your bag.   Mind?

Emmett moves to Edward's side.   Nudges him.

                                                              15.



                          EMMETT
              Dating an older woman.    Hot.

Bella caught that.    Edward elbows him sharply to shut up.

                           EMMETT
              What?

Rosalie steps up.    Shoves a silver package at Bella.

                          ROSALIE
              It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

She walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.     She sees Jasper
across the room. They wave to each other.
                          ALICE
                   (aims the camera)
              Show me the love!

Edward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into
one another's eyes. FLASH!

                          ALICE
              For your scrapbook.    Now open your
              presents!

Alice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately             
wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates.

                          BELLA
              Alice, I'm the only one who even eats
              cake. That thing could feed fifty.

                          ALICE
              Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's
              from Emmett.
The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no
fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find
an empty car-radio box.

                          BELLA
              Um... thanks?

                          EMMETT
              Already installed it in your truck.

                          EDWARD
              Finally, a decent sound system in that
              piece of --

                                                            16.



                          BELLA
              No hating on the truck.     Thank you,               
              Emmett.

                           ALICE
              Open mine.

Alice hands her a box.   Bella starts to open it, but --

                          BELLA
              Ouch - paper cut.

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood
appears.

Bella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing,            
grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as --                            

BELLA'S POV - JASPER lunges toward her!    Teeth bared, eyes       
beyond reason --                                                   

-- Edward FLINGS Bella behind his own body, causing her to
CRASH into the table, plates shattering as --

-- Jasper SLAMS into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding.

-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting         
the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella.         

-- Emmett and Carlisle TACKLE Jasper from the side, dragging       
him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down --                  

                          ALICE
                   (soothingly)
              Jaz... shhh --

... But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella.
Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the
overwhelming scent --

ON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks
at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards;
bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up --

BELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION)

All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare
down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly
ravenous vampires...

SLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's
side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and
stands between her and the others.

                                                           17.



                          CARLISLE
              Emmett, get Jasper out of here.                     
                   (no response)
              Emmett.

Emmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the
snarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits
with the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic --              

                          ALICE                                   
              I'm sorry, I... can't...                            

She slips out the door.   Edward's still on guard as Carlisle     
examines Bella's arm.

                          CARLISLE
              I'll have to stitch this up.

                          EDWARD
              I'll carry her to the kitchen.

He moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood.

                          CARLISLE
              I'll take care of her, Edward.
                   (Edward doesn't move)
              Check on Jasper. Go.                                

Edward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing
Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But
just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's
agonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               

Bella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her           
blood as he removes glass shards from her arm. He drops one       
into a bowl; PLINK. She tries not to look at the blood.           
                          BELLA                                   
              I sure can kill a party.                            

                          CARLISLE                                
              It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't                  
              been away from human blood as long as               
              the rest of us.                                     

                          BELLA                                   
              Seems like you're the only one it                   
              doesn't effect.                                     

                          CARLISLE                                
              Centuries of practice.                              

                                                         18.



                          BELLA                                 
              Did you ever think of... living                   
              differently?                                      

                            CARLISLE                            
              I enjoy   my work too much. Helping               
              people,   saving lives. I'm hoping                
              there's   a point to my existence, even           
              if I am   damned.                                 

                            BELLA                               
              Damned?    You're not damned.                     

                          CARLISLE                              
              Then you and I agree. But Edward                  
              doesn't believe there's an afterlife              
              for our kind.                                     
                   (looking at her)                             
              He thinks we've lost our souls.                   

                          BELLA                                 
                   (realizing)                                  
              That's why he won't... He thinks he'd             
              be damning me.                                    

                          CARLISLE (CONT'D)                     
              If you believed as he did, would you              
              risk it?                                          

Off Bella, no, not ever...                                      

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                      

A large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard.     
Edward drives in silence. Bella studies him. Finally --         

                          BELLA                                 
              Say something.                                    
                          EDWARD                                
              What do you want me to say?                       

                          BELLA                                 
              That I'm a klutz. That I should have              
              been more careful --                              

                          EDWARD                                
              You got a paper cut. Normal people                
              get paper cuts. And a normal                      
              boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into            
              a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend             
              wouldn't have had to fight the urge to            
              kill you --                                       

                                                         19.



                           BELLA                                
              Stop.   I don't want normal, I want               
              you.                                              

Edward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into --

The truck stops.   Beat.                                        

                          BELLA                                 
              You can't protect me from everything -            
              something's going to separate us --               
              accident, illness, old age... as long
              as I'm human...
                          EDWARD
                    (appalled)
              That's your solution?   My ending your            
              life?

                          BELLA
              Your giving me forever.                           

He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented.     
She reaches for his hand --                                     

                          BELLA                                 
              Carlisle told me how you feel, about              
              my soul, but I don't believe that --              

-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers.                     

                          EDWARD                                
              You should go in. It's late.                      

He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side       
door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -       
he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.         

                          BELLA                                 
              I'll leave my window open for you.

                          EDWARD
                   (quietly)                                    
              I won't be coming back.   Not tonight.            

                          BELLA                                 
              Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's           
              still my birthday.                                
                   (off his nod)                                
              Kiss me?                                          

                                                           20.



He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins               
carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with      
an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.                    

Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks         
off into the night. Off Bella...                                  

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out. It's the pic Alice
took of Bella and Edward's embrace. Bella, troubled, puts
it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

"Romeo and Juliet" lessons are on the board. Everyone's
scribbling essays. Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty --

FLASHPOP TO -- (previous scene in truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S          
EYES, hard, turning away from her...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                                

Bella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke,
throw things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward.         

FLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND          
moving away from hers...

BACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to --               

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        

PAN the photos on the wall. INCLUDE EDWARD who studies            
them, his expression grim. He looks down at Bella's               
SCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it          
out, takes a closer look...                                       
EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                          

ON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls         
into the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house         
but stops, relief washing over her --

                           BELLA
              Edward.   You're here.

He stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows
when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask.

                          EDWARD
              Walk with me?

                                                        21.



Edward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets
him guide her toward the woods...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Edward stops by a fallen tree.        Turns to Bella.

                          EDWARD
              We need to leave Forks.                          

                             BELLA                             
              What?   Why?                                     

                          EDWARD
              It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be             
              ten years older than he looks; people
              will start noticing.

                          BELLA
              But... when?

                             EDWARD
              Now.                                             

Bella reels, trying to take this in.       Finally --          

                          BELLA                                
              I'll have to think of something to               
              tell Charlie, but I can be ready --              

                           EDWARD                              
              Not you.   Us.                                   

                          BELLA                                
                   (stunned)
              What? -- no -- Edward, what happened             
              with Jasper - that was nothing.                  
                          EDWARD                               
              Nothing compared to what could happen.           
              You don't belong in my world.                    

                          BELLA
              -- I belong with you --

                          EDWARD
              -- You don't --

                          BELLA
              -- I'm coming --

                          EDWARD
              I don't want you to come!

                                                                22.



Bella is stung, as if slapped.

                          BELLA                                        
              You don't... want me.                                    

                          EDWARD                                       
              No.                                                      

She steps back.   Trying to understand this.                           

                          EDWARD                                       
              I'd like to ask one favor though.                        

                         BELLA                                         
                   (looks up, hopeful)                                 
              Anything.                                                
                          EDWARD                                       
              Don't do anything stupid or reckless --                  
              do you understand?                                       
                   (adding)                                            
              ... for Charlie's sake. Just... take                     
              care of yourself.                                        

                          BELLA                                        
              I... yes... I will.                                      

He softens ever-so-slightly.                                           

                          EDWARD                                       
              Don't worry. You're human. Time                          
              heals all wounds for your kind.
              Particularly if you're not reminded.                     

Desperation wells up in her, overwhelming dignity.                     

                          BELLA                                        
              No, this is - don't do this.     Please.                 
He sees she won't let go easily.    Takes a breath.       His face     
turns cold again.                                                      

                          EDWARD                                       
              Try to understand. Every second with                     
              you is about restraint. You're too                       
              fragile. I'm tired of pretending to                      
              be something I'm not. Reining myself                     
              in so I can be with a human.                             

                          BELLA                                        
              Then take my soul. I don't care!        I                
              don't want it without you --                             

                                                               23.



                          EDWARD                                      
                   (sharply)                                          
              -- You're not good for me, Bella.                       

Bella looks at him.   His hard face.   His resolve.                   

                          EDWARD                                      
              I've let it go on too long.     I'm
              sorry.                                                  

Tears sting Bella's eyes. This can't be happening. He
steps forward... kisses her forehead. She closes her eyes.

                          EDWARD
              I promise, it will be like I never                      
              existed. Goodbye, Bella.                                
And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing
this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.                     

By the time she opens her eyes - he's gone.    She spins --           

                           BELLA
              -- Wait --

She SEES a LEAF FLITTERING to the ground where he grazed a            
branch; the only indication of his direction. She hurries             
down the path, then runs --                                           

                           BELLA
              Edward?!

-- and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods...

A SERIES OF QUICK, SURREAL SHOTS - TIME LAPSING

Bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her
opening dream. It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into  
night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS --                 

BELLA TRIPS. Falls to the damp forest floor.        She looks up,     
the trees spinning around her...                                      

STAY ON BELLA - NIGHT - AS HOURS PASS                                 

She remains on the ground. Curls into a ball.       Darkness          
shrouding her. Devastation paralyzing her.                            

ECU ON HER FACE - numb. HEAR the faint sound of her name              
being called in the distance. A search party. She's too               
wrecked to respond.

Rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it....                      

                                                            24.



SERIES OF SCENES END ON -- BELLA, lying there, dazed. She
begins to HEAR an animal SNUFFLING. It gets closer. It
sounds large. Scary. Then she hears a whisper --

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              Move, Bella.

She lifts her head, looks for Edward... but SEES something         
else instead --

BELLA'S POV - A DARK SHAPE, huge, black. Nearing. Its EYES
reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage.

Bella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of
trees. She squeezes between them. Breathing hard. She
closes her eyes, trying to disappear...                            
INT. WOODS - LATER NIGHT                                           

Bella's eyes open to find herself FLOATING several feet
above the ground. Trees pass by. She's being carried...

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Half the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that
includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black.

Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with
BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER,
46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face).

                          CHARLIE
              I'll call the Cullens again. Her note
              said she and Edward went for a walk.

                          BILLY
              They left town, Charlie.
                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job
              somewhere else.

Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder.                

                          HARRY CLEARWATER                         
              We'll find her, Charlie.                             

Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends.                

                           JACOB
              Charlie!                                             

Charlie spins to where Jacob points --

                                                          25.



THEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS

SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with       
cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella.       

                          BILLY
              It's Sam Uley. He found her.

Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life.
He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms.

                          CHARLIE
              Thank you, Sam. Thank God.

Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and      
Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs      
away, avoiding any accolades.

ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with      
worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he          
turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable,
quickly looks away.

ON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house --          

                          CHARLIE
              What were you thinking, Baby?   Why
              were you out there?

                          BELLA
              He's... gone.                                      

Off her as Charlie carries her inside --                         

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     

OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps     
her in blankets...                                               
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA                                   

She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed.       
Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In         
various different arrangements. Meanwhile...                     

A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing      
everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed,        
higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and       
begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness...       

                                                           26.



EXT.   BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY - A MONTH LATER

The leaves have turned red and orange.    SEE a FIGURE in the     
upstairs window --                                                

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        

Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face             
blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE         
WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her --                 

OCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or-            
treating. DISSOLVE INTO...                                        

NOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie
a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern...      
WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare...              

DECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house...    
worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains                
unchanged...                                                      

                           BELLA (V.O.)                           
               Dear Mom... I'm...
                    (beat)
               ... lost...

PAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone        
are all traces of Edward...

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               Edward took everything with him.
               Including my life. He promised it                  
               would be like he never existed...

... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of
Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone.
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY

BELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee.

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               ... But I need to know he did.

A SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER:

-- INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.    Charlie
watches her, concerned.

                                                         27.



                          BELLA (V.O.)
              It's like a huge hole has been punched
              through my chest...

-- INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor.     

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But the pain is my only reminder that
              he was real... that they all were...

-- INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Lunch. Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead. SEE
Jessica, Eric, Angela and Mike, watching her with concern.
Talking about her. She doesn't notice.

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              I miss them. Especially Alice...

EXT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

A one-story contemporary home, surrounded by snowy, barren
land and woods. Through a LARGE PICTURE WINDOW we SEE Alice
and Carlisle, arguing inside --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But I'm sure it's better for them, not
              having me around...

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME (CONTINOUS) - DAY

Alice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on. Esme
desolate; Emmett blank. He sits next to Rosalie who seems
almost irritated. Jasper isolates himself in a corner.

                           CARLISLE
              No.   We promised Edward.

                          ALICE
              But she won't do well without us. I get           
              flashes of her, but they're unclear --            

                          ROSALIE
              Forget her, let's drag Edward home.               

                          ESME
              He'll come back when he's ready.                  
              After Bella moves on.                             

                                                            28.



                          CARLISLE                                 
              Yes. When she's living her life, safe                
              from danger --                                       

                          JASPER
                   (with self-contempt)
              You mean safe from us.

Alice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly.

                          ROSALIE
                   (pointedly to Alice)
              And when will that be?

                          EMMETT
              Can you see him, Alice?                              
They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes,             
trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as --

                          ALICE
              The only decision he's made...

                                                    SMASH TO:

EXT. SOUTH AMERICA - ANDES (ALICE'S VISION) - DAY                  

(Visuals are jumpy, unclear) START HIGH ON A MOUNTAINTOP in        
the middle of nowhere. SWOOP DOWN to its peak on which we          
find EDWARD. Standing still, face agonized.                        

                          ALICE (O.S.)                             
              ... is to be alone...                                

-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to            
outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a        
CLIFF; a RAVINE hundreds of feet below --                          
Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he           
LEAPS off the cliff, FLOATING, but the pain stays with him --      

ON EDWARD'S FEET landing hard on the other side of the             
ravine - as they hit ground we --                                  

                                                SMASH BACK TO:     

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGERS

-- as they hit computer keys --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Time passes. Every tick that goes
              by... aches...

                                                            29.



INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

INCLUDE BELLA'S COMPUTER SCREEN, as she types...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise...

Bella stops. A beat as she stares at her own words.   Then
she hits "select all" and "delete" --

ON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: "Hi Mom,
things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends.
Stop worrying. I'm fine."

Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears.
Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out             
desolately. PUSH PAST HER OUTSIDE...                               

AN UNKNOWN POV FROM THE WOODS - ON BELLA IN THE WINDOW

-- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing
trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who
also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles.           

                          CHARLIE
              It's about time you got rid of those,
              Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared
              on the highway.

                          BOB
              Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the
              garbage truck hauls `em off, you and
              my wife can rest easy.
                    (starts off, but stops)
              Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear                
              problem? Folks are saying they're                    
              huge.                                                

                          CHARLIE
                   (distracted)
              That's just... talk...                               

-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down.
Bob sees her, too --

                          BOB
              How you doin' there, Bella?

                                                            30.



Bella, in her own world, doesn't respond.   Bob gives Charlie
an understanding shrug and heads off.

ON BELLA as she opens her truck door.   Suddenly, it gets
slammed shut again by Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
               That's it.

                           BELLA
               That's what?

                           CHARLIE
               You're going to Jacksonville to live
               with your mother.
                              BELLA
               What?   Why?

                           CHARLIE
               I just - don't know what to do any                  
               more. You don't act like someone left               
               you; more like someone died.

She looks away.   That's how it feels to her.

                           BELLA
               I'm not leaving Forks.

                           CHARLIE
               Bells, the bastard's not coming back.

She nods.   Knows this all too well.                               

                           CHARLIE                                 
               It's not normal, this behavior. And                 
               frankly, it's scaring the hell outta
               me, and your mother.                                
                    (gentler)
               Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some
               new friends.

                           BELLA
               I like my old friends.

                           CHARLIE
               You never even see them anymore.

                           BELLA
               I do, too. In fact, I'm... um...
               Jessica and I are going to Port
               Angeles tomorrow. Shopping.

                                                          31.



                          CHARLIE
                   (suspicious)
              You hate shopping.

                          BELLA
              That's how good a friend I am.

                         CHARLIE
                   (somewhat appeased)
              Alright. Shopping.

                          BELLA (PRE-LAP)
              Hi Jessica, it's Bella...

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY
Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course).

                          BELLA
              ... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance
              you feel like shopping tomorrow?

EXT. PORT ANGELES - MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                        

Bella and Jessica exit the theater.   A MARQUEE behind them      
bears the title of a ZOMBIE film.                                

                          BELLA                                  
              I don't get why are there so many                  
              zombie movies.                                     

                          JESSICA                                
              It's, like, a metaphor? For crass                  
              consumerism or something.                          

Bella glances at her.                                            

                          JESSICA                                
              Not that you'd know anything about                 
              consuming. You didn't buy anything                 
              today.                                             

                          BELLA
              I bought something.

                          JESSICA
              Socks don't count. `Course, I was
              surprised you even called.

                          BELLA
              I've been kind of... out of it.

                                                            32.



                          JESSICA
              Kind of? I mean, at first I was
              worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's
              still bumming? It's not like I wasn't
              going through things, too. Like Mike
              deciding he wanted to "just be friends?"
              That was really hard and --

                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
              How `bout a ride, girls?

As Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS --

BELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, "ONE EYED PETE'S" (SLOW MOTION)

-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their           
motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces.

OFF BELLA WE SMASH TO --

FLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS ("Twilight");
Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down --

BACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as
she stares at the foursome across the street...

Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear --

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              Move, Bella.

She turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it
seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes          
clear when --

Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and
TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN --
                           JESSICA
              Come on.

                          BELLA
              I know them... I think...                             

                          JESSICA
              Can we just go --

Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off.

                          BELLA
              I want to see something.

                                                             33.



Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the
street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn.

                          GUY #1
              Alright, we got a taker.

The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time.           
She stops.

                          EDWARD
              Turn around, Bella.     This is                       
              dangerous.                                            

But when she steps backward, he fades. Testing her
hallucination, she strides forward again -- Edward's
apparition reappears, strides alongside her --
                             EDWARD
              Stop.   Now.

She's almost smiling as she reaches the Guys, finally able
to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing --

                          BELLA
              ... You're not them.                                  

And with that.... Edward disappears.

                          GUY #1
              We'll be whoever you want, honey.

Guy #2 pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle.

                          GUY #2
              Ready for a thrill ride?

GUY #2 extends his hand to help her onto the bike.     She          
hesitates.                                                          
                             EDWARD (O.S.)                          
              Walk away.     Go.                                    

Edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike.          
Bella looks at him with determination -- then climbs on to          
the back of the bike --                                             

                          BELLA                                     
              I can break promises, too.                            

                         GUY #2                                     
                   (confused)                                       
              ... Okay.                                             

                                                              34.



                          JESSICA                                    
              Bella!

The bike LURCHES forward, going way too fast. As the wind            
blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a            
mistake --                                                           

                          BELLA                                      
              ... Wait                                               

Guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster --            

BELLA'S POV - DIRECTLY AHEAD                                         

Edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present,         
more clear than ever. The bike's headlight illuminates him,          
racing toward him --                                                 

                          BELLA                                      
              Stop - stop! - STOP!                                   

The bike abruptly pulls up short.                                    

                          GUY #2                                     
              Hey, I didn't force nothing on you.                    

Bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process.    Edward is          
gone.                                                                

The four Guys then REV their bikes and PEEL out.    Bella            
watches them go as Jessica storms up.

                          JESSICA
              What the hell is wrong with you?!

                          BELLA
                   (almost to herself)
              I... saw something.                                    
                           JESSICA                                   
              You.   Are insane. Or suicidal.                        

                          BELLA                                      
                   (trying to figure it out)                         
              The more dangerous... the more real it                 
              was.                                                   

                          JESSICA
              So, what, you're like an adrenaline
              junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie-
              jumping. Don't be a complete freak.

                                                            35.



An angry Jessica charges off. Bella watches the motorcycles
disappear down the street as --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              He wasn't real. I knew that. I                       
              didn't care. I needed to see him. If                 
              danger's what it took, that's what I'd               
              find.                                                

Off Bella, determination settling into her face...

EXT. JACOB BLACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella pulls up in her truck, a tarp covering something big
in the back. Jacob comes out of the house. A huge grin.
                          JACOB
              Bella!

Bella hops out, Jacob gives her a hug.   Bella's surprised by
his affection, but doesn't mind.

                          JACOB
              `Bout time you came by.

                          BELLA
              I brought you something.

Bella pulls the tarp back, revealing - her neighbor's two
dilapidated, rusting MOTORCYCLES.

                          JACOB
              Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

                          BELLA
              I rescued them from the dump. They'd
              cost more than they're worth to fix...
              unless one had a mechanic-type friend.
                          JACOB
              Me, being the mechanic-type friend?
                   (off her shrug)
              Since when are you into motorcycles?

                          BELLA
              Recently.

                          JACOB
                   (studying the bikes)
              The parts alone will be pricey.

                          BELLA
              I have a college fund I can dig into.

                                                            36.



                          JACOB
              Charlie's gonna love that.                           

                          BELLA
              Charlie won't know.                                  

                          JACOB
              Wow. Lying to Dad. Blowing through                   
              college money. Repairing dangerous                   
              machines - that I'm guessing you'll
              want to ride?

                          BELLA
              I really get it if you think this is
              stupid and reckless.
                          JACOB
              Oh it's totally stupid and reckless.
                   (leans closer, grins)                           
              When do we start?

Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a
while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the
truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought       
Bella back to life. But --

UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE

-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes           
into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover --

EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - SAM ULEY - SAME

Next to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All
three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's
unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in
their eyes, the danger.
Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink
soundlessly into the darkness of the woods...

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Two hikers, NATE and TIM, 20's, as they tromp through the
shadowy, mist-laden woods. Tim studies his IPhone GPS --

                          TIM
              We're going the wrong way.

                           NATE
              Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery.

                                                              37.



                           TIM
                    (slapping a mosquito)
               And the West Nile virus.

Tim hears a RUSTLE.    Stops.

                           TIM
               You hear that?

                           NATE
               If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd
               have brought my grandma.

                           TIM
               Could be one of those giant bears.
                           NATE
               There are no giant --

RUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction,
another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind,
from in front. It's either more than one creature or it's
moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified.

                           TIM
               What the hell is that?!

                           NATE
               I don't know!

The guys, faced away from one another, search the trees.
STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE. Beat.

                           TIM
               Think it's gone?

No answer.   He turns to find that Nate has vanished.
                            TIM
               Nate?   Nate!?

Nothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.       And intensifies.

Tim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too
scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath
ragged, he looks over his shoulder --

TIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening
foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder --  

TIM'S POV - UP AHEAD THROUGH THE TREES - THE HIGHWAY

A couple cars pass.    Civilization.   Safety.   Tim races for it --

                                                           38.



EXT. HIGHWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement,       
he`s going to escape --                                           

BAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural             
angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing         
but a disturbing silence...                                       

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - ANOTHER DAY

Motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets.    Jacob moves
among them excitedly, piecing them together.    Bella watches.
                          BELLA
              If we're going to be working on this
              every day, we should probably include
              some homework. Don't want the Dads to
              think I'm a bad influence on you.

                          JACOB
              You influence me?     Please.

                          BELLA
              I am older than you.

                          JACOB
              Age ain't nothin' but a number.

                          BELLA
              And I convinced you to secretly build
              us two-wheeled death machines.

                          JACOB
                   (sudden mock-horror)
              God, you're right, you're like Satan --
                          QUIL (O.S.)
              Yo, Jake, you in there?

Bella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes.

                          JACOB
              It's cool, it's just my boys.

QUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short,
stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and
laid back, with chin-length black hair.

                          EMBRY
              Hey, Jake --

                                                               39.



They stop when they see Bella.        The two guys share a smile.

                          JACOB
              Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's
              Quil and Embry.

                          QUIL
              So the bike building story is true.

                          BELLA
              Taught him everything he knows.

                          QUIL
              What about the part where you're his                    
              girlfriend?                                             
                          BELLA
              Oh, we're just friends.

                              EMBRY                                   
              Ooh.    Burn.

                          JACOB
                   (scrambling)
              I said she's a girl and a friend.

                          QUIL
              Embry, you remember him making that
              distinction?

                              EMBRY
              Nope.

Bella rescues Jacob --

                          BELLA
              So I guess you guys have girlfriends.
                         JACOB
                   (laughs loudly)
              Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.

Embry chuckles, as well.

                          QUIL
              Yeah, that's still a riot. You want
              funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

Quil makes a run at him, he dodges; a playful scuffle ensues.
Embry, amused, saunters over to Bella.

                          EMBRY
              I got five bucks on Quil.

                                                           40.



                           BELLA
              You're on.

The scuffle continues.   Off Bella, enjoying them...

A SERIES OF SCENES...                                             

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL DAYS             

The bikes begin to take shape, the parts on the blanket thin      
out.                                                              

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              I never forgot my reason for doing                  
              what I was doing...                                 
Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer            
himself with a pipe. She laughs.                                  

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              But being with Jacob was a bigger perk              
              than I expected...                                  

He constantly touches her, playful, affectionate. It's            
effortless in contrast to Edward's intense restraint. We          
can see her spirits beginning to lift.                            

EXT. JACOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT                                       

Bella and Jacob exit, make their way across the yard to her       
truck. Bella seems lighter, happier than before.                  

                          JACOB
              Quil keeps asking to come over. I                   
              think he likes you a little too much.               

                          BELLA
              Tell him I'm not into the cougar                    
              thing.

                          JACOB
              What is it with you and age? I mean,                
              that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem              
              to... bother you.                                   

He instantly regrets saying Edward's name as he sees it           
crush her spirits. Off Bella, retreating into herself...          

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              Not even Jacob could keep away the                  
              nightmares...

                                                         41.



EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (NIGHTMARE)

Bella TEARS through the forest, searching desperately. Then
she turns -- finds Edward a few yards away, his face cold.      
She steps toward him -- but he BOLTS backward, suddenly
twenty yards away --

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               ... the terror, the loneliness.

-- he rapidly retreats further until he disappears, leaving
Bella utterly alone, darkness closing in on her...

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bella SCREAMS in her sleep. The light turns on and Charlie      
hurries to her side, gently shaking her awake.                  

                           CHARLIE                              
               You're alright, Bells.   You're okay.            

Her eyes open, tears streaming down her cheeks. He doesn't      
quite know what to do, so hands her a glass of water from       
her bedside table. She sits up, sips. He pulls the              
dreamcatcher from her bedpost.                                  

                           CHARLIE                              
               This thing's not working very well.              

                           BELLA                                
               It's... not as bad as it was.                    

                           CHARLIE                              
               Yeah right.                                      
                    (beat)                                      
               I know what it's like, you know. When            
               your mom left me. I had a hell of a              
               time. Imagined doing all kinds of                
               crazy things, just to stop the pain.             

She avoids his look.                                            

                           CHARLIE                              
               But hanging out with Jacob seems to              
               help get your mind off... things.                

                           BELLA                                
               He's been keeping me afloat.                     

                           CHARLIE                              
               That's good. He's a good guy.                    

Off Bella...                                                    

                                                          42.



INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY                                         

Bella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun.
He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft.

                          JACOB
              We got lucky at the dump. You know
              how much a new crankshaft goes for?

                          BELLA
              Sure, I spend all my free time on
              crankshaft-dot-com.

                          JACOB
              I think that's a porn site.
                   (then)                                        
              These bikes are gonna be rolling soon.             
              Where should we ride first?

                          BELLA                                  
              Someplace sunny.                                   

                          JACOB
              Like there's any place sunny around                
              here.                                              

                          BELLA
              I know a place above the cloud line --             

The second she says it, she regrets it -- off her --

FLASHPOP TO - THE MEADOW, Bella lying in the grass with          
Edward ("Twilight"), flowers surrounding them.                   

                          JACOB (O.S.)
              Where is it?

BACK ON BELLA - her face falls.
                          BELLA
              Actually, it's... too hard to get to.              

He brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue.

                          JACOB
              So we'll find our sunny spot, right?               

She smiles, grateful. Then she looks out the window at the
cliffs... and notices --

                                                          43.



BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE BY THE CLIFF

FOUR MEN stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared,
Paul, and a fourth). They wear nothing but cut-off shorts.
They push each other, rough-housing.

                          BELLA
              Isn't that... Sam Uley?

                          JACOB
                   (bitter)                                      
              And his cult.

Suddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the
cliff! BELLA SLAMS on the brakes. Jumps out of the truck --
Jacob climbs out after her --
                           BELLA
              Oh my God!   Stop them! --

EXT. LA PUSH CLIFFS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella runs toward them.   But Jacob's laughter slows her.

                          JACOB
              They're not really fighting, Bella.                
              They're cliff diving.

                          BELLA
              What, on purpose?

                          JACOB
              Scary as hell, but a total rush.

BELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and           
FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down.

Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for      
Edward.                                                          

                          JACOB
              Most of us jump from lower down.

                          BELLA
              Think I could?

                          JACOB
              Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?

                          BELLA
              You said it was a rush.

                                                         44.



                          JACOB
              Maybe on a warmer day. And not from
              the top. We'll leave the showing off
              to Sam and his disciples.

There's that bitter edge again.   She looks at him.             

                          BELLA
              You don't like them.

                          JACOB
              They think they run this place.   Acting
              all bad ass, calling themselves
              "protectors."

                          BELLA
              What are they protecting?

                          JACOB
              The tribe, the land, their right to be
              jerks. Embry used to call them hall
              monitors on steroids; now look at him.

Bella looks closer, SEES the fourth guy is Embry, hair now
shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. It
pains Jacob to see him.

                          BELLA
              That's Embry? I didn't recognize him.             
              What happened to him?                             

                          JACOB
              He missed some school - then, out of
              nowhere, he's following Sam around.
              Same thing happened with Paul and
              Jared. They weren't even friends, now
              Sam owns them.
                   (beat)                                       
              Sam keeps giving me this look, like               
              he's waiting for me or something; it's            
              kinda freaking me out.                            

                          BELLA
              Maybe you should just avoid them.

                          JACOB
              I try but...                                      

She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly.    

                           BELLA
              Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my
              Dad.   Or you can come stay with us.

                                                         45.



                          JACOB
              Thanks.
                   (beat, holding her)
              If this is how you're going to react,
              I'll freak out more often.

Bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully
shoving him. As they head to the truck, Bella looks back --

BELLA'S POV - ON SAM

-- but now he's looking directly at her. Then he turns and
DIVES over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
Bella carries her tray to an empty table, but looks over at
Mike, Angela, Jessica and Eric. Bella takes a breath, then
casually joins them. They take note, but keep talking.

                          JESSICA
              I'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu.

                          ANGELA
              It's going around. My sister was so
              sick she couldn't come on our hike
              this weekend... so she didn't see it.

                          ERIC                                  
                   (sotto)                                      
              Ang, maybe you should keep that to                
              yourself --                                       

                          ANGELA                                
              We saw something, Eric.                           

                          ERIC                                  
              I believe you.                                    
                          JESSICA                               
              No he doesn't. He's just trying to                
              get lucky.                                        

                          ERIC                                  
                   (suddenly hopeful)                           
              Is that an option?                                

                          ANGELA                                
                   (ignoring him)                               
              It was jet black and huge; on all                 
              fours it was still taller than a                  
              person. A bear maybe.                             

                                                             46.



                             JESSICA                                
                 Or Big Foot.                                       

                             MIKE                                   
                 Or an alien. Lucky you didn't get                  
                 probed.

                             ANGELA
                      (quietly)                                     
                 ... We saw it.

She's serious.    And a little scared.   Bella see that.            

                             BELLA
                 You're not the only one.
Everyone stares.    Did Bella just speak?

                             BELLA
                 My dad's been getting reports at the
                 sheriff's station. A couple hikers
                 went missing. People are scared.

Now everyone's chilled.

                             MIKE
                 I did hear some guy talking about it
                 at the store.                                      

                             ERIC                                   
                 Last time you clowns doubt my                      
                 girlfriend.                                        

As they continue, Angela mouths "thanks" to Bella. They             
share a smile and join in, Bella becoming part of the group.

                                                        CUT TO:
ECU ON JACOB AND BELLA'S FACES

-- just inches apart.

                             JACOB
                 You look scared.

                            BELLA
                 I'm not.

She's lying. PULL BACK to see she's straddling the now
completed motorcycle. Jacob stands next to her, holding the
bike up. There's an intimacy to their proximity. INCLUDE --

                                                            47.



EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

The bike is aimed down a dirt road.     Jacob runs through the     
instructions:

                          JACOB
               Brake?
                    (she taps it)
               Clutch?
                    (she squeezes it)
               Right. Gas?
                    (she grips it)
               You ready?

Bella nods.   Jacob grins... then KICK-STARTS the bike.
                           JACOB
               Slowly... release the clutch.

She does... the bike moves forward an inch -- Jacob
cautiously steps back. She moves forward another inch --

                             EDWARD (O.S.)
               Stop.

Bella turns to find the apparition of EDWARD standing next
to her. Her hand slips off the clutch, the bike BUCKS and
falls on top of her. Jacob quickly lifts it off her as the         
apparition of Edward disappears.

                            JACOB
               You okay?   Bruises, breaks -- ?                    

                           BELLA
               I'm going again.

                           JACOB
               I'm not sure that's a good --
Bella quickly rises and hops back on.

                           JACOB
               Guess we're going again. Now what are
               you going to do with the clutch?

                             BELLA
               Release it.    Slowly.

Jacob nods. Then kick-starts the bike again. She releases
the clutch and moves forward. Slowly at first -- EDWARD
reappears at her side, glowering.

                                                          48.



She keeps going, a little faster. EDWARD appears on her left     
now; she passes him. He reappears ahead; she passes.

ON BELLA'S FACE as the wind flings her hair back. She
gathers speed... and for a moment, experiences pure freedom,
exhilaration... then she sees Edward standing at the curve
in the road ahead, and realizes --

                          BELLA
                   (yelling to Jacob)
              I don't -- how do I turn!?

                           JACOB
              Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!

Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank,
goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees.

As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up.

                          JACOB
              What, are you training for the X-games?

She looks around for Edward.   He's gone.

                          BELLA
              I want to go again.

                          JACOB
              Forget it. I'm revoking your                       
              motorcycle privileges. Man, look at                
              your head.                                         

Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his          
shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away --                          

                          BELLA                                  
              God, I'm sorry.                                    
                          JACOB                                  
              You're apologizing for bleeding?                   

                          BELLA                                  
              It doesn't... bother you?

                          JACOB
              It's just blood, Bella.

He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds
herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and        
smooth skin. He glances at her.                                  

                                                            49.



                          JACOB                                    
              What are you staring at?                             

                          BELLA                                    
              Just, you're actually... good looking.               

He's surprised; there's a moment between them.     He smiles.

                          JACOB
              How hard did you hit your head?                      

                          BELLA                                    
                   (realizing)                                     
              Oh I - yeah.                                         

He offers her a hand, helps her up.    She holds onto it,          
alarmed.                                                           

                          BELLA                                    
              Jake, you're hot.                                    

                          JACOB                                    
              Upgraded from good looking?                          

                          BELLA                                    
              No, temperature hot.                                 
                   (feels his forehead)                            
              You're burning up.                                   

                          JACOB                                    
              I feel fine.                                         

He takes her hand from his forehead.   Holds it.   She tries       
to pull it away.                                                   

                           JACOB                                   
              What?   I can't hold your hand?                      
                          BELLA                                    
              It just... means something else to you               
              than it does to me.                                  

                          JACOB                                    
              One, that's my problem. But two... we                
              have fun, you think I'm hot --                       

                          BELLA                                    
              Good looking.                                        

                          JACOB                                    
              I know you like me.                                  

                                                            50.



                          BELLA
              More than anyone.    But... that's all.

                          JACOB
              Because of Cullen?                                   

The name stings her.   He takes both her hands now.                

                          JACOB
              Look, I know what he did to you. I                   
              can see it in your face every time his               
              name comes up. But you need to know -                
              I would never, ever do that to you. I                
              promise I will never hurt you. You                   
              can count on me.                                     
                          BELLA
              I already do. You don't know how                     
              much. You're my best friend but... I                 
              don't think my feelings will change.                 

He takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps
over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath.

                          BELLA
              I'm sorry. I should've said something                
              right from the start --

                         JACOB
              No. That's not -- I just feel...                     
              weird.

                          BELLA                                    
              I told you, you have a fever.                        
              Probably that flu everyone has.                      

                          JACOB
              It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't              
              know what it is.                                     

Off Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned...                        

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY                     

Bella does homework. Charlie watches a game.     She's on          
edge. Anxious. HEAR A BEEEEP --                                    

                          BELLA (O.S.)                             
              Hey Jake. Just checking to see how                   
              you're doing. And to say I'm sorry,                  
              about, you know... how I feel and...                 
              hope the flu passes fast. Call me.                   

                                                            51.



EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - ANOTHER DAY                 

Bella climbs out of her truck, SEES the empty spot where           
Edward used to park. SEES Eric and Angela canoodling.              
Couples everywhere. She puts her head down, hurries to             
class. BEEEEP --                                                   

                          BELLA (O.S.)                             
              Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono.                
              He won't let me visit but... would you               
              call me?                                             

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                       

Bella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream.     She eyes     
the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP --                       
                           BELLA (O.S.)                            
              Me again.   I just... need to hear your              
              voice...                                             

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Bella's on the phone, leaving yet another message, her             
desperation having reached its peak. In the living room,           
Charlie and Harry check their fishing gear.                        

                           BELLA
              Jacob.   Please. Call me.                            

She hangs up, leans her forehead against the phone.     Charlie    
enters --                                                          

                          CHARLIE
              Harry and I will be back by three --

He stops when he sees her.   Puts a hand on her shoulder.          
                          CHARLIE
              It's mono, Bells.                                    

                          BELLA
              He's too sick to even call?                          

                          CHARLIE
              You just gotta wait it out.                          
                   (then)                                          
              You know, I don't have to go fishing...

                         BELLA
                   (forcing a smile)
              No, go. I'll call Jess or someone.                   

                                                            52.



                           CHARLIE
               Good. But stay here or at Jess's. No                
               hikes or anything. We're issuing a                  
               warning about those bears.                          

Off Bella's nod --                                                 

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY                                               

SERIES OF CUTS - Bella tries to navigate her way to the            
meadow. She refers to a map, a compass.                            

                           BELLA (V.O.)                            
               I was more afraid of the hole in my                 
               chest than I was of bears. Without                  
               Jacob, I needed Edward more than                    
               ever...                                             

Bella tries a trail; it doesn't look familiar.    Backtracks.      
Tries another.                                                     

                           BELLA (V.O.)                            
               ... I needed to know he existed.                    
               There was only one place I might find               
               him, or the feeling of him...                       

FLASHPOP - THE MEADOW - Edward and Bella lie in the grass          
surrounded by flowers, sunlight dappling them. They look           
lovingly into one another's eyes...                                

BACK ON BELLA - the memory and her desperation fuel her.           
Finally, she sees a clearing ahead, hurries toward it --           

EXT. THE MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                                 

-- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face          
falls. In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow         
is cold, gloomy, cloudy. And no Edward. She closes her             
eyes, trying to force Edward here.                                 

Nothing.   Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow.            

Bella sinks to her knees. Tears threatening. But then she
hears a RUSTLING noise. She turns toward it, peers into the
woods.                                                             

Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods.
She spins toward it -- nothing. Then she turns and JUMPS
when she finds --

Vampire LAURENT standing just ten yards away.    Dreadlocks,
chiseled face. Bella can't believe it.                             

                                                         53.



                            BELLA
              Laurent?

                            LAURENT                             
              Bella.                                            

She beams, realizing he's real.                                 

                            BELLA                               
              Laurent!                                          

                          LAURENT
              I must admit, I didn't expect to find
              you here.

                          BELLA
              I live here. But you - I thought you              
              were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.

                          LAURENT
              Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to
              arrange, given my association with
              James and Victoria, "The Enemy."

                          BELLA
              You tried to help us.                             

Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes
assessing her as --

                          LAURENT
              I went to visit the Cullens, but their
              house is empty. I'm surprised they
              left you behind. Weren't you sort of
              a pet of theirs?

Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.           
                          BELLA
              Um... something like that.                        

                          LAURENT
              Do the Cullens visit often?

Suddenly, EDWARD'S apparition appears between them.             

                            EDWARD
              Lie.

                            BELLA
              Absolutely.    All the time.

                                                           54.



                            EDWARD
              Lie better.

                          BELLA
              I'll tell them you stopped by.

Edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks,
then fade again). Bella tries to look relaxed.

                          BELLA
              Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?

                          LAURENT
              I don't think so. Tanya's "vegetarian"
              family was pleasant enough. But the
              dietary restrictions were difficult -
              living on nothing but animals.

Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.   She now sees his
EYES. Dark blood-red.

                          LAURENT                                    
                   (conspiratorial)
              Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel                        
              compelled to... cheat?                                 

Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him.

                          LAURENT
              But that's not why I left. I came
              back here as a favor to Victoria.

                          BELLA
              ... You're still friends.

                          LAURENT
                   (shrugs)                                          
              More or less. She asked me to get the                  
              lay of the land with the Cullens.
              Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria                   
              is quite put out with you.

                          BELLA
              That's... too bad.

                          LAURENT
              Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill
              Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
              Eye for an eye, mate for a mate.

And now Bella knows.   Terror overwhelms her.   Edward appears --

                                                          55.



                          EDWARD
              Threaten him.

                          BELLA
              Edward will know who did it.   He'll
              come after both of you.

                          LAURENT
              I don't think he will. After all, how
              much could you mean to him if he left
              you here unprotected?
                   (then)
              Victoria sent me here for information.             
              She won't be happy about my killing                
              you.                                               
                          BELLA
              No, Laurent...

                          LAURENT                                
                   (sincere)                                     
              No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm                    
              doing you a kindness. Victoria plans               
              on killing you slowly, painfully -
              whereas I'll make it very quick.
                   (inhaling)
              And you smell so... mouth watering.

He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.   Her
eyes dart around, escape is impossible --

The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking
at her with alarm...                                             

                         BELLA                                   
                   (whispering, barely                           
                    audible)                                     
              Edward. I love you.                                
Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his         
expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind       
Bella - and it terrifies him.                                    

                          LAURENT
              I... don't believe it.

He steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no
longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly
turning... to find behind her --

AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the       
woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in
its throat, sharp teeth gleaming.

                                                            56.



Bella is trapped between the two killers.    Edward whispers
in her ear --

                           EDWARD
              Don't.   Move.

The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where     
she stands, then --

FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking
the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of
different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet-            
brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched,
ready to spring.                                                   

Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET-  
BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent    
continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously --  

-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow --                              

-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her
in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS
shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding        
him before he reaches the treeline --                              

Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf          
half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent -       
he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it.              

The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes        
in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail --         

Bella doesn't stay to find out.     She RACES into the woods --    

EXT. WOODS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                                      

-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside,                
tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running --        

EXT. WOODS/ROADSIDE - DAY                                          

-- Bella DASHES out of the treeline and to her truck parked        
on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out --                        

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                           

Bella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry
Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins.

                           CHARLIE
              Bella?   What's wrong?

                                                           57.



                          BELLA
              They're not giant bears -- I saw them.
              Up in a meadow --                                   

                          CHARLIE
              Damn it, I told you not to go into the
              woods!

                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              What did you see, Bella?

                           BELLA
              Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad.

We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater
sighs ever-so-slightly.                                           
                          BELLA
              Five of them. The size of - of cars.                
              I swear. They went after -- something -
              - and I ran.

Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials --

                          CHARLIE
              Harry, can you get some men from the rez?

                           HARRY CLEARWATER
              Sure.   Yeah. I'll just --

Harry seems more concerned than gung-ho as he slips out.

                          CHARLIE
                   (into phone)
              Jerry? Put a hunting party together --
              tranq guns, large caliber shotguns --
              there's something dangerous out there.
                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              Something dangerous. Victoria.                      

Her eyes dart around the house, their vulnerability spinning      
in on her. As Charlie hangs up, goes to his gun cabinet --        

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              If she came after me, Charlie would                 
              try to protect me -- and he'd die.                  

                          CHARLIE                                 
              I've gotta go to the station.

                          BELLA                                   
              Good! -- That's good.                               

                                                            58.



                            CHARLIE                                
                You okay here? You want to come with?              

                            BELLA                                  
                Actually, I -- need to see a friend.               

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella knocks.   Then knocks again.    Finally, Billy answers.

                             BELLA
                Hi, Billy.   I know Jacob's sick but --

                            BILLY
                He's out with friends.
                            BELLA
                      (taken aback)
                Oh.

                            BILLY
                I'll let him know you came by.

Billy starts to close the door, but Bella stops him.

                            BELLA
                Wait -- he's got mono, right?    That's
                what you told my dad.

                            BILLY
                     (with compassion)
                You should go on home, Bella.

And he closes the door.      Off Bella --

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY

Bella climbs in, slams the door, pissed. Starts the truck.
Then turns it off. Deciding, she tosses the keys aside and         
sinks down into her seat to wait...

BELLA'S POV - EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - ON THE WINDOW - LATER

RAIN now pours down. Billy, inside, pulls the curtain back,
looks out at Bella with sympathy. Then closes the curtain.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - ON BELLA - SAME

Bella looks out the passenger window at Billy. Suddenly,
there's a KNOCK at the driver's window. She spins to find --

JACOB standing there. But his face is shockingly different.
His hair is cropped short. No friendly smile.

                                                           59.


No warmth in his eyes. Just a hard, brooding resentment.
Bella is taken aback. She climbs out of the truck to FIND --

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- behind Jacob stand Sam Uley, Jared, Paul and Embry.
They're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes.              

                          BELLA
              You cut your hair.

                          JACOB
              Go away.

Jacob turns away. Sam leads the group toward the house.
Jacob follows. She, and we, note his sure-footed strides;         
his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight. She grabs         
his arm.

                          BELLA
              What happened to you?

He stops, turns back. The others wait on the porch for him.
They're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her.

                          BELLA
                   (lowers her voice)
              I can help.

His face is hard as he shakes his head.   He's not talking.

                          BELLA
              Sam got to you. What did he do?

                          JACOB
              Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.

                          BELLA
              Then who?
                          JACOB
                   (bitterness seething)
              How `bout those filthy, reeking
              bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.                 

                          BELLA                                   
                   (thrown)                                       
              I... don't know what you're --                      

                          JACOB                                   
              You know exactly what I'm talking                   
              about.                                              

He's shaking, almost convulsing with anger.    She regroups.      

                                                            60.



                          BELLA                                    
              The Cullens are long gone.    How are                
              they to blame?                                       

                          JACOB                                    
              They started all this by existing.
              Goddamn leeches --

                           SAM                                     
              Jacob.

Jacob glances at Sam, who gives him a look.     Jacob takes a      
breath, trying to calm himself.                                    

                          JACOB
              I can't be friends with you anymore.
                          BELLA
              Jake, I know I hurt you. I should
              have been more up-front but -- I
              needed you, I still do. I don't know                 
              what that means yet, but if you give                 
              me time --                                           

                            JACOB
              Stop.    Don't. It's not you --                      

                          BELLA                                    
              -- "It's not you, it's me?"     God.                 

                           JACOB                                   
              It's true.   I'm not... good.                        

                          BELLA                                    
              You're wrong --                                      

                          JACOB                                    
              It doesn't matter.    This is over --                
                          BELLA
              I can't take losing my best friend, too.             

                          JACOB
              You already have --

                          BELLA
              Don't say that -- you promised --                    

                          JACOB
              Go home, Bella. Don't come back.

He practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear
inside. Off Bella, standing in the rain...

                                                           61.



INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door.       
Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness       
returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it.             

                          CHARLIE
              Billy called, said you and Jacob had a
              fight. But, hey, you guys will work
              it out, I'm sure of it.

                          BELLA
              I'm... going to change.

Bella heads upstairs.   Charlie sags, helpless.   He moves to     
the open door --                                                  
UNKNOWN POV - EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT             

-- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door...            

                                                    SMASH TO:

INT. FOREST - NIGHT

Bella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns --
finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH...      

... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS         
backward, suddenly many yards away.

                          BELLA
              Why!?                                               

He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone.

BLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny
spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair
of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud
SCREECHING NOISE --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just
a dream. But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again!                
Fingernails on her window. Bella bolts upright, looks
around for a weapon --

                         JACOB (O.S.)
                   (whisper shouting)
              Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window.

Bella cautiously moves to her window to find --

                                                              62.



EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Jacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends
with his weight. Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling --

                            BELLA
                What the hell are you doing?

                            JACOB
                Get out of the way.

He begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum.       She
realizes what he's about to attempt --

                              BELLA
                No!
He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet. Bella is stunned.           
He freezes, listening for Charlie. Nothing. A bitter, self-
satisfied grin spreads on his face. It pisses Bella off.             
He takes in her room.                                                

                            JACOB                                    
                I pictured your room more...                         
                cluttered.                                           

                            BELLA                                    
                Why are you here?                                    

                            JACOB
                I had to talk to you.   Alone.

                            BELLA                                    
                To kick me in the gut again? It was                  
                bad before, but you made it so much                  
                worse.                                               

                            JACOB                                    
                I know. And I want to explain.                       
                But... I can't.

                              BELLA
                Then leave.                                          

He stays put.   She tries to push him but he's immoveable.           

                            BELLA                                    
                You're done with me, remember?   Get.                
                Out!                                                 

                                                           63.



                          JACOB                                   
              Bella, I literally can't explain...                 

She becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular      
chest. The intimacy of their touch. She pulls away.               

                          JACOB                                   
              I broke my promise not to hurt you, I               
              know. But I'm trying to keep it now.                
              I need you to understand... even if                 
              you don't want to see me when you find              
              out --                                              

                          BELLA
              Find what out?                                      
He starts to speak -- but can't.   It's agonizing.   She sees     
he's in pain. Is concerned.                                       

                          BELLA                                   
              What's wrong?                                       

                          JACOB                                   
              I can't do it.                                      

                          BELLA                                   
              Yes, you can. I'll help you. We                     
              can... we can leave. Leave home,                    
              leave Sam.                                          

                           JACOB                                  
              It's not something I can run away                   
              from.                                               
                    (then)                                        
              I would run with you though. If I                   
              could.                                              
                    (beat, realizing)                             
              Wait. Wait, I already -- I told you.                
              You know this -- you can guess.                     

                          BELLA                                   
              I don't want to play games with you --              

                          JACOB                                   
              You have to! I can't tell you, but if               
              you remember - it was that day I ran                
              into you at the beach. I told you a                 
              story -- come on! I told you a                      
              story... about?                                     

                          BELLA                                   
              ... about... "The Cold Ones?" You                   
              said it was a stupid tribal myth.                   

                                                           64.



                         JACOB                                    
                   (pointedly)                                    
              Was it? Are the Cold Ones a myth?                   

She doesn't answer.                                               

                          JACOB                                   
              What else did I say?                                

                          BELLA                                   
              That... the tribe made a treaty with                
              them. They can't come onto your land                
              and... I don't know, I don't remember.              

                            JACOB                                 
              Try, Bella.                                         
                          BELLA
              You have to give me more. Tell me                   
              where to look. Is there something I
              should see -- ?

                          JACOB
              No, that's too dangerous --

                          BELLA
              I'll take the risk.    Jacob, show me.              

He looks at her, doesn't want to but knows it's the only          
way. Beat.                                                        

                          JACOB
              Where was the last place you saw me...              
              the way I used to be?                               

                          BELLA
              The motorcycles - that clearing in the              
              woods.                                              
He nods slowly, then turns to go.    She stops him.               

                          BELLA                                   
              Don't go. There are dangerous things                
              out there; more than you know.                      

He looks at her with a wry smile. Then pulls her into a           
hug. Her cheek against his bare chest. She takes in the           
closeness... then he soundlessly heads out her door. A beat
-- Bella starts pulling on clothes.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Bella drives through the darkness.

                                                           65.



                          BELLA (V.O.)
              If I was going to lose someone else, I              
              needed to know why.

She pulls off the road, and drives into the forest.

EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

Bella parks. Climbs out of her truck. The moon eerily             
illuminates the clearing. Forest NOISES encroach.

She hears a RUSTLE amid the trees. Spooked, she freezes --        
then SEES JACOB emerge from the trees. A moment as their
eyes meet. Then --

Sam Uley, Paul, Embry and Jared step into the clearing, as        
well, half-clothed, movements almost synchronized. Their          
expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see
Bella. Paul spins on Jacob.

                          PAUL
              What the hell have you done?!

                          JACOB
              I didn't tell her.   You'd know if I                
              did.                                                

                          PAUL
              She's here, isn't she?

                          SAM
              Bella, there's nothing to see here.
              You should go home.

                          BELLA
              Not until I know what you did to Jacob.

                          PAUL
                   (advancing on Bella)
              What we did?!

Jacob moves in front of Bella protectively, facing Paul.

                          SAM
              Both of you, calm down --

                          JACOB
              Sam, she knows things about the                     
              bloodsuckers. She's been on the                     
              inside. She can help --                             

                          PAUL
              Like a leech lover's gonna help us.

                                                          66.



                          JACOB
              Watch what you call her.

                          EMBRY
              Get a grip, guys --

But Paul and Jacob are so angry, their bodies begin to
shake, nearly convulse. It unnerves Bella --

                          BELLA
              It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --                     

Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing.                                

                          PAUL
              All you care about is her --
                          SAM
                   (commanding)
              Paul, back off.

                          PAUL
               -- and she doesn't give a crap about
              you --

Jacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.   Paul FLIES backward.

                          SAM
              Jacob.

Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl,
vibrating violently --

                          JARED
              Too late.

                          SAM                                     
              Bella, get back!                                    
Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud
RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming
a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring!

Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him --               

                          BELLA                                   
              Run, Jacob! --                                      

But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf --     

                           BELLA                                  
              Jake, no!   Stop -- !                               

                                                              67.



Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp
TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur
BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic
russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf.                           

Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other,                 
snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING.
Their teeth flash at each other's throats.

Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves          
beyond the clearing and into the woods --

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into
the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS
of the fight still ECHO --
BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off           
his shoes.

                          SAM
              Take Bella to Emily's place.

Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.    A long silence...

                          EMBRY
              Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

Off Bella, stunned.

EXT. LA PUSH - EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny,                  
weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared,          
in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry             
head toward the house. She doesn't move.                             

                         EMBRY                                       
                   (to Jared)                                        
              Pay up. She didn't puke.                               

Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks.                              

                          EMBRY                                      
              Told you she was tough.     She does run               
              with bloodsuckers.                                     

                          BELLA                                      
              Wait. We should go back, make sure                     
              Jacob's okay.                                          

                          JARED                                      
              I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.                    
              Serve him right.                                       

                                                             68.



                          EMBRY                                     
              No way. Jake's a natural. You see                     
              him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver                   
              says Paul doesn't touch him.                          

                            JARED                                   
              Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer.              

Bella looks at them, appalled.      They realize she's not          
following them.                                                     

                            EMBRY                                   
              Come on in.    We won't bite.                         

                          JARED                                     
              Speak for yourself.                                   
Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry           
pauses at the door --

                          EMBRY
              Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance -                 
              just try not to stare. It bugs Sam.                   

                          BELLA
              Why would I stare? --

-- But the guys are already entering --

INT. EMILY'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees            
EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin.
SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long
black hair.

                          EMILY
              You guys hungry? Like I have to ask...
Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of
her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines
that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.

                            EMILY
              Who's this?                                           

As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins --

                            JARED
              Bella Swan.    Who else?

                          EMILY
              So you're the vampire girl.

                                                         69.



                          BELLA                                 
              And you're a... you're all...                     

                          EMILY                                 
              Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one.              
              But these animals --                              
                   (slaps Embry's hand)                         
              Save some for your brothers.                      

Bella cautiously approaches the counter, keeping an eye on      
the door for Jacob.                                             

                          EMILY                                 
              Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's
              gag order.
                          BELLA                                 
              He didn't say anything, or...                     
              couldn't.                                         

                          EMBRY                                 
              That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders               
              get obeyed whether we want to or not --           

                          JARED                                 
              How `bout you shut up now, Embry?                 

                          EMBRY                                 
              You know Jacob's gonna fill her in.               

                          JARED                                 
              Yeah, I know every stupid thought he              
              has.                                              
                   (to Bella)                                   
              Wanna know what he thinks of you?                 

                          EMILY                                 
              Like you need special powers to know              
              that.                                             

                          EMBRY                                 
                   (to Bella)                                   
              It's another wolf thing. We hear each             
              other's thoughts. Good for hunting.               
              Embarrassing for everything else.                 

Jared leans to Bella, challenging.                              

                          JARED                                 
              Freaking out yet?                                 

                                                         70.



                          BELLA                                 
                   (meets his look)                             
              You're not the first -- mind reader               
              I've met.                                         

                          EMBRY                                 
                   (grins)                                      
              Jake's right. You are good with the               
              weird.                                            

                          BELLA                                 
              But I don't get -- how?   Why? --                 

                          SAM (O.S.)                            
              -- Because there are bad things here.             
She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door      
open behind him.                                                

                          SAM                                   
              And they're getting worse.                        

Bella is chilled. Sam moves past her to Emily - the sight       
of her instantly warms his face.                                

                          SAM
              Hey, Em.

He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly. Bella has to look     
away. Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what
she has lost. Fortunately, she's distracted by --

Jacob and Paul's arrival. They laugh and jab one another.
Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed. Jared and Embry
crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm --

                           EMBRY
              Ha!   Pay up.
As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes       
find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.     

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAWN

The sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds         
overhead. Bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come       
to grips with this new reality. Jacob keeps his distance,       
trying to control his anger.                                    

                          BELLA                                 
              You just have to... stop.                         

                                                         71.



                          JACOB                                 
              It's not a life-style choice.   It's in           
              my DNA.                                           

                          BELLA                                 
              Killing is in your DNA?                           

                          JACOB                                 
              Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be              
              such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the             
              right kind of monster for you? Can't              
              measure up to your bloodsucking                   
              friends --                                        

                          BELLA                                 
                   (angry as well)                              
              Hey, they manage to survive without               
              hurting innocent people.                          

Jacob stops -- a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion.    

                          JACOB                                 
              Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't               
              care that I morph into a giant dog.               
              Just that I... kill people?                       

                          BELLA                                 
                   (appalled)                                   
              "Just?" Those hikers' lives mean that             
              little to you?                                    

He bursts out laughing.                                         

                         BELLA                                  
                   (repelled, turns to go)                      
              Oh my God.                                        

                          JACOB                                 
              Bella -- Bella wait...                            
                   (he stops her)                               
              We're not killing hikers.   We're                 
              trying to protect them.                           

                           BELLA                                
              From what?                                        

                          JACOB                                 
              The only thing we do kill: Vampires.

                         BELLA
                   (stunned, reels)
              Vampires? Jake, no --

                                                        72.



                          JACOB
                   (steps back, bitter)
              Don't worry, we can't touch your
              precious Cullens - unless they bite
              someone and violate the Treaty --

                          BELLA
              That's not what I -- you can't fight
              vampires. They're too dangerous.

                          JACOB
              Please. We took out that leech with
              the dreads easy enough.

                          BELLA                                
              You... killed Laurent?                           
                          JACOB                                
                   (worried)                                   
              ... He didn't seem like a friend.                

                            BELLA                              
              No, God no.    But... how?                       

                          JACOB
              It's what we do, why we exist. A few             
              "lucky guys" in the tribe have the               
              gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town,
              our DNA kicks in, we reach the right
              age and the fever hits --                        

                         BELLA
                   (realizing)
              "Mono."

                          JACOB
              I wish. Next thing I know, they're
              telling me, this is your life now. That
              future you saw for yourself? Gone.

Desolation fills him.   She sees this.

                          BELLA
              It's bad, huh?

                          JACOB
              I just hate feeling... out of control.
              Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't           
              be around me.

                          BELLA
              Like you could get rid of me.

                                                         73.



                          JACOB
              You've seen Emily.                                

That lands with her.   She nods.                                

                          JACOB                                 
              Sam lost it for a split second; Em was            
              standing too close -- he's still messed
              up about it.
                   (beat)                                       
              I don't want to be that kind of
              nightmare.

                          BELLA
              You're not like that. You save                    
              people, right? You saved me from                  
              Laurent.

                          JACOB
              Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His             
              red-headed girlfriend will be fun,
              too.

Bella stops, chilled to the bone.

                             BELLA
              Victoria.     She's here?

                          JACOB
              We chased her all the way to the
              border the other night. But she won't
              stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we
              knew what she was after...
                   (sees Bella's face)
              ... What?

                          BELLA
              I know what she wants.      Me.
                                                  SMASH TO:     

EXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY                                       

A MASERATI with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a    
blinding speed --

INT. MASERATI - SAME

CLOSE ON VICTORIA, easily controlling the steering wheel
with two fingers. She speaks to someone we don't see, her
words laced with longing and fury.

                                                            74.



                          VICTORIA
              James hated cars. He liked being
              close to the ground. But I'd steal                   
              one occasionally, to throw him off the
              scent... See, we played hide and seek
              sometimes. No one can hide like me --                
                   (grins to her passenger)
              -- but no one could seek like James.

INCLUDE her barely conscious passenger, DENISE, 30's, a
pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just
coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out.

                          DENISE
              What -- what are you -- ?
                            VICTORIA
              Some games   lasted months... but we
              always got   hungry for each other.
                   (sly,   to Denise)
              So I'd let   him find me...

Denise now lucid, looks around to SEE --                           

IN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed
in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted
forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him --

                            DENISE
              Michael?    Oh my God --

                          VICTORIA
              We never could get enough of each
              other...
                   (seething)
              We would have had forever to try.

Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm --
                           DENISE
              Michael?!

-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side,
revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead
eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins.

                          VICTORIA
              James always loved a screamer.

Victoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's
hair. She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we --

                                                     SMASH TO:

EXT. EMILY'S BACKYARD - DAY                                       

ON JARED --                                                       

                          JARED
              Excellent. If the redhead's after
              Bella, we've got bait.

With stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork
from some garden tools, and FLINGS it toward Jared's head -
Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it.

                          JACOB
              She is not bait.

INCLUDE - A picnic table in the middle of this small,             
quaintly landscaped garden. Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam,
Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast.

                          BELLA
              I should leave town.                                

                          SAM
              Victoria will follow you and make it                
              harder for us to catch her.

                          BELLA                                   
              No one can catch her.   She can escape              
              anything.                                           

                           PAUL                                   
              Ooh.   She has special powers.                      

                          BELLA                                   
              Some of them do.                                    

They all look at her.   She instantly regrets saying it.          
                          JACOB                                   
              Like... what? Bella?                                

                          JARED                                   
              The mind reader you said you knew. He               
              was a suckhead? Can they all do that?               

                          EMBRY                                   
              That would blow.                                    

                          BELLA                                   
              No, I -- shouldn't have - no.                       

                          PAUL                                    
              She's still protecting them.                        

                                                               76.



                           JARED                                      
               I don't know why. It's not like they                   
               stuck around to protect you --                         

                           JACOB                                      
               Guys, back off.                                        

Jacob looks apologetically at Bella.   She shrinks, stung.            

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                            

Jacob walks her to the door.                                          

                           JACOB                                      
               Don't worry, we've got this place                      
               covered. She won't get near you or                     
               Charlie.                                               

Bella nods.   He sees she's blue.                                     

                           JACOB                                      
               Hey, we should do something fun.                       
               Like... cliff diving, right?                           

                           BELLA                                      
               I could use the rush.                                  

                            JACOB                                     
               Soon.   After we catch her.                            

He offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods.            

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT                                             

Bella tentatively approaches the large, modern glass home.            
She climbs the porch steps, approaches the door...                    

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT
Bella enters to find it perfectly intact, lived-in, warm,             
candles glowing... and the Cullen family enjoying the
evening - Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett and Jasper.                 

Bella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them.                         

                           BELLA                                      
               You're here.                                           

But they ignore her. Won't even look at her.      She starts          
toward them but suddenly --                                           

Edward appears and YANKS Bella away, pulling her to the door          
and pushing her out, slamming it on her --                            

                                                           77.



EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT                          

-- Bella runs to the window, peers in at the family who           
continue to ignore her as they gather around Edward --            

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING                                       

Bella awakens, tears on her face. She can't take it. Gets         
the hell out of bed, anxious to leave the dream behind. But       
it stays with her...                                              

EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          

Bella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind           
blowing strong. Emily opens the door. Sees her.                   
                           EMILY                                  
              Bella.   Are you okay?                              

                          BELLA                                   
              Yeah, I just... is Jacob here?   He                 
              wasn't at home...                                   

Sam appears behind Emily.                                         

                          SAM                                     
              He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an               
              eye on things. I'm heading out soon.                
              Should I tell him something?                        

-- as Sam wraps an arm around Emily. Their deep love is           
achingly obvious. Off Bella's face --                             

FLASHPOP to Bella and Edward at her birthday party, in a          
similar embrace, as Alice SNAPS their picture --                  

BACK ON BELLA - pained.                                           
                          EMILY                                   
              You want to come in?                                

-- But Bella's already hurrying to her truck, determination       
on her face.                                                      

EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                  

CLOSE ON A RIFLE as it locks and loads. INCLUDE CHARLIE,
who checks it, then notes the position of the SIX MEN in his
hunting party, all wearing rain gear. He SEES Harry at the
end of the line, pausing, looking down.

                          CHARLIE
              You got something, Harry?

                                                           78.



ON HARRY - he looks down at a large WOLF PAW PRINT.

                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              Nope, nothin'.

The hunting party moves forward.   Harry lets them get ahead,
stomps out the paw print.

ON CHARLIE as he passes under a huge tree --

WHIP PAN UP THE TREE to find that HIGH ABOVE, crouching on a
limb, is VICTORIA. She watches Charlie with a vengeful glare.

She noiselessly SWINGS down to a lower branch, getting ready
to pounce on Charlie --
ON HARRY - his eye catches her movement; he looks up, SEES
the back of her red head -- his breath CATCHES --

She HEARS the sound, even through the rain and wind.    Before    
Harry can raise his shotgun --

Victoria's standing next to him, WHIPPING the gun out of his      
hands with superhuman speed. He GASPS, breath stuck in his        
chest. She grins, about to bite -- but suddenly --                

THE RUSSET-BROWN JACOB-WOLF smashes into her, knocking her        
away. She rights herself immediately and takes off --             

THE THREE WOLVES give chase, disappearing. It all happened        
soundlessly, in seconds, unbeknownst to the others...

STAY ON HARRY - he still can't catch his breath, IN SLOW
MOTION he clasps his left arm -- INTERCUT WITH --

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - SAME

LIGHTNING FAST CUTS of THE CHASE - the wolves are right on
Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest --

BACK ON CHARLIE - SLOW MOTION - He turns to SEE Harry
clutching his chest. Charlie runs to Harry's side --

SMASH BACK TO VICTORIA escaping at breakneck speed she
bursts out of the trees to --                                     

EXT. THE OCEAN (CONTINUOUS) - SAME

-- Victoria beelines for the choppy water, dives in -- when
she reappears, she's hundreds of yards offshore --

THE WOLVES prowl the beach in frustration as we go --

                                                              79.



BACK ON HARRY - SLOW MOTION - he falls to his knees just as
Charlie reaches him. Off Charlie beginning CPR...

                                                     SMASH TO:

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAY

Bella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out. Ignoring the
wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down --

BELLA'S POV - THE WATER - steely gray.     Rough whitecaps.

                           EDWARD (O.S.)                             
              Step back.                                             

Bella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes.    She          
turns to find Edward's apparition at her side.                       

She steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to           
disappear.                                                           

That's it. She starts pulling off her shoes and coat,                
adrenaline pumping --                                                

Edward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going --                

                          EDWARD                                     
              Stop this now, Bella.                                  

                          BELLA                                      
              You won't stay with me any other way.                  

She takes a last look at him... then with a running leap --          
FLINGS herself over the edge --                                      

ON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down,           
down... then SPLASHES into the water.                                
EXT. ON THE WATER'S SURFACE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                       

No sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up.
Inhales deeply -- and laughs!

                           BELLA
              Yes!

She enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns
to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes
how strong the current is...

A WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.     Then         
ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under...

                                                           80.



UNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles --

ABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES --

BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish,
bobbing on the surface of the water --

Bella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing
is suddenly thirty yards closer.

Bella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her
into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks.

ANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating
effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips
below the surface, vanishing...
UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward      
appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love.
He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things
going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR --

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious.

                          JACOB
              Breathe, Bella! C'mon!

Jacob hits her on the back.   She spits up water, coming to.

                           JACOB
              Bella?   Can you hear me?

                          BELLA
              ... Jake?
She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved.
Behind him stands Sam.

                          SAM
              She'll be alright.

Sam looks out at the water, scanning it.   Sensing something.

                          JACOB
              What the hell were you thinking?

                          BELLA
              I needed... to see... something.

                                                         81.



                           JACOB
               What? The pearly gates?   If we hadn't
               heard you scream --

                           SAM
               Get her home. I'm heading to the                 
               hospital. I'll meet you there.                   

Jacob nods.   Sam jogs off.

                           JACOB
               Why would you jump? Didn't you notice
               it's like a hurricane out here?

                           BELLA
               I know. It was stupid --                         
                    (realizing)
               -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?

                           JACOB
               Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

                           BELLA
               Oh my God - does my Dad know?

                           JACOB
               He and my dad are both over there.

                           BELLA
               Will Harry be okay?

                           JACOB
               I don't know. Come on. I'll find you
               something dry and drive you home.

As Jacob helps Bella up, we RACK FOCUS out to --

ANGLE ON THE WATER - where Victoria bobs, watching Jacob
guide Bella away... then she disappears below the surface.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Jacob drives. Bella wears a fleece jacket but still
shivers. He pulls her close, wrapping an arm around her --

                           JACOB
               Hundred and eight degrees over here.

She tucks herself into him.

                           BELLA
               Must be nice, never getting cold.

                                                         82.



                           JACOB
               It's a wolf thing.

                           BELLA                                
               It's a Jacob thing.   You're just...             
               warm.                                            

                           JACOB                                
                    (grins)                                     
               Like the sun.                                    

                           BELLA                                
                    (meaning it)                                
               Like the sun.                                    

                           JACOB                                
               Which always comes back.   You can               
               count on me.                                     

She nods.   Awkward silence.   He fills it.                     

                           JACOB                                
               There are other cool things about all            
               this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see             
               me stab my hand?

                           BELLA
                    (no!)
               Yeah, `cause that would be fun.                  

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

The truck pulls up to the curb. It's pitch black outside.
Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off.

                           BELLA                                
               So... this wolf thing's not all bad?             
                           JACOB                                
               It's better. Now that you know.                  
               But...                                           

                            BELLA                               
               ... but...                                       

                           JACOB                                
               It just... comes so easily to me.                
               More than the other guys.                        

                           BELLA                                
               That's a good thing, isn't it?                   

                                                         83.



                          JACOB                                  
              Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less...                
              human than the others.
                   (beat, quieter)
              Sometimes I'm scared I might...                    
              disappear, you know? Who I really am.              

Bella faces him, looks directly in his eyes.

                          BELLA
              I won't let that happen.

Their faces are close... and stay close for an intimate
beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks
herself back to reality and pulls away.
                          BELLA
              Thanks for driving - for everything.

-- as she pushes open her door. WIND wafts in -- Jacob
reacts to a repugnant smell outside --

                          JACOB
              Holy crap -- !

He abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck, SLAMS her door
shut and starts the truck.

                          JACOB
              There's a bloodsucker out there.

                          BELLA
              How do you know?

                          JACOB
              I can smell the stink.   I'm getting               
              you out of here.
As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --

BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY -- a black Mercedes is parked in
front. Bella spins to the rear window as Jacob floors it --

                           BELLA
              Stop!   It's not Victoria --

                          JACOB
              Forget it --

                          BELLA
              It's Carlisle's car!   They're here.               
              Go back! --

                                                          84.



                          JACOB
              It's a trick --

He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while
they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out --

                          JACOB
              Damn it, Bella --

EXT. ROAD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hurries up the road toward her house. Jacob's
suddenly standing in front of her, furious --

                           JACOB
              Stop.   You gotta come with me.                    
                           BELLA
              It's okay.   They're my friends --

                          JACOB
              Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back
              here, this is their territory. The Treaty
              says we can only defend our own lands.             

                          BELLA
              -- It's not a war --

                         JACOB
              It is. And you'll only be safe in La
              Push. I can't protect you here anymore.            

                          BELLA
              I don't need you to --

                          JACOB
              -- You're about to cross a line --
                          BELLA
              Only if you draw one.                              

She starts to move past him, but he stops her --                 

                          JACOB                                  
              I'm not letting you do this.                       

                          BELLA                                  
              You don't have a choice.   I don't                 
              belong to you.                                     

Her words are a knife to the heart. She sees that, but           
can't take them back. He hands her the keys.                     

                                                          85.



                          JACOB
              Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die.

She flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the
darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road.

She's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries
forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches
crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her...
nothing but darkness... she faces forward again ---

And runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then
realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice.

                           BELLA
              Alice!
                          ALICE
              You're... alive.

She's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy.

                          BELLA
              Oh my God, Alice.    You're here.

                          ALICE
              I heard voices - I didn't think it was
              you but - you're alive.

                          BELLA
              You keep saying that.

                          ALICE
              I saw you - a vision of you - you
              jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too
              late but --                                        
                   (becoming angry)
              Why the hell would you try to kill
              yourself?!

                            BELLA
              I didn't.    I was cliff diving.

                           ALICE
              Why?!

                           BELLA
              Um... fun?

                          ALICE
              That was fun for you.

                                                        86.



                          BELLA
              Until I hit the water.

                          ALICE
              I have never met anyone more prone to
              life-threatening idiocy... and what is
              that hideous wet dog smell?                      

                         BELLA
              Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a          
              werewolf.

Off Alice's horrified expression.

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces.

                          BELLA
              Werewolves are not vicious.

                          ALICE
              Until they lose their tempers.

                          BELLA
              They saved me from Laurent, they're
              protecting me from Victoria --

                          ALICE
                   (shocked)
              Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't             
              see you get pulled from the water                
              either.                                          

                          BELLA
              It was Jacob who saved me. More than             
              once. I couldn't have made it without            
              him. You have no idea what it was                
              like.

                          ALICE
                   (softening)
              Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't               
              be good for you. I tried to tell
              Edward, but he wouldn't listen.

                          BELLA
                   (hesitantly)
              ... Does he know you're here?

                           ALICE
              No.   He's been... away...

                                                          87.



INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY                   

A dump, empty but for a table and chair. On the table lie        
THE PHOTOS that once lined Bella's walls. Edward stands in       
the center of the room, stock still, staring out at the          
rising sun. His face is as empty and desolate as Bella's         
was after he left.

A CELL PHONE on the table RINGS jarringly. He doesn't move.      
It continues. Finally, he whips the receiver to his ear,
exasperated.

                            EDWARD
                 What?

                             ROSALIE (O.S.)
                 Wow, Edward finally answered the
                 phone. I feel so honored...                     

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

Rosalie, on the phone, stands at the picture window --

ROSALIE'S POV - EXT. ALASKAN HOUSE - Emmett, Jasper,
Carlisle and Esme walk away from the house, over the snow to     
the treeline, on their way to hunt. None wear coats.             

                             EDWARD
                 I'm hanging up now...

Rosalie turns away from the window.

                             ROSALIE
                 Wait!... You should come home.                  
                      (no response)
                 Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles.          
                 Even Emmett's depressed. You've
                 really done a number on them.

                             EDWARD                              
                      (pained)                                   
                 I'm sorry. I am. But they wouldn't              
                 be happier with me around. Trust me.            

                             ROSALIE
                 I... I just miss... us.   The family.           

                             EDWARD                              
                 I know. But the further away I am,              
                 the safer Bella will be. She deserves           
                 a shot at a normal life --                      

                                                            88.



                          ROSALIE
              But see, you don't have to worry about               
              that, not anymore --

She stops realizing she may be making a mistake.     But Edward    
caught it, sits up.

                           EDWARD
              Why, Rose?   Did something happen?

                           ROSALIE
              I - uh --

                          EDWARD
              Tell me, Rosalie.
                   (rises, fierce)
              Tell me! --

                          ROSALIE
                   (blurts)
              -- Alice had a vision. She saw Bella -               
              - throw herself off a cliff... She's
              dead, Edward.

Edward reels, uncomprehending.                                     

                          EDWARD                                   
              I... don't believe it.                               

                          ROSALIE                                  
              Alice is there now. Thought she could                
              help with the funeral or something.                  

STAY ON ROSALIE as --                                              

                          ROSALIE                                  
              Come home, Edward. It's time...                      
              Edward...?                                           
She's been disconnected.   Off Rosalie, worried...                 

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                           

Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser. He wears a dark, ill-
fitting funeral suit. At the car, Bella adjusts his tie --

                          CHARLIE
              Thanks for understanding, Bells. They                
              wanted to keep the service small.

                          BELLA
              Don't worry about me.    Are you gonna               
              be okay?

                                                           89.



                          CHARLIE
              Yeah... but Sue, and those kids --
              Leah's only a year older than you.
              And Seth's, what, fourteen...

Emotion threatens. She hugs him. He holds on a little too
tightly for a beat. Then he bucks up, climbs into his car.

                          CHARLIE
              There'll be a reception after. I
              might stay late, see if I can help.

Bella nods, then waves as he drives away. She turns to head
back inside but finds Alice suddenly at her side. She jumps.

                          ALICE
              You're not going?

                          BELLA
              I'm not the most popular person on the
              werewolf rez right now.

                          ALICE
                   (saddened)                                     
              Because you're friends with me.                     

Bella shrugs. Alice hears something, then looks down the          
road -- JACOB'S RABBIT appears in the distance....

                          ALICE
              Huh. Didn't see them coming. Didn't                 
              see him pull you out of the water -                 
              maybe my visions are allergic to dogs.              

                           BELLA
               -- Alice.

                          ALICE
                   (jogging off)
              I'll go do some hunting.

ANGLE ON THE RABBIT -- as it pulls up. Jacob drives, Embry in
the passenger seat. Bella approaches, surprised to find QUIL
in the back; same short hair and hard look as the others.

                          BELLA
              Quil... you, too?                                   

                         QUIL
                   (aggressive)                                   
              Yeah. Me, too.                                      

Jacob climbs out.   Embry takes the driver's seat.

                                                               90.



                           JACOB
              You alone?

                           BELLA
              Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral?

                          JACOB
              Had to talk to you first.
                   (to the guys)
              I'll meet you there. Go on.

They're wary... but pull out.      Jacob follows Bella into --

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jacob enters behind Bella.   She turns to him...
                          BELLA
              Look, Jake, I'm sorry I --

                          JACOB
              This place stinks to hell.

She sees he's shut down, cold.      She shuts down, as well.

                          BELLA
              You're welcome to leave.      In fact --

                          JACOB
              -- How many Cullens are here and how
              long are they staying?

                          BELLA
                   (snapping back)                                    
              Just Alice. And she'll stay as long
              as she wants.

                          JACOB
              Are the rest coming back?

                          BELLA
              Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else?

                           JACOB
              That's it.

                          BELLA
              Better go report to Sam.

Jacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger
turn to hurt. He stops. Beat.

                                                             91.



                           JACOB
               I've done it again. I keep breaking                  
               my promise not to hurt you.                          

                           BELLA
               It doesn't have to be this way.

He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness.

                           JACOB
               Yeah, it does.

                           BELLA
               Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?

He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek.
                           JACOB
               It was easier when we were both human,
               wasn't it?

They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face,           
his eyes searching hers.

Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull         
away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This            
time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away...          

Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump.        
Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps         
looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers --       

                           JACOB                                    
               Swan residence.                                      

She smiles.   But he instantly bristles, voice going cold.          

                           JACOB                                    
               He's not here. He's at a funeral...                  

Then the phone goes dead --                                         

INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - SAME                     

-- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief-               
stricken -- he HURLS it against the wall, shattering it.            

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME                             

-- Jacob hangs up the phone.                                        

                           JACOB                                    
               Filthy bloodsucker.                                  

                                                            92.



                          BELLA                                    
              Wait, who was it?                                    

                          JACOB                                    
                   (spitting it out)                               
              Dr. Carlisle Cullen.                                 

                          BELLA                                    
              You should have let me talk to him.                  

                          JACOB                                    
              He didn't ask for you --                             

Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts          
trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph.
                          JACOB
              Step away from me, Bella.

Bella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice. She
stands in doorway looking empty, despairing. Bella                 
immediately hurries to her side.                                   

                          BELLA
              Alice, what's wrong?

                            ALICE
              ... Edward.

                          BELLA
              What about him? What happened?

                          ALICE
              I just saw him in a vision.   He...                  
              thinks you're dead.

                          BELLA                                    
                   (realizing)                                     
              That was him calling, not Carlisle.                  

                          ALICE                                    
              Bella, he's going to Italy... to the                 
              Volturi...

OFF BELLA'S FACE -- FLASHPOPS of the CIRCULAR HALL, the            
THREE VOLTURI - the DISMEMBERING of the rogue vampire --           

                                                    SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY

The door SLAMS open and Bella races in, shoving clothes into
a bag. Jacob dogs her, protesting.

                                                                 93.



                            JACOB
                Why do you have to go?

                            BELLA
                He won't believe Alice.    He has to see                
                that I'm alive.                                         

                            JACOB
                     (stops her)
                He left you, Bella. He didn't want
                you anymore, remember?

                            BELLA
                But I still love him, and I'm not gonna
                let him kill himself out of guilt.
This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.         She
pulls away and continues packing.

                            JACOB
                What about your dad?

                            BELLA
                I'm eighteen, legally free to go.
                I'll leave a note.                                      

Alice enters.

                            ALICE
                Got the airline tickets.

                            JACOB
                     (squaring off with Alice)
                You Cullens might hunt animals but
                those monsters in Italy don't.                          

                            ALICE
                I'm well aware what the Volturi are.
                            JACOB
                Then why are you taking Bella to them
                like a bottle of wine to a party?

                            ALICE
                Right, she's better off here with
                Victoria stalking her. The one you
                dogs can't seem to catch?

Jacob growls, a shudder ripping through him. Bella
intercedes, stopping him from morphing by grabbing Alice.

                            BELLA
                Let's go.

                                                            94.



EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice flies to her car. But Jacob catches Bella's arm, not
hostile. Just pleading.

                          JACOB
              Please, Bella. Stay here.   For                      
              Charlie... for me.

Bella sees the love in his eyes; this could be last time she
ever sees him. She hugs him, then pulls away.

                            BELLA
              Bye, Jacob.

He watches, agonized as she races to the car, climbs in...
INT. THE MERCEDES (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella tries to pull on her seat belt but Alice stops her --

                          ALICE
              Maybe Jacob's right.                                 
                   (Bella tries to                                 
                    interrupt)                                     
              No. You need to realize - the Volturi                
              could easily see me as Edward's
              accomplice. And you're a human who
              knows too much and tastes too good.
              They could kill us all.

Bella's response is to yank her seat belt into its clip.           
Alice sees she won't change her mind. She shifts into gear         
and PEELS OUT. Bella looks out the window for Jacob; he's          
not there... she turns toward the woods --                         

BELLA'S POV -- THE TREELINE -- SHREDDED CLOTHING FLIES in the
air as we SEE the HIND LEGS OF A WOLF disappear into the
forest. Off Bella, fighting tears but determined as hell...        

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT                                  

ON EDWARD walking down a seemingly endless corridor.
Finally, he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors
which open for him. He enters --

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones, on
which sit the ancient Volturi: Aro, Marcus, Caius.                 

Aro wears an expensive, contemporary, black Italian suit,          
long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist.

                                                          95.


Marcus and Caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes,
their long hair loose around them. All three have
translucent, onion-like, white skin.

                          EDWARD
              Have you decided?

                          ARO
              It was an intriguing debate.     We don't
              get many suicidal vampires.

                           CAIUS
              Pathetic.

                          ARO
              I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable
              to destroy. But if you're unhappy
              with your lot, join us. We'd be
              delighted to utilize your skills.

                          EDWARD
              So you won't end this.

                          MARCUS
              Not without cause.

Edward registers this, his face setting. Clearly, he's           
going to give them cause. He strides out. Off Aro...             

                          ARO
              Such a waste.

EXT. FLORENCE AIRPORT, ITALY - MORNING

Bella waits impatiently at the curb as --                        

A YELLOW HARD-TOP PORSCHE with darkly tinted windows
SCREECHES to a halt in front of her. The passenger door          
opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic,         
white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun.      
As Bella climbs in, buckles up --                                

                          BELLA
              Where'd you get the car?

                          ALICE
              Hope you're not opposed to grand theft
              auto.

                           BELLA
              Not today.

Alice FLOORS it and the Porsche PEELS OUT --

                                                            96.



EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

AERIAL VIEW - THE YELLOW PORSCHE screams down a highway,
cutting lanes, weaving through Peugots and Fiats --

INT. PORSCHE - DAY

Bella grips the dashboard as Alice narrowly misses a car.

                          BELLA
              How much time do we have.                            

                          ALICE (O.S.)                             
              He's waiting till noon, when the sun's               
              at its highest...                                    
                                                   SMASH TO:       

EXT. VOLTERRA - PALAZZO DEI PRIORI - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

It's jumpy, uneven -- EDWARD stands in shadow, his shirt
open, eyes shut. A clock GONGS as he steps into SUNLIGHT --

                          ALICE                                    
              ... He's going to make the Volturi                   
              change their minds.                                  

INT. PORSCHE - SAME                                                

                          BELLA
                   (checking her watch)
              It's almost noon now.

                          ALICE
              There's Volterra.

Alice punches it as Bella SEES --
BELLA'S POV - A MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED VILLAGE atop a distant
hill. Volterra.

EXT. VOLTERRA - DAY

The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival
revellers who all wear RED. They gaily head toward the town
square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The
PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward.

INTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE --

                          BELLA
              Why are they all wearing red?

                                                          97.



                          ALICE
              San Marcos Day festival. The perfect               
              setting. Large crowds. The Volturi                 
              won't let him get far enough to reveal             
              himself - he's counting on that.                   

                          BELLA
              We only have five minutes --

Alice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.   Italian POLICE      
wave her back. Bella jumps out --

                          BELLA
              Where's the square?

                          ALICE
              Follow that lane --

-- Bella's already running --

                          ALICE
              He'll be under the clock tower!

Alice watches her go... then senses something, looks up --

ALICE'S POV - ON THE ROOFTOPS - A FIGURE IN A BLACK HOODED
OVERCOAT leaps from building to building, tracking Bella.
As he disappears, off Alice --

EXT. VOLTERRA ALLEYS - SERIES OF FAST CUTS - DAY

Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the
uneven stones. Festival revellers head in the same
direction, she maneuvers around them.

ABOVE BELLA - SEE flashes of the FIGURE IN THE OVERCOAT --

As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated.
She pushes past people AD LIBBING "excuse me," "sorry."
Finally, she emerges into --

EXT. PALAZZO DEI PRIORI (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets.
On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER;
it reads one minute before noon.

Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves
back, shouting at her in Italian --

                          ITALIAN MAN
              Fare attenzione!

                                                            98.



Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by --

A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!    The clock tower bells chime.
It's noon!

Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow
water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through
the crowd. Finally, she SEES --

BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER

Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight.

                            BELLA
              Edward! --
-- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME.
She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --

CLOSE ON EDWARD (IN SLOW MOTION) - as he unbuttons his
shirt, exposing his bare chest --

ON BELLA (IN SLOW MOTION) - calling his name --

ON EDWARD'S FACE - he closes his eyes, welcoming death --
then slowly --

Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his        
shoe, but before the sun touches his skin --                       

BELLA SLAMS into him - it's like running into a brick wall --      

                            BELLA
              No, Edward!    Don't!

Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms
its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind.            
                          EDWARD                                   
              Carlisle was right... heaven...                      

                          BELLA                                    
              No, I'm here. I'm alive.                             

                          EDWARD
                   (confused)                                      
              You're... not real.

                            BELLA
              Look at me!    Alice was wrong.                      

He begins to realize... she is real.

                                                            99.



                          EDWARD
              Bella?

                          BELLA
              Please, step back.   I'm alive, I'm --

He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with
her. They soak each other in like starved people suddenly
nourished. He pulls away to look at her...

                          EDWARD
              You're here.

                          BELLA
              I'm here.
They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when
suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind
him, taking a protective stance in front of her --

They face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower.
Out of the alley's shadows emerge --

TWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome
males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI,             
slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES.

                          EDWARD
              I won't be needing your services after
              all, gentlemen.

                          FELIX
              Aro wants to speak with you again.

                          EDWARD
              No rules were broken.                                

Demetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree. He's the more
gracious of the two. But no less dangerous.

                          DEMETRI
              We should take this conversation to a
              more appropriate venue.

                          EDWARD
              Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and                  
              enjoy the festival?                                  

                          FELIX
              The girl comes with us.

                          EDWARD
              That's not going to happen --                        

                                                         100.



ALICE suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley       
toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat.

                          ALICE
              Come on, guys, it's a festival.                    

She reaches Edward and Bella, positioning herself in a
protective stance, as well.                                      

                          ALICE                                  
              We wouldn't want to make a scene.                  

                          FELIX                                  
              There won't be any scene.    And we'll             
              still win.                                         
                          EDWARD
              But not easily --

                            JANE (O.S.)
              Enough.

A very tiny, young woman appears, JANE. She also wears a
dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out
from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES.

Felix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and           
Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of        
this small girl.

                            EDWARD
                      (nodding to her)
              Jane.

                          BELLA
                   (sotto to Alice)
              Who is she?
                          ALICE
                   (sotto to Bella)
              Just do as she says.

Jane tosses Edward an overcoat.    He dons it.

                            JANE
              Follow me.

Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll
follow. Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of
him. Edward takes Bella's hand...

                                                           101.



EXT. VOLTERRA STREETS - DAY

Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow,
dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward
never loosens his grip on Bella's hand.

Their path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides
forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN
HOLE in the street; it's a drain. Alice follows Jane.
Bella looks down, sees nothing but BLACKNESS.

                          EDWARD
              It's alright. Alice will catch you.

Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole --
INT. SEWERS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught
by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri.

Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the
sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring,
but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach --

A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.
They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them --

                                                     SMASH TO:

CLOSE ON MODERN ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. They all exit into --      

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

An elegantly decorated space with old world charm. They're         
greeted politely by GIANNA an attractive (human) receptionist.     

                          GIANNA
              Buon pomeriggio.

They head through the lobby to --

THE LONG CORRIDOR that Edward traversed earlier.   Finally,
they reach the carved double doors which open --                   

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients:
Aro, Marcus, Caius.

Eight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the
walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats.

                                                           102.



BELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center
that leads to a drain. Bella shivers.

Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's
hand and shaking it --

                          ARO
              What a happy surprise! Bella is alive
              after all. Isn't that wonderful?

Caius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care           
less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as --        

                          ARO
              Her blood appeals to you so much it
              makes me thirsty. How can you stand
              to be so close to her?

                          EDWARD
              It's not without effort.

                          ARO
                   (laughing)
              I can see that.

Off Bella's look, Edward explains --                               

                          EDWARD
              One touch and Aro can see every                      
              thought I've ever had in my life.

                          ARO
              You're quite the telepath yourself,
              Edward. Though... you can't read
              Bella's thoughts. Fascinating.

He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella.
                          ARO
              I would love to see if you are an                    
              exception to my gifts, as well.                      

He reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a        
choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his          
hand. Bella finally takes it.                                      

A beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him.        

                          ARO
              Interesting.

He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought.

                                                             103.



                          ARO
              I wonder if --                                         

                            EDWARD                                   
                      (reading Aro's thoughts)                       
              No!                                                    

                          ARO                                        
              Let's see if she's immune to all our                   
              powers, shall we Jane?                                 

Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her --        

Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him             
across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane          
concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain.           
                            BELLA
              Stop!

Bella and Alice rush to his side.    As soon as Jane looks
away, Edward's pain ceases.

                            ARO
              Jane, dear.    The girl?                               

Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the         
pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by              
anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy.                       

Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with         
a tiny gesture.                                                      

                          ARO
              Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So
              what do we do with you now?

                          MARCUS                                     
                   (seemingly bored)                                 
              You already know what you'll do, Aro.                  

                          CAIUS                                      
              She knows too much; she's a liability.                 

                          ARO
              That's true. Unless Edward intends to
              give her immortality...
                   (looks at Edward)
              But that's not your intention, is it.
              Shame.

He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a         
step before Edward tackles him.                                      

                                                          104.



                          BELLA                                   
              Edward, don't!                                      

Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back,      
which is no easy job. As she struggles mightily --                

Edward is David to Felix's Goliath.    Edward will lose, but      
he'll go down fighting.                                           

-- Edward is fast, anticipating Felix's moves before he           
makes them, but Felix is stronger --                              

-- Felix grabs Edward, throws him into the ceiling, SMASHING      
against the marble; he drops like a stone. Is then                
immediately KICKED across the room.                               
                         BELLA                                    
                   (to Aro)                                       
              Stop this! Please!                                  

But Aro ignores her, leans forward to study Edward.    Jane is    
itching to step in. Aro gestures her back.                        

-- Felix takes some hits, but then lifts Edward overhead,         
CRACKING him like a nut, then flinging him against a wall --      

Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away;        
she flies HARD against the wall.                                  

The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice --              

Bella, bruised, but not broken, makes another attempt to get      
to Aro -- finally reaches him, kneels in front of him --          

                            BELLA
              Do it!    Kill me! Just leave them
              alone!
-- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him.
Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat.

                           ARO
              Enough.                                             

Felix immediately releases Edward who manages to look up.         
He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro.                           

                          EDWARD
              Get away from her -- !

Edward moves toward Aro but is quickly immediately pinned by      
Jane's invisible powers; he writhes in agony. Alice can no        
longer bear Edward's suffering --                                 

                                                          105.



                          ALICE                                   
              Edward, stop. I've already seen it.                 

                          EDWARD                                  
                   (through gritted teeth)                        
              Alice, stay out of it.                              

                          ALICE                                   
              I know what to do.                                  

Aro, intrigued, gestures for Jane to stop; Edward goes limp.      

                          ARO
              Ah yes, the clairvoyant. I saw your
              gift in Edward's thoughts. What is it               
              you've seen?                                        
                          EDWARD                                  
              ... don't...                                        

                          ALICE                                   
              I'm the one who will change Bella.                  

Bella is taken aback by this.   Aro is surprised, as well.        

                         ARO                                      
                   (beat, then gestures)                          
              Please. Be my guest.                                

                          ALICE                                   
              Not here. Her father is in law                      
              enforcement. If she goes missing,                   
              there will be questions.                            

                          CAIUS                                   
              He is easily dealt with.                            

                          ALICE
              It will happen, Aro.   See for                      
              yourself.

She thrusts out her hand. Aro nods to the Guards who              
release her. She gives him her hand. He closes his eyes --        

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

Edward hunts a deer. Matching his pace is another vampire -
Bella! She's pale and beautiful - she and Edward smile at
each other as they take a last grand leap for the kill --

                                               SMASH BACK TO:

                                                            106.



INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

BACK ON ARO, utterly delighted.   He releases Alice's hand.

                          ARO
              Mesmerizing! To see the things you've
              seen, that haven't happened yet!                      

Alice moves to Edward's side, helps him up.                         

                          ALICE
              I'm so sorry.                                         

                          ARO
                   (to Bella)
              Your gifts will make for an intriguing
              immortal. Go make your preparations.                  

Bella hurries to Edward's side, too.    Caius is put out.           

                          CAIUS                                     
              You're letting them leave?                            

                          ARO                                       
              Dear Caius, the girl's disappearance                  
              will be conspicuous at best. And                      
              surely you see her potential.                         

                          MARCUS                                    
                   (dispassionately)                                
              Let us be done with this.    Heidi will               
              arrive any moment.                                    

Aro gestures - Demetri throws open the carved double doors.         
Caius glares at them threateningly.                                 

                          CAIUS                                     
              We will make sure she follows through.                
              I would not delay. We do not offer                    
              second chances.                                       

Edward, recovered now, takes Bella by the arm and, with             
Alice, they cautiously back toward the door --

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LONG CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall.
As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming
toward them --

A GROUP OF TWO DOZEN TOURISTS, led by a beautiful vampire,
HEIDI. Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass.
As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile --

                                                            107.



                            DEMETRI
                     (sotto)                                        
                Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me.              

Heidi smiles.   She gives Bella a curious once-over, then
continues on.

                            HEIDI
                     (to the group)
                This way, please. Stay together...

A HUSBAND and WIFE, 60's, cameras around their necks, pass
Bella. The Husband winks at Bella --

                            TOURIST HUSBAND
                Unusual tour, isn't it?
                            TOURIST WIFE
                Bill, get a picture of that bust there.

As the Tourists file past, we HEAR a variety of languages,
German, Japanese, English.

The group is moved toward the carved double doors which
swing open for them. They file into the marble hall --

Edward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as
the last of the tourists disappear inside.

As the large doors close... we begin to HEAR SCREAMING --

Edward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S                
TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder --

                                                     SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT
ON BELLA'S SLEEPING FACE as the SCREAMING CRESCENDOS --
Bella sits bolt upright, yelling --

                            BELLA
                -- Stop!                                            

She catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she             
turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her.              

                            BELLA
                It... wasn't a dream.                               

                            EDWARD
                Go back to sleep. You've been through               
                a lot.

                                                         108.



                          BELLA                                  
              No, you might --                                   

                          EDWARD                                 
              I'll be here when you wake up.                     

Beat, she looks at him, wary.                                    

                           BELLA                                 
              Why?   Out of guilt?                               

                          EDWARD                                 
                   (realizing)                                   
              You... think I asked the Volturi to                
              kill me because I felt guilty?                     
                            BELLA                                
              Didn't you?                                        

                          EDWARD                                 
              I went to them because I thought I'd               
              lost you.                                          

                          BELLA                                  
              You didn't even want me.                           

Now Edward takes her by the shoulders.                           

                          EDWARD                                 
              Bella. The only reason I left was to               
              protect you. I wanted you to have a                
              chance at a normal, happy life.                    

                          BELLA                                  
              But it was so easy for you to leave.               

                          EDWARD                                 
              I had to be convincing. But easy?     In           
              my hundred years, I've never had a                 
              harder time than what I just went                  
              through.                                           

She's beginning to believe him.                                  

                          BELLA                                  
              I kept seeing you. Visions of you.                 
              Always protecting me. I thought I was              
              going crazy.                                       

                          EDWARD                                 
              Your own instincts were speaking to                
              you. I wish it had been me. But                    
              you're the heroic one. You saved me.               

                                                            109.



He moves to kiss her... but abruptly stops.   Suddenly --           

HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS            
flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone.                         

                          CHARLIE                                   
              You alright? Another nightmare?                       

                            BELLA                                   
              I'm okay.    You don't have to worry.                 

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Last time you said that, you                          
              disappeared. You want to talk                         
              nightmares?                                           
                          BELLA                                     
                   (sincere)                                        
              I'm really sorry, Dad.                                

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Just... don't ever do that to me                      
              again. Okay?                                          
                   (off her nod)                                    
              And you're grounded for the rest of                   
              your life.                                            

                           BELLA                                    
              I know.                                               

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Get some rest so I can keep lecturing                 
              you in the morning.                                   

He kisses her forehead. Exits.     A beat... she turns to find      
Edward sitting on the bed.                                          

                          EDWARD                                    
              He won't forgive me easily.                           

                           BELLA                                    
              Nope.                                                 

                          EDWARD
              Will you? I don't deserve it but... I                 
              hope you will. Because I honestly                     
              have no idea how to live without you.                 

Bella melts in his eyes.   He kisses her.

                          BELLA
              You won't be able to get rid of me                    
              once Alice changes me.                                

                                                          110.



                          EDWARD
              She won't have to. There are ways to                
              keep the Volturi in the dark.                       

                          BELLA
                   (pulling away)
              They'll come after your whole family.
              You'd risk that just to keep me human?

                          EDWARD
              Just? You really don't understand
              what you'd be giving up.

                          BELLA
              I really do.
They look at each other; an impasse.    She decides something,    
grabs her jeans, pulls them on--

                          BELLA
              You're not the only one with a say in it.           

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN                            

CLOSE ON BELLA --

                          BELLA
              You all know what Edward wants. And
              you know what I want. But I won't
              force myself on you...

INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CULLEN FAMILY who surround Bella. The          
house has been restored to it's original warmth and beauty.       
Edward sits off to the side as Bella addresses them.              

                          BELLA
              I think the only fair way to handle                 
              this is by vote --
                          EDWARD
              You can't be serious --                             

                          BELLA
                   (firmly)
              This is my meeting, Edward.

Edward, frustrated, sits back.    She faces the family again.

                          BELLA
              However this turns out, I'm not                     
              letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go               
              back to Italy alone --                              

                                                            111.



                            EMMETT
                The hell you will.   I'm not missing
                another fight.

                            BELLA
                That's not up for a vote, Emmett.    I
                don't want you involved.

                            ESME
                We've always been involved, honey, and
                we're not going to stop --

                            BELLA
                No, please -- I want you to seriously
                think about this. If I join you,
                you'll be stuck with me for a long
                time - forever. It's a huge decision.
                And I want - I need your honesty here.

They nod or otherwise communicate agreement.

                            BELLA
                Then let's take a vote... Alice?

Alice jumps up and hugs Bella.

                            ALICE
                Like you're not already my sister.     Of
                course, yes!

Bella smiles.   Jasper rises, but keeps his distance.

                            JASPER
                I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to
                want to kill you.

                             BELLA
                Um.   Thanks? Okay, Rosalie?
Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her.

                            ROSALIE
                Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I
                really am. And I know you're not
                ready to forgive me...
                     (to Bella)
                But this isn't the life I'd have
                chosen for myself. I wish there'd
                been someone to vote no for me...
                     (she exchanges a glance
                      with Carlisle - then...)
                So... no.

                                                            112.



Bella takes it stoically.    Emmett bounds over and lifts           
Bella into a bear hug.

                          EMMETT
              I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight
              with these Volturi some other way.

Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly.

                          ESME
              I already think of you as part of the
              family. Yes.

                          BELLA
              Thank you, Esme.
Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --

                            CARLISLE
              Edward --

                          EDWARD
              You can't go along with this,
              Carlisle, you know what it means.

                          CARLISLE
              You've chosen not to live without her,
              which leaves me no choice. I won't
              lose my son.
                   (turns to Bella)
              But Alice has never turned anyone.
              It'd be safer if I did it --

The front door suddenly SLAMS. Edward's gone.     Bella
blanches but turns to the family.                                   

                            BELLA
              Thank you.    Thank you all.

POV FROM AFAR ON A HILLTOP -- REVEAL IT'S VICTORIA watching         
the house down below. Off her seething fury --                      

                                                    SMASH TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FERRARI has pulled over to the side of the road. VICTORIA
PEERS IN THE WINDOW. The DRIVER, a middle-aged man smiles --        

                          VICTORIA
              Where you headed?

                                                           113.



                            DRIVER
              Seattle.                                             

                          VICTORIA
                   (a slow grin)                                   
              Sounds perfect.                                      

As she climbs in...                                                

INT. EDWARD'S CAR - MORNING

Edward drives Bella home.    He is somber.   She is resigned.      

                            EDWARD
              When?
                          BELLA
              After graduation.                                    

                          EDWARD                                   
              Just two months.                                     

                          BELLA
              It'll be best for Dad that way. I can                
              pretend to be at college somewhere.                  
              Carlisle suggested it. But...                        
                   (quiet, emotional)                              
              I wish you'd be the one to change me.                

                          EDWARD
                   (beat)
              Would you be willing to trade for that?

                         BELLA
                   (hopeful)                                       
              Name it.

                          EDWARD
              Five more years as a human.

                          BELLA
              The Volturi won't wait that long.

                          EDWARD
              I'll settle for three.                               

                          BELLA
                   (sadly, shakes her head)
              I won't risk it. It'll have to be
              Carlisle.

He takes her hand.

                                                           114.



                          EDWARD
              Why are you so willing to give up your
              soul?

                          BELLA
              Because I don't believe you've lost
              yours. And I want to share mine with
              you forever.

He looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward           
SLAMS on the brakes --

THEIR POV - THE ROAD

-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them --
it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods.
                          BELLA
              What is he doing?

                          EDWARD
              He wants to talk to me.

                          BELLA
              Well, he can talk to me first.

She pushes out of the car --

INT. WOODS - MORNING

Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob
leaning against a tree. His expression is hard.

                          JACOB
              You're still alive.                                  

                          BELLA                                    
              I've been calling you.                               
                          JACOB
              Couldn't drop by?                                    

                          EDWARD
              He thinks I'm keeping you away.

                          JACOB
                   (spinning on him)
              Stay the hell out of my head!

                          BELLA
              Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying                  
              to get back before he wakes up.                      

                                                           115.



Jacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward
takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic.

                          EDWARD
              Jacob, I know you have something to
              say to me, but I'd like to say
              something first. Alright?

Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting.

                          EDWARD
                   (sincere)
              Thank you. For keeping Bella alive
              when I... didn't.

                          JACOB
              No, you didn't. And it wasn't for
              your benefit, trust me.

                          EDWARD
              I know. I'm still grateful.
                   (then)
              But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving
              Bella's side till she orders me away.

She looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the              
devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it.

                           JACOB
              We'll see.

                          EDWARD
              Either way, we'll handle Victoria from
              here on out.

                          JACOB
              She's been laying low. Ever since
              your freaky sister showed up. Guess
              she can't stand you Cullens either.

                          EDWARD
              She'll come back.

                          JACOB
              She does, she's ours.   She killed on
              our turf.

                           EDWARD
              We'll see.

                          JACOB                                    
              My turn to talk. I'm here to remind
              you about a key point in the Treaty.

                                                          116.



                          EDWARD
                   (reads his thoughts, nods)
              I haven't forgotten.

                          JACOB
              Good.

                           BELLA
              What?   What key point?

                          JACOB
              If any of them bites a human, the
              truce is over. That's bite, not kill.

                          BELLA
                   (realizing)
              But... if I choose it, it's none of
              your business.

Jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.

                          JACOB
              If you... what!? No.      No way.   I
              won't let you --

                          EDWARD
              -- Bella, step back --

                          JACOB
              You're not gonna be one of them.

                          BELLA
              That's not your call --

                          JACOB
                   (even more intense)
              You know what we'll do to you - I
              won't have a choice --
                          EDWARD
              We're done here --

Edward takes Bella's arm, starts to pull her away.    Jacob
lunges, trying to extract Bella from him --

                          JACOB
              You don't speak for her!

Edward PUSHES Jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air,
but mid-air he PHASES INTO A WOLF!

                                                         117.



-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face
Edward in an attack stance. Edward shifts stance, as well,
readying for a fight --

                          BELLA
              Stop!

Edward and Jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging --

                          EDWARD
                   (to Bella)
              Get out of here. Now!

But Bella races between them, forceful, insistent.

                          BELLA
                   (to both of them)
              You do this, you'll be going through me.

A long tense beat, none of them backing down - it could go
either way --

                          BELLA
              I swear to God, I'm not moving.

Both rivals see she's dead serious. Edward backs off, ever-
so-slightly... the Jacob-wolf does the same.                     

                          BELLA
                   (turning to Edward)
              Give me a second. Please.

Edward shakes his head.   Doesn't move an inch.

                          BELLA
              Read his thoughts.   Is he going to                
              hurt me?
Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his        
eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.

Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf, blocking his line
of sight. Her voice is kind, pleading.

                          BELLA
              Jacob, I love you. You're my best
              friend. But... I can't change how I
              feel. Please don't make me choose.
                   (quietly, emotionally)
              Because it'll be him. It's always
              been him.

                                                           118.



Anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face.    It's even
harder to take than when he's in human form --

                          BELLA
              But you know how important you are to --

Suddenly, the wolf BOLTS out of there...

ON BELLA - fighting tears as she watches him disappear...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              There were problems ahead.     Seemingly             
              insurmountable...                                    

Edward's arms wrap around her from behind.                         
                          BELLA (V.O.)
              ... If I didn't become a vampire, the
              Volturi would kill me. If I did, my
              best friend would do the job himself,
              or get killed in the attempt.

She turns to face Edward, looking into his loving eyes...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Victoria was still on the loose,
              putting everyone I loved in danger...

He kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But I'd already survived the worst --
              losing Edward. So I knew I could
              survive anything...

                           EDWARD                                  
              I'm here.   Always.
And she sees that's the truth, believes it. He takes her
hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face
              our fate together. Forever.

Off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to --

                                               FADE TO BLACK:

INT. CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON

Women's casual wear department. J.C. Penny.

Legend "1961"

An African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the
department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at
the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON

A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches.

A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and
clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained.

She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it,
but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING.

She's just given birth.

There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her
with quiet smiles.

A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags.

				 SALESWOMAN
		This is Mr. Mathison. He's
		a doctor.

DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman.

				 DR. MATHISON
		You okay?

The woman nods, "Yes." Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES
ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM.

				 SALESWOMAN
		An ambulance is on the way.

Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and
gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Is there a name yet?

Beat. The woman smiles for the first time.

				 WOMAN
		Elijah.

She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES
SEEM TO GET LOUDER.

				 WOMAN
		Is he supposed to be crying
		like that?

The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.

The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down
and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time.

				 WOMAN
		Can I have him back?

THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat.

The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the
woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body.

He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.

				 DR. MATHISON
		What happened during the
		delivery?

His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Nothing. It was very quick.
		The baby just wanted to come
		right out. There was no
		problems.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop him?

Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE
BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop this baby?

Beat.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Jesus Christ, no.

The BABY SCREAMS.

The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the
saleswoman who brought him in.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Please inform the ambulance
		we have a situation...

Dr. Mathison turns back to the mother. Beat.

				 DR. MATHISON
		I've never seen this... It
		appears your infant
		sustained some fractures
		while in your uterus.
			(beat)
		His arms and legs are
		broken.

EXT. TRAIN STATION NEW JERSEY - DAY

LEGEND "PRESENT DAY"

A fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform.

Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes... Women
traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as
they move... College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various
track numbers.

				 ANNOUNCER(o.s.)
		Last call track three,
		Amtrak Clocker making it's
		final stop at Philadelphia's
		thirtieth street station.
		First two passenger cars
		only. First two cars only.

A face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the
escalators. DAVID DUNNE, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the
glass and quietly observes the movement outside.

The train starts to pull out.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PASSENGER CAR - DAY

David sits with his coat on his lap. He's wearing a tie. He doesn't look very
comfortable in it.

He feels a stare. He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at
him from over the seat in front of him. She just gazes at him blankly.

He gives her a small forced smile. She doesn't react. David returns his head to
the window.

His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		You alone?

David looks in the direction of THE VOICE. A WOMAN with dark hair and light blue
eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. She's wearing a tight
white t-shirt and jeans. She's beautiful.

David nods "yes."

The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. She stretches to
get them up. Her toned stomach is exposed. She has a silver ring pierced through
her navel.

David has a gold ring on his hand. He fiddles with it. Beat. He gently slips off
his wedding band. It goes into his coat pocket.

The woman takes the seat next to him.

Beat. A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. The passenger car shakes as a passing
train barrels by two feet from David's window. It passes in a few seconds. The
car returns to a QUIET HUM.

David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him.

He holds the woman's fashion magazine out.

				 DAVID
		Someone left these. You want
		one?

The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports
Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.

David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.

				 DAVID
		You like sports?

				 WOMAN
		It's my field. I represent
		athletes. I'm an agent.

				 DAVID
		What a coincidence? I'm a
		male synchronized swimmer
		and I'm looking for
		representation.

				 WOMAN(smiling)
		Is that right?

				 DAVID
		But I'm afraid of water, so
		that's been holding my
		career back a little bit.

The woman laughs.

				 DAVID
		You represent someone in
		Philadelphia?

				 WOMAN
		I'm meeting a player from
		Temple University. He's a
		cornerback. You like
		football?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Not really.

				 WOMAN
		This kid is six foot two,
		two hundred and forty
		pounds. He runs the fifty in
		under six seconds. He's
		going to be a God.

Beat. David studies the excitement in her eyes.

ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. David waits till the opposing train passes.
The woman goes back to her magazine. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I'm David Dunne.

The woman looks up.

				 WOMAN
		Kelly.

She goes back to the magazine.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How long are you staying in
		Philly?

KELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David.
Beat.

She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger.

				 KELLY(soft)
		I'm married.

				 DAVID(fake excitement)
		Great.

Beat.

				 KELLY
		Sorry.

				 DAVID(fake confusion)
		What are you talking about?

An awkward silence.

				 DAVID
		I think you got the wrong
		idea.

The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine.

				 KELLY
		I'm going to find another
		seat.

Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She
starts to the back of the car.

David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water.

He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the
seats.

David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his
coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on.

His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes
closed... Beat.

David's head bounces lightly against the window.

The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close.

He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.

He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat.

David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the
train is picking up speed.

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.

The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN.

The train goes faster.

AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO
TAKE A CURVE.

David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer
watching him.

DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop
away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE...

THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE
TRACK...

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON

A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television
upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red
face. He changes channels with a remote control.

He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops
on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat.

His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto
the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF
A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes.

Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a
notepad. On it is written...

"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm."

Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters
that move from right to left are words and numbers..."The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed...Amtrak"

Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise
that no one hears.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured
helpless scream.

MEGAN DUNNE continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as
far as it will go.

She counts to three and eases off. She lays her arm back in her lap.

WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. About a dozen people are on specialized
weight machines.

The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.

				 MEGAN
		You okay, Virginia?

Beat. VIRGINIA shakes her head, "No."

				 MEGAN
		I'll put something on the
		t.v. Maybe we'll find some
		almost naked guys to inspire
		you.

Megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. She turns it on and
starts flipping channels. She stops on ESPN where a swimming meet is underway.
Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool.

Virginia starts watching with great interest.

Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. Her
face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON

DAVID DUNNE'S EYES SLOWLY OPEN. THE DULL WHITE OF THE OVERHEAD TUBE LIGHTING
BLINDS HIM AT FIRST.

He blinks his vision back. He realizes he's in a bed.

WE HEAR AGITATED VOICES, MOVEMENT.

David looks around. He's in an emergency room. There are a half dozen prep areas
and beds next to him. They're all empty.

DAVID FOLLOWS THE URGENT SOUNDS OF ACTIVITY TO A PREP AREA DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM
HIM.

He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. A group of
emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on
a gurney.

One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. He
notices David sitting up from across the room.

THE MAN IN SCRUBS leaves the group and walks over.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		How are you feeling?

				 DAVID
		Okay.

He FLASHES A LIGHT in David's eyes.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You are in the emergency
		room of the University of
		Pennsylvania Hospital. You
		were in a serious accident.
			(beat)
		How's your vision?

				 DAVID
		Fine.

David stares across as the scene with the other patients becomes more frantic and
disturbing.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Where were you sitting on
		the train?

				 DAVID
		Against a window.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		In the passenger car?

				 DAVID
		Yes. Where are the rest of
		the passengers?

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Was your family traveling
		with you?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Did you get up from your
		seat?

				 DAVID
		No.

David watches the other patient.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You're certain you were in
		the passenger car?

David turns to the man.

				 DAVID
		Yes... Why are you looking
		at me like that?

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Your train derailed... Some
		kind of malfunction... It
		took a curve way to fast. A
		second train collided with
		yours after it derailed. The
		debris is spread over one
		mile. It's unbelievable they
		said.
			(beat)
		They only found two people
		alive so far... You and him.

David looks to the other passenger now laying unnaturally still in the desperate
whirlwind of activity around him.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		The man's skull was cracked
		open and most of his left
		side was crushed.

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		And to answer your question,
		there are two reasons why
		I'm looking at you like
		this.

David turns and stares at the man.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		One, because it seems, in a
		few minutes, you will
		officially be the only
		survivor of this train
		wreck.
			(beat)
		And two, because you don't
		have a scratch on you. You
		didn't break one bone.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY RECEPTION AREA - EVENING

David moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital. He opens a
set of double doors.

A room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement.

A CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE.

				 JEREMY
		I told you!

Jeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out
and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands
there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed.

Hospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back.

Jeremy tugs David to lean down. He does.

				 JEREMY
		They thought everybody on
		the train died.

David looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek.

				 JEREMY
		I told them they were wrong.

A woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne.

				 JEREMY
		Mom even cried.

David looks at Megan's eyes.

				 JEREMY
		A lot.

Megan looks away.

				 MEGAN
		Not a lot.

They stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand.

				 JEREMY
		Let's go home.

Megan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to
life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse
of David Dunne.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

David eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen. He stares at his hand.
Opens and closes it slowly. Beat.

He rises and puts the bowl away in the sink.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

David stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the
bottom of the stairs. The doorway is half open. He makes eye contact with his
wife. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I don't think I got the job
		in New York.

				 MEGAN
		What does that mean?

				 DAVID
		I'm still going to New York.
		Just not this second.

				 MEGAN
		I don't want to drag this
		out too long for Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		I know.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How about in the meantime,
		you don't sleep in the
		guestroom anymore?
			(beat)
		You sleep in our room. I'll
		sleep down here.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		It stopped being our room a
		long time ago.
			(beat)
		You should go up and get
		some rest.

Beat. Megan slowly closes the door to the guest bedroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

David looks at his son asleep in his bed.

				 DAVID
		Jeremy, why don't you go
		sleep with your mom?

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I want to sleep here
		tonight.

				 DAVID
		I think it's be better if I
		was alone.

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I won't make any noise.

				 DAVID
		How about your room then? If
		you get scared like before,
		you can come back in here?

Beat. Jeremy doesn't answer because he's asleep. David rubs his forehead and gets
up. He turns on the t.v., low volume, as he moves into the bathroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Hot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower. His attention is
drawn to the t.v. which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door.

He turns off the water to HEAR.

				 NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
		...Derailed approximately
		seven and half miles outside
		Philadelphia. It came to
		rest on its side on the
		northbound tracks. It is
		train officials belief that
		some if not most of the

		at this time.

				 NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)

		only a few seconds. A Boston
		bound freight train on the
		northbound tracks was
		seconds away from passing
		train 177 when it derailed.
		The impact happened at about
		three-fifteen p.m. The first

			(beat)
		Rescue teams will be working
		for the next forty-eight
		hours removing bodies and
		debris.

David steps out of the shower. He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed. David
shuts the door. Locks it.

He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on.

He closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat
on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat.

His muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying.

								FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. FAIR - DAY

LEGEND "1969"

A hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking
lot of the local high school.

A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms.

The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line.
She is older and somehow more beautiful.

She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy
wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized
stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF
VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful
rides in the parking lot.

The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.

Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic
bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.

				 MOTHER
		We'll play the water pistol
		game next.

Elijah nods, "Yes" happily.

The mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of
women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah
doesn't like it. He moves away from the line.

A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows
the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.
CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.

For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.

He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.

A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.

Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... "The Hurricane."

He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull
the metal bars down in front of them.

The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.

Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under
the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.

Elijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment
and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.

He looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His
expression changes.

Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their
softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's
wedged in between them. Feels good.

He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah
looks a little anxious. Beat.

He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before
he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.

Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an
eight year old smile of pride.

AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.

He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her
calling.

				 MOTHER
		Elijah...

She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The
Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes
immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.

Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.

A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.

Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.

				 ELIJAH
		I won't get hurt momma! I'm
		safe!

HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.

The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped
man. She's pointing at Elijah.

The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's
angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.

And then the ride speeds up.

The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.

Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.

Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on.

Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him
and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed
animal.

Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over
the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.

Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.

THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.

THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions
suddenly.

Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the
compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR
SOMETHING CRACK.

TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.

The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling
clouds in a mixture of agony and terror.

The ride changes directions.

Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest.
WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.

The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the
floor of the compartment.

And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual
stop.

THE TEENAGERS MOAN.

Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.

WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		His bones... He's not
		well...

HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		Elijah baby...

Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to
scream.

Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The
other is curved horrifically like an "s". His mouth is open. His eyes are
bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year
old child about to black out from the pain.

								FADE TO BLACK:

PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across
from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are
recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church.

David is among the arriving crowd.

				 MAN(o.s.)
		David Dunne!

At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter
called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as
the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face.

David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, "Services for
the families and friends of train 177."

		Glen Stevens, researcher in
		the area of Leukemia at
		Drexel University. We pray
		for your soul.

David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church. His eyes drift
to a woman two rows ahead of him. She's turned around, looking at him. Her eyes
are red  from crying.

David looks away. His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats
away. Father, mother and daughter stare silently.

David surveys the entire church... Desperate inconsolable eyes question his
existence from every direction.

David has to look down.

				 PRIEST
		...Jennifer Pennyman, third
		grade teacher at Jefferson
		Elementary.
			(beat)
		We pray for your soul.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BACK OF CHURCH - AFTERNOON

David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation
room. The priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot.

				 DAVID
		I used to play football in
		college. In my first year as
		quarterback, we went on this
		winning streak. It just went
		on and on. It didn't matter
		who we played... I'd always
		win.
			(beat)
		You get superstitious when
		something like that happens.
		You give things meaning.
		Like you wear the same color
		socks each game or you
		listen to the same B.B. King
		song before you leave the
		apartment. I wouldn't even
		untie the shoelaces on my
		cleats. I'd just slip them
		on and off so nothing would
		change... I gave things
		meaning that had no meaning.
			(beat)
		I'm here to make sure I'm
		not making shoelaces into
		something they're not again.
			(beat)
		I was the only person to
		survive that accident. The
		only one... It feels like it
		means something.

Beat.

				 PRIEST
		Are you a religious man,
		David?

David nods, "No."

The priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before
folding it carefully.

				 PRIEST
		Good. Because I'm going to
		talk to you as a man. Not as
		a man of the cloth.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

Beat. The priest turns to David.

				 PRIEST
		It was luck.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		What do you mean?

				 PRIEST
		Luck... Random... Without
		meaning.

David just sits awkwardly.

				 PRIEST
		Three years ago, my cousin
		died on a plane that crashed
		on take off at Philadelphia
		International airport. Do
		you remember that crash?

David nods, "Yes."

				 PRIEST
		I prayed and prayed and
		finally found some meaning
		in the event. It gave me
		peace... And then not quite
		a year later, an entire
		family from my parish burned
		to death in a hotel fire
		downtown...
			(beat)
		Again I prayed. Again I
		found  meaning.
			(beat)
		Just two days ago, my nephew
		rode with you on that train
		back from New York. He was
		traveling alone for the
		first time.

				 PRIEST
		I'm sorry if I can't react
		to your survival with the
		appropriate 'It was the hand
		of God. It was a miracle.'
		kind of answer... I'm fresh
		out of those right now.

David is shaken. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		The metal of the watch I was
		wearing was crushed like a
		sledge hammer hit it.

Beat. The priest's eyes fill with emotion.

				 PRIEST
		My twelve year old nephew's
		neck was broken in four
		places... What's your point?
		You were chosen?
			(beat)
		I don't think so.

The priest turns and continues putting away artifacts from the mass. Silence
fills the back room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

No cameras greet his exit. No people anywhere.

David walks across the now empty parking lot. His car is the only one left.

He walks to the driver's side. Pulls out his keys. That's as far as he gets.

His eyes catch sight of the GRAY ENVELOPE tucked under the windshield wiper of
his car.

David moves forward and gently pulls it out. His name is typed on the front. He
turns it over. Two embossed words on the back.

				 "Limited Edition"

He opens the envelope. One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index
card.

The line reads...

  "How many days of your life have you been sick?"

Nothing else is written.

David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A
bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels
on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone.

David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They
all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on
all their backs...

"Stadium Security"

This ritual goes on without a word.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING

David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As
he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty
sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside.

David stops at a door marked "PERSONNEL".

								  CUT TO:

INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING

David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the
personnel office.

The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and
never looks up as she talks.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Yes?

				 DAVID
		Is Noel in?

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		No sir he is not.
			(beat)
		I read about you in the
		paper.

				 DAVID
		Oh.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I was in an accident once
		too. A horse almost trampled
		me to death.

				 DAVID
		Wow.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I had to put him down.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		That's a sad story.
			(beat)
		Do you think you could ask
		Noel something for me?

The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it
over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Proceed.

				 DAVID
		Ask if he can check how many
		sick days I've taken since
		I've worked here?

Beat.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Is that the entire message?

				 DAVID
		Yes.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON

Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.

David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He
stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches
the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely
see David's face under the hood.

There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem
unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on
the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched
behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships."

David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of
activity on the sidelines. Beat.

David steps out into the rain.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON

A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's
rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence.

David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight
circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just
stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat.

				 DAVID
		You know what I think about
		to calm down? I think about
		those big fat, hundred and
		twenty pound turtles that
		live in the islands. Those
		suckers never get angry,
		never get in fights and live
		longer than all of us and
		all they do all is sit on
		the beach and hump other
		turtles.
			(beat)
		Why don't we take a second
		and think about the turtles?

Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment.

				 FATHER
		Yeah Jerry why don't you
		think about the fat ass
		turtles... Like your fat ass
		son on the field
		jeopardizing the rest of our
		chances at a fucking
		championship.

David tenses. Everyone looks to JERRY. A bald man who stands just a foot away.
Jerry nods to himself. Looks like he's going to say something. Instead he lunges
forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him.

David tackles Jerry hard and fast. He drives him into the ground.

Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt.

The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. The remaining security
guard calls on his walkie for assistance.

David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the
man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field.

David's eyes are not on Jerry. They gaze out onto the field where twenty two
elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off,
rain washing over their faces. They watch in horror as their parents attack each
other on the sidelines.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

David is the last one left. He's showered and back in his street clothes. He sits
in the dimly lit room on the bench, lost in his thoughts when the door opens.

He turns to find a somewhat pregnant looking man with a tie step in. This is
NOEL.

				 DAVID
		Hey Noel.

Beat. He just stares.

				 NOEL
		Forty dollars.

David turns on the bench.

				 DAVID
		What?

				 NOEL
		You're getting a forty
		dollar raise per week...
		that's it.

Silence.

				 NOEL
		I checked. You were right.
		You've never taken a sick
		day.
			(beat)
		Five years, no sick days. I
		get it. You want a raise.
		You made your point.

The room is still. Beat.

				 NOEL
		All right fifty dollars and
		that's the god damn limit.
			(beat)
		Are we done here?

Beat. David nods, "Yes."

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

LIGHTS OUT.

David is wide awake in his bed. He glances over. Jeremy is in deep sleep next to
him.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

David knocks again quietly. The guest bedroom door opens.

Megan looks up at David. She's just woken up.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is Jeremy okay?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		He's asleep.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Oh.

Beat. They both stand awkwardly for a moment.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I wanted to ask you a
		question. It'll sound
		strange, but just think
		about it for a second.

Megan nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When's the last time I was
		sick? You remember?

Megan tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		I don't know. It's been a
		while.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I haven't been sick this
		year. I know that.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Okay.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Do you remember me getting
		sick?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Not a specific day. What's
		this about?

				 DAVID (low voice)
		Megan, do you ever remember
		me getting sick?

Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		In the three years we've
		been in this house?... In
		the old apartment?... Before
		Jeremy was born?... Before
		we were married?

Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...I can't remember.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		That's strange isn't it? Not
		remembering one fever... Or
		a cold... Or a sore throat.
		What do you think that
		means?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		It means we're probably to
		tired to remember.

David becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is that what you wanted to
		ask me?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yes.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is there anything else you
		wanted to ask me while I'm
		up?...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...When was the last time
		you wore pink? When was the
		last time you drank soup
		standing up? Final call for
		strange questions at two in
		the morning.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		No that's it.

David seems lost in his thoughts.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Maybe you should go up.
		Jeremy might see you're gone
		and get frightened.
			(beat)
		The train thing, really
		shook him up. He's scared
		something's going to happen
		to you. He doesn't want to
		let you out of his sight.

David stares at Megan. Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yeah. I know.

There's silence for a bit.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When was the last time I
		wore pink?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		The Mitchell barbecue three
		years ago.

				 DAVID(realizing)
		Oh shit...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Matching shirt and shorts.
		It was brutal.

David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Goodnight Megan.

Megan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Goodnight David.

Megan closes the door slowly shut.

								FADE TO BLACK:

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom.

LEGEND "1974"

A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a
small black and white television in the corner of the room.

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a
moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off.

The room GOES SILENT.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		No more sitting in this
		room. I've let it go on long
		enough.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm not going out anymore.
		I'm not getting hurt again.
		This was the last time. I
		told you.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You can't do anything about
		that. You might fall between
		that chair and this
		television. If that's what
		God has planned for you,
		that's what's going to
		happen. You can't hide from
		it in your room.

Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen.

				 ELIJAH
		They call me Mr. Glass at
		school. Cause I break like
		glass.

Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat.

Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...You make this decision
		now to be afraid...
			(beat)
		And you'll never turn back
		your whole life. You'll
		always be afraid.

Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her
face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...I got a present for you.

				 ELIJAH
		Why?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Forget why. Do you want it
		or not?

Elijah thinks it over. He nods, "Yes."

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Well, go get it then.

				 ELIJAH
		Where is it?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		On a bench, across the
		street.

Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You calling me a liar?

She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in
the room.

The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the
street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it.

There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN
PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it.

Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window.

				 ELIJAH
		Someone's gonna take it.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Then you better get out
		there soon.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

Elijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running
about him.

He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package
on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.

He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper
together. He unfolds the paper. Beat.

Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap.

He feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I bought a whole bunch.
		They'll be one of these
		waiting for you, every time
		you want to come out here.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		They said this one has a
		surprise ending.

Elijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a
moment.

He looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page...

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STORE - DAY

The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown
into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.

He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are
depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is
extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.

				 MAN
		This is from Fritz
		Champion's own library. This
		is before the first issue of
		the comic book hit the
		stands in 1968.

Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the
sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		It's a classic depiction of
		good versus evil. Notice the
		square jaw of Slayer -
		common in most comic book
		heroes. And the slightly
		disproportionate size of
		Jaguaro's body to his head.
		This again is common, but
		only in villains... The
		thing to notice about this
		piece... The thing that
		makes it very, very
		special... is its realistic
		depiction of its figures.
		When the characters
		eventually made it into the
		magazine they were
		exaggerated... as always
		happens.
			(beat)
		This is vintage.

The business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Wrap it up.

				 ELIJAH
		You've made a considerably
		wise decision.

Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art
gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My kid's gonna go berserk.

Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns.

				 ELIJAH
		Once again please?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My son Jeb. It's a gift for
		him.

				 ELIJAH
		How old is Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Four.

				 ELIJAH
		No.

Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.

				 ELIJAH
		No, no, no, no no... You
		need to go now.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What did I say?

				 ELIJAH
		Do you see any Telletubbies
		around here?... Do you see
		a slender plastic tag
		clipped to my shirt with my
		name printed on it?... Do
		you see a little Asian child
		with a blank expression
		sitting outside in a
		mechanical helicopter that
		shakes when you put a
		quarter in it?... No?...
		Well that's what you see at
		a toy store? Any you must
		think this is a toy store,
		cause you're in here
		shopping for an infant named
		Jeb. One of us has made a
		gross error and wasted the
		other person's valuable
		time...

Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man.

				 ELIJAH
		This is an art gallery my
		friend. This is piece of
		art...

Elijah points at the sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		This is one of seventeen
		original drawings by Fritz
		Champion remaining in the
		world. It's value will
		triple every year... This
		piece is to be treasured. To
		be cherished... To be
		coveted by every single one
		of your banker friends that
		think they're better than
		you.

The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What if I kept it?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm listening.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I'll keep it in my office
		room.

				 ELIJAH
		What about Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I have a lock on the door.

Elijah just stares.

				 ELIJAH
		Will it be near a window?

				 BUSINESSMAN
		No direct sunlight will fall
		on it.

Elijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Come back in three days.
		I'll think about it.

Elijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in.
Elijah talks over his shoulder to them.

				 ELIJAH
		We're by appointment only.

				 MAN
		I received a card from your
		store.

				 ELIJAH
		Congratulations, you have a
		mailbox... The sale isn't
		for two weeks.

				 MAN
		This one was under the
		windshield of my car.

Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with
Jeremy.

Elijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them.
When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.

				 ELIJAH
		You've never been sick?

				 DAVID
		I don't know for sure.
			(beat)
		...I don't think so.

David and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Well if this ain't a riddle
		worthy of the Riddler?

								  CUT TO:

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the
store. The words, "Limited Edition" are etched in the window.

David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane
is on his lap.

Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup.

				 ELIJAH
		So let's get some of the
		usual questions out of the
		way. Why am I using a cane?
		Raise your hand if you were
		thinking that.

Jeremy raises his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		I fractured my leg. It's the
		fifth time I've done that
		particular bone. It didn't
		really heal well this time.

				 ELIJAH
		Raise your hand is you're
		wondering who the hell
		breaks the same bone five
		times?

Jeremy and David raise their hands.

				 ELIJAH
		I have something called
		Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
		It's a genetic disorder. I
		don't make this particular
		type of protein very well
		and it makes my bones very
		low in density, very easy to
		break. I've had fifty-four
		breaks in my life. I have
		the tamest version of the
		disorder... Type one.
			(beat)
		There are type two, type
		three, and type four. Type
		four's don't make it very
		long...
			(beat)
		That ends our lecture on the
		medical anomaly known as
		Elijah Price.

Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners.

				 ELIJAH
		How certain are you that you
		haven't been sick in your
		life?

				 DAVID
		Seventy-five percent.

				 ELIJAH
		Seventy-five percent? That's
		not nearly good enough for
		me. I'm extremely skeptical.

				 DAVID
		Skeptical about what?

				 ELIJAH
		Your answer to my question.
		It's one thing to have never
		been injured in your life,
		but to state that you've
		never taken ill, well that's
		a whole new level.

				 JEREMY
		Dad's been injured.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		What's he talking about?

				 DAVID
		In college. A car accident.

				 ELIJAH
		Was it serious?

David nods.

				 JEREMY
		He couldn't play football
		anymore.

Beat. Elijah looks shaken.

				 ELIJAH
		I assumed because of the
		train.

				 DAVID
		You assumed wrong.

Elijah closes his eyes. When his eyes open, the life force in them has
diminished. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		It's over.
			(beat)
		You can go now.

Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the store.

INT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy enter the store. Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of
the framed sketches. He gazes at it quietly.

				 DAVID
		I think you skipped a couple
		steps.

Elijah turns.

				 DAVID
		You forgot the "Now I'm
		going to tell you what the
		hell is going on" step. See
		usually that comes before
		the, "It's over" Step. And
		it always, always comes
		before the "You can go"
		Step.
			(beat)
		What is over?

				 ELIJAH
		The life of an idea that has
		lived too long in my head.

David stares at Elijah impatiently.

				 ELIJAH
		There are probably only four
		or five individuals in the
		world who can claim more
		knowledge of comics than
		myself. I've spent a third
		of my life in a hospital bed
		with nothing else to do but
		read. I have studied the
		form intimately. I have seen
		the patterns in them... The
		references to social and
		cultural events and the
		atmosphere that surrounded
		them. I've come to believe
		that comics are our last
		link to the ancient way of
		passing on history.

				 ELIJAH
		The Egyptians drew pictures
		on walls about battles, and
		events. Countries all around
		the world still pass on
		knowledge through pictorial
		forms.
			(beat)
		I believe that comics, just
		at their core now... have a
		truth. They are depicting
		what someone, somewhere felt
		or experienced. Then of
		course that core got chewed
		up in the commercial machine
		and gets jazzed up, made
		titillating - cartooned for
		the sale rack.

Elijah gazes at David.

				 ELIJAH
		This city has had its share
		of disasters. Well
		publicized ones. It was
		around the time of that
		plane crash, when it first
		entered my head. And there
		it stayed, as I waited and
		watched the news over the
		years...
			(beat)
		And then one day I see a
		news report on a train
		accident and its sole
		survivor who was
		miraculously unharmed.
			(soft)
		And just like that, an idea
		blossoms into the flower of
		possible reality.

				 DAVID
		What was your idea Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		If there is someone like me
		in the world, and I'm at one
		end of the spectrum...
		Couldn't there be someone
		the opposite of me, at the
		other end?
			(beat)
		A person who can't be hurt
		like the rest of us. A kind
		of person they were talking
		about in those stories.

Elijah points at the framed comic sketches.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		A person they believed was
		put here to protect the rest
		of us. Guard us.

				 JEREMY
		You thought my dad was a
		real-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy don't take another
		sip of that drink.

Jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands.

				 DAVID
		Throw it in the trashcan
		near the door and wait for
		me outside. Do it now
		please.

David waits for Jeremy to exit the store. Beat.

				 DAVID
		At the church... You were
		following me weren't you?

				 ELIJAH
		Technically no. I gambled
		that you would attend the
		church service. I just
		waited for you.

David glares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		What's this about? This is
		obviously some scam. Is this
		where you tell me one of
		those pictures is like an
		investment?

				 ELIJAH
		You've misunderstood.

				 DAVID
		I see guys like you all the
		time in my work. You find
		someone you think is
		emotionally vulnerable and
		you tell them a fantastic
		story, utterly convincing...
		and somewhere in there, you
		slip it in... 'I just need
		your credit card number','I
		just need a small down
		payment.'

David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat.

				 DAVID
		Did you know that this
		morning was the first
		morning I can remember, that
		I didn't open my eyes and
		feel that sadness... Do you
		know what I'm talking about?
		That little bit of sadness?
			(beat)
		I thought the person that
		wrote that note had an
		answer for me. For why I
		survived that train. For why
		my life feels so out of
		balance...
			(beat)
		But I guess that's what you
		were counting on.

Elijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance.
Jeremy watched through the window concerned.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to leave now.
			(beat)
		Good luck with your sale.

Elijah watches David walk towards the front door.

				 ELIJAH
		What type of job do you have
		David?

David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah.

				 ELIJAH
		You mentioned you've met
		'guys like me' in your work.
			(beat)
		What type of job would that
		be?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I work at the stadium as a
		security guard.

Beat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as
Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street.

Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE.

David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands.

Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs.

David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently...

  "TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR"

Beat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake
up.

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door.

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the
narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T
FALL ON JEREMY.

There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a
small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf.

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a
handgun.

He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the
highest shelf.

He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE
SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD.

He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a
young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The
word "Champion" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings
- all are images and stories of David and football.

He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded
over three times, unlike the others. He opens it.

It's a newspaper headline. It reads...

"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED"

David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the
font is similar.

David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and
heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb
seems to flicker. David is utterly still.

SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled.

He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it
back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.

ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door.

Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Hi.

Megan nods. Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		I've come to a decision.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Oh.

Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Let me just ask you
		something okay? And you can
		be totally honest. I'm
		prepared for any answer. It
		won't affect me...

David nods, "yes."

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Have you been with anyone?
		Since we started having
		problems? The answer won't
		affect me.

Beat. David stares at his wife.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		It won't affect me either
		way.

Beat. David doesn't say anything. He just nods, "No."

Megan's face starts to tremble. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very
affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		...My decision is... I'd
		like to start again. Pretend
		we're at the beginning.
			(beat)
		It's a big deal you walked
		away from that train. It's
		a second chance.
			(beat)
		If you want to ask me out
		sometime, that would be
		okay.

Megan nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her
disappear into the shadows.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERAN'S STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Sunday afternoon. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky.
The Philadelphia Eagles pro football players are in uniform and doing stretches
on the field. The opposing team warms up on the other end of the field.

The sixty thousand seats are already half filled as fans stream in on every level
of the stadium.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are
ripping tickets.

David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards.

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles
paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he
tilts his head sideways. "We sleep with quarterbacks," is written in block
letters.

David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is
wearing an eagles uniform.

The WALKIE TALKIE on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip an
listens.

				 WALKIE
		Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got
		a guy at gate 17C with a
		bogus ticket. Says he knows
		you. He won't tell me his
		name.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		What's he look like?

				 WALKIE
		He's got the most beautiful
		eyes... The hell kind of
		question is that? He's a
		guy.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Send him packing. I'm not
		walking all the way over
		there.

				 WALKIE
		Consider him packed. I
		didn't like his attitude...
		Struttin around with a cane
		and shit.

Beat.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Hold up Jenkins...

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 17C - AFTERNOON

David finds Elijah waiting to the side as the crowds funnel through the gate.
Elijah offers his hand as he walks up. David doesn't take it.

				 ELIJAH
		They said I couldn't get in
		with my ticket.

Elijah offers him the ticket. David inspects it.

				 DAVID
		It's for last week's game.

				 ELIJAH
		I've come to understand
		that...
			(beat)
		An ill advised purchase in
		the parking lot.

David hands Elijah back the ticket.

				 DAVID
		What do you want?

				 ELIJAH
		Not money.
			(beat)
		But I appreciate your
		healthy cynicism in the
		manner. It will be wise for
		both of us to proceed with
		greatest caution.

				 DAVID
		We're not proceeding
		anywhere together.

				 ELIJAH
		We've already begun.

David looks around.

				 DAVID
		One more time. What is it
		you want?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Why is it, do you think,
		that of all the professions
		in the world... you chose
		protection?

				 DAVID
		Are you for real?

				 ELIJAH
		You could have poured coffee
		in Starbucks, you could have
		learned to install track
		lighting in office
		buildings, you could have
		told people their horoscopes
		on the internet... You could
		have been one of ten
		thousand things... but in
		the end, you chose to
		protect people. You made
		that decision... and I find
		that very, very interesting.
			(beat)
		Now all I need is your
		credit card number.

Beat. Elijah smiles.

				 ELIJAH
		That last part was a joke.

David fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I got this job because my
		college coach called the guy
		who manages the stadium.
		There's no hidden meaning to
		it.

David's walkie makes NOIES on his hip.

				 DAVID
		They need me at the gate.

David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick.

				 DAVID
		Did you really want to see
		the game? I can get you in.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity.

David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		It gets heaviest ten minutes
		before kickoff.

David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and
continues walking.

David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		Why don't we pat down?

David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to
him.

				 DAVID
		Just give me a minute.

				 ELIJAH
		Is there a problem?

				 DAVID
		That guy in green. Sometimes
		people carry weapons in
		here. Then they drink too
		much. They're team isn't
		doing so well, bad things
		happen... We do random pat
		downs of the crowd to
		discourage people from
		carrying.
			(beat)
		If he's carrying, he'll step
		out of line.

Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through
the turnstiles.

The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he
watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile.

David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten...

The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket
melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the
stadium.

								  CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in
causing long shadows.

Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself.

THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE
FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL.

David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket.

				 DAVID
		I got you a seat in the
		seven hundred level.
			(points straight up)
		It's nose-bleed territory,
		but at least you won't get
		spit on.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you know that man
		you bumped was carrying a
		weapon?

				 DAVID
		Probably the army jacket.
		Those guys carry hunting
		knives and stuff for show.

				 ELIJAH
		You thought he was carrying
		a knife?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I thought he was carrying
		something.

				 ELIJAH
		But not a knife?

				 DAVID
		I got this picture of a
		silver handled gun tucked in
		his pants.
			(beat)
		Like on t.v.

Elijah stares at David. THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS.

				 ELIJAH
		You have good instincts when
		it comes to things like
		that?

				 DAVID
		Like what?

				 ELIJAH
		Telling when people have
		done something wrong?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

				 ELIJAH
		Have you ever tried to
		develop it?

				 DAVID
		I don't know what you're
		asking?

				 ELIJAH
		You're skill.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Listen. I got to be on the
		sidelines during the game...
		You can get to your seat by
		taking the stairwell at-

				 ELIJAH
		Characters in comic books
		are often attributed special
		powers. X-ray vision, things
		of that sort.

David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		Okay, I don't want to play
		this game anymore.

				 ELIJAH
		It's an exaggeration of the
		truth. Maybe it's based on
		something as simple as
		instinct. Like being able to
		touch someone and tell
		whether they've done
		something wrong... Or the
		level of what they've done
		wrong.

				 DAVID
		The guy might not have been
		carrying anything.

				 ELIJAH
		Or he might have been
		carrying a silver handled
		gun tucked in his pants.

David's WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE.

				 DAVID
		I have to go now.

				 ELIJAH
		One last question.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Quick.

				 ELIJAH
		The car accident you were
		in... Was there anyone else
		involved?

The two men stand very still in the tunnel.

				 DAVID
		Yes. My wife Megan. She was
		in the car with me.

David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Have a good life Elijah and
		try to buy your tickets at
		an authorized sales
		location.

Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of
the tunnel.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin
foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every
corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of
his car in the parking lot of the stadium. He sits as thoughts crash at his head.
Beat.

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview
mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car.

Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out
of the parking lot.

Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Elijah's walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking lot.

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step.

Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the
hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his
pace through the lot.

He gains on the army jacket.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		Hold up for a second!

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the
end of the parking lot. He looks back at Elijah for a beat. Doesn't like what he
sees. He disappears into the subway entrance.

Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful.
He makes it with great strain to the subway.

He looks into the entrance...

A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket
is glimpsed before it disappears.

Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		I just want to ask you
		something!

Elijah's VOICE ECHOES down the stairs. No response.

Elijah starts his descent.

THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.

Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's
moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.

His hand slips away from the railing...

He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is
heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.

The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL
STAIRS.

He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway
landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF
THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.

His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The
green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing
through the turnstile.

The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat
riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out
from the belt of his pants.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK

David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus
pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his
security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE.

David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are
having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to
David.

				 JEREMY
		Was it sold out?

David nods, "No."

				 DAVID
		You know how mad your mom
		would be if she knew you
		were playing football?

Jeremy nods.

				 JEREMY
		Are you going to tell?

David nods, "No."

				 JEREMY
		You want yo play the last
		downs? We got a big guy like
		you. You can play on
		opposite sides.

David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who
stands with the other children.

				 JEREMY
		He's Potter's cousin. He's
		the starting corner back for
		Temple University.

David stares at his son.

				 JEREMY
		He going pro in the draft.
		They say he can run the
		fifty-

				 DAVID
		In under six seconds.
			(beat)
		I've heard.

David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of
the kids feel his flexed bicep.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to go in.

				 JEREMY
		Just play one set of downs.
		I told them you were great.

				 DAVID
		Why'd you do that?

				 JEREMY
		Just one-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy.
			(beat)
		I'm going in. I have to do
		some things.

				 JEREMY
		What things?

				 DAVID
		I'm going to work out.

				 JEREMY
		I'll help you.

				 DAVID
		There's nothing to do.

Jeremy turns back to the children and waves.

				 JEREMY(yells)
		I can't play! I'm working
		out with my dad!

Jeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand. David looks down at his son
who waits patiently.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old
bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner.

David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and
places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you rest now? I'll
		take it from here. You've
		been a big help.

Jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could beat up
		Mike Tyson? I mean before he
		started wiggin out and
		eating people's ears?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you worked out
		everyday for six months? You
		think you could beat him
		then?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you only ate foods
		that were good for you and
		you worked out everyday for
		a year?

Jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on the barbell and comes
around to David's end of the bench. David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the barbell. Beat. He takes a deep breath.

The weight comes off the armrests of the bench. David lowers it to his chest and
pushes it back up. He does just one more rep with serious strain. He puts the
weight back on the armrest and sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you put on
		there?

David twists around and looks back at the barbell. He counts up the black metal
circles. He turns back to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		You put too much. That's two
		hundred and fifty pounds.

				 JEREMY
		How much can you lift?

David looks back at the weights.

				 DAVID
		That's the most I've ever
		lifted.
			(beat)
		That could have been
		dangerous Jeremy. Why don't
		you go upstairs and let me
		finish up?

Jeremy starts back to the barbell.

				 JEREMY
		I'll take it off. I'll help
		you right.

He slips off the safety collar.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could have
		beaten up Bruce Lee?

David hears the SOUND OF THE WEIGHTS SLIDING OFF THE BAR BEHIND HIM.

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		I mean if you knew karate?

				 DAVID
		No Jeremy.

				 JEREMY
		What if he wasn't aloud to
		kick and you were really mad
		at him?

Jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around
to David.

David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the bar. Lifts it off the armrest. Brings it down. His arms
are straining hard again. He raises it and lowers it two time; it takes a sizable
effort. The weights bang down onto the armrest.

David sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you take off?

				 JEREMY
		I lied.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		You added?

Jeremy nods, "Yes" slowly.

David turns completely around and looks at the barbell. He counts the black discs
on the steel bar. Beat.

Nobody says anything for a long time.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

				 DAVID(soft)
		Two hundred and seventy.

David just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar. Jeremy comes and
sits on the bench next to his father. They both stare at the weight. Beat.

				 JEREMY(dead serious)
		Let's put more.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

David's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar. He leans his head forward
and looks to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you move back a
		bit? Just to be safe.

Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits.

Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm
rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin
to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely
onto the rest.

David sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat.

				 JEREMY
		More?

Beat. David nods, "Yes."

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

An enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar. David's hands are gripping the
metal.

He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without
looking at him.

				 DAVID
		You should never try
		anything like this. You know
		that right?

Jeremy nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID
		What do you do if something
		happens?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		Get mom.

David nods, "yes" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath.
CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His
face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up
again two times before dropping it onto the armrest.

He slowly sits up.

				 DAVID
		How many did you put on that
		time?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		All of it.

				 DAVID
		There's no more left?

Jeremy nods, "no" in a slight daze. Beat. David looks around his basement.

				 DAVID
		What else can we use?

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal
handles on the outside of each side of the weights.

The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms
are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It
touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales
powerfully as he straightens his arms.

The bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as
they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat.

David sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the
discs and the cans.

His lips stop moving. Beat.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

David doesn't react.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it dad?

It takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		About three hundred and
		forty.

David turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at
his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

David sits on the edge of the bathroom tub. He's just showered and wearing jeans
and a t-shirt. He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the
white tiles of the floor.

THE PHONE RINGS.

David gets up and walks out of the bathroom. He picks up the phone and stands in
the bathroom doorway.

				 DAVID
		Yeah, hello.

				 WOMAN(on phone)
		Is David Dunne there?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		Yes. Is this David?

				 DAVID
		Yeah? Megan where are you
		calling from?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		My name is Megan Inverso. We
		went to college together.

David looks at the phone. The lights for line ONE and line TWO are glowing RED.
David squints his eyes as he pieces together the situation. Beat.

He moves back into the bathroom. The cord stretches as he takes his seat on the
edge of the bathtub.

				 DAVID
		I remember you.

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		I was hoping you would call
		me, but... Anyway I decided
		not to wait.
			(beat)
		I was thinking, it might be
		nice to go to dinner
		together.

Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		...Hello?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yeah it might be nice.

We hear A SOUND ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. A SOUND MUCH LIKE AN EXHALE.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATE EVENING

The local Chinese restaurant. Red and gold plastic dragons hang from the ceiling.
A couple late-nighters are at the bar. Megan and David are two of a handful of
people left dining in the restaurant. They're a little dressed up. Megan looks
kind of stunning.

				 DAVID
		...When you work with
		clients on machines, do they
		sometimes just jump up a
		level or two? Do something
		they didn't know they were
		capable of?

				 MEGAN
		Not often, but it is
		possible. Most people get
		scared when they see the
		shadow of their limits. They
		don't know how long the
		shadow really is. They don't
		know how far away the real
		limits are standing... They
		stop out of fear.

David nods as he takes it in. Beat. He looks down at his plate and twirls his lo
mein onto a fork. Megan watches him.

				 MEGAN
		This is kind of strange
		isn't it?

David nods, "yes" before taking the bite.

				 MEGAN
		We're not even acting like
		ourselves.

David touches his mouth with his napkin.

				 MEGAN
		Like that. Your mouth's
		dirty. You tapped your
		napkin to your lips. You
		only do that when you're
		with someone you don't know.

David looks down at his napkin.

				 DAVID
		What do I do when I'm around
		someone I know?

				 MEGAN
		You use your sleeve.

They both smile at each other. Beat.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		Megan?

David and Megan look over to the only other table of late night diners as they
get up from their table. A woman about Megan's age walks over to her.

				 WOMAN
		I thought it was you.

				 MEGAN
		Hi.
			 (to David)
		This is Claire. Her son is
		in Jeremy's class. Claire
		and I worked on the school
		food drive together.

				 DAVID
		Hello.

CLAIRE smiles as she stares at David. She turns to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(mouths)
		He's cute.

Claire turns back to David.

				 CLAIRE
		I'm very happy about this.
		Megan mentioned to me she
		was considering dating
		again.

Megan becomes still.

				 CLAIRE(to David)
		I'm sorry, what's your name?

Beat. David doesn't look up.

				 DAVID
		David.

				 CLAIRE
		David?

				 MEGAN
		This is my husband.

Beat. All three people become frozen in silence.

Claire looks to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(soft)
		I am so sorry.

Megan nods.

Claire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the
restaurant. Beat.

Megan and David are the last one's left. They sit silently in their booth. Megan
looks at David's face. He's shaken.

He slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

It's late. NO LIGHTS ARE ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE HALL. The babysitter has black
dyes hair and Buddy Holly glasses. David waits as she puts on her jacket.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		He ate about six of those
		chocolate covered doughnut
		holes with his milk. He said
		he only had three, but I
		know he had six.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

David is not paying attention to the girl. He watches as his wife takes off her
coat and heads to the guest room. She turns before entering the room. David and
his wife make eye contact.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		Goodnight.

David nods. Megan goes into her room. The guest door closes softly.

David finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		My parents sleep in separate
		beds.

David reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money.

The baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door.

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM

David walks into the darkened child's bedroom. The lump on the bed turns when he
hears movement. He smiles when he sees David.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I'm sleeping in my room.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I see.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I'm not scared.

				 DAVID(soft)
		That's great.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		Do you know why?

David nods, "No."

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I know now.

				 DAVID(soft)
		Know what?

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		You're secret identity.

		That man was right.

Beat. David just stares at his son. Jeremy's eyes start to close.

				 DAVID
		Jeremy.

Jeremy opens his eyes.

				 DAVID(soft)
		There are big guys in almost

Beat. Jeremy's eyes start to shut.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		You could have lifted more.

Jeremy Dunne falls asleep. David Dunne stands in the darkness of his son's room.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Elijah's cheek rests against two pristine white pillows. He looks exhausted. His
eyes are fixed on some abstract point in the room. WE HEAR SOUNDS OF A HOSPITAL.

The torso of a PHYSICIAN can be seen on the other side of the bed. We hear him
speak but never see his face.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		...fracture of the proximal
		phalanx of the little finger
		as well as multiple
		fractures of the sixth,

		The worst of the injury,

				 ELIJAH
		They call me Mr. Glass.

Beat.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Who does?

				 ELIJAH
		Kids.

Elijah just keeps staring.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Shall I continue?

Beat. Elijah's head nods the slightest bit up and down.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Pins were placed throughout

A CO-WORKER finds Megan working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a
stationary bike.

				 JANIS
		Your ten o'clock is here.
		The hospital discharged him

				 MEGAN
		Thanks.

The co-worker takes Megan's position by the elderly man.

Megan crosses the physical therapy center. A man in a wheel chair waits by her
office. She walks up to him with a smile.

				 MEGAN
		Elijah right?

Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight. Under his shirt
we see the wrappings around his ribs. His left pinky is in a splint. He smiles
and nods, "yes" to Megan.

INT. STADIUM LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

David Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into
the players locker room.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room
has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment.

About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost
in their own pre-game rituals.

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and
removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down,
wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.

He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of
the large room not occupied by anyone.

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of
free weights sit behind the press.

David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either
side. Six in all.

David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing.
Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the
players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell
phones...

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off
the weight rack.

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...

And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.

David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.

He closes his eyes...

David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.

His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps
training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.

And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.

The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His
arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.

He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the
smallest of CLINKS.

David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs.

				 DAVID(whispers)
		Four ten... four
		forty-five...
			(beat)
		Five hundred.

Beat. David sits up in a daze.

He finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. Some of the
players have stood up. Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet
disbelief in their eyes.

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON

Megan and Elijah are in the far corner of the room. They're separated from the
other clients. Megan is seated on an exercise machine. Elijah is in his wheel
chair facing her.

				 MEGAN
		We're going to prevent any
		substantial atrophy of your
		good leg with this.

		It works the quadriceps.

				 ELIJAH
		How long have you been

Megan is taken off guard by the question. She stares at Elijah. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Twelve years.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you get together?

Elijah smiles warmly. Megan smiles softly back.

				 MEGAN
		A car accident.

Elijah smiles even bigger.

				 ELIJAH
		Now you're going to have to
		tell me more.

				 MEGAN
		...See my husband was a big
		football star in college and
		we were in an accident
		together. Our car flipped on
		an icy road. We were both
		injured. He couldn't play
		football anymore.
			(beat)
		If that hadn't happened, we
		wouldn't have been together.

				 ELIJAH
		How so?

				 MEGAN
		Football wasn't the kind of
		life I wanted... For ten
		years I'd be by the phone
		waiting for a call telling
		me he broke his neck in a
		practice game. And if it
		wasn't that call, it would
		be a call telling me he blew
		out his knee or suffered his
		third concussion. I've seen
		way too much of it in my
		job... I can barely take it
		when my clients are in pain.
			(beat)
		I don't hate the game. I
		admire the amount of skill
		it involved and, like
		everyone else, I was in awe
		of how he could play it, but
		I couldn't give him my heart
		and then have something
		happen to him. And it always
		does with that game.
			(beat)
		It's not a thing many people
		would understand.

				 ELIJAH
		You and my mother would have

				 MEGAN
		Any way, fate stepped in and

				 ELIJAH
		...And everyone lived

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Sort of.

Beat.

INT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Eleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue
and gray on the field. A sold out stadium watches the event.

David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the
second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the
bathrooms and concession stands and back again.

David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against
the wall. He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the
tunnel.

Beat. His shoulder leaves the wall. He STEPS OUT into the stream of people.
Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move.

David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening.

He continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the
movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass.

And then it happens... A stocky woman bumps into him.

FLASH CUT: AN IMAGE OF THE STOCKY WOMAN IN A BATHROBE STANDING IN A KITCHEN.
SHE'S HOLDING THE SHOULDER OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY STANDING NEXT TO HER. HE'S

We're back with David in the crowd. He turns and watches the stocky woman walk

				 MEGAN
		And what was that

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		It's a mediocre time Mrs.

		Is this a religious thing?

David's face to the security emblem on his shirt. The man's face becomes still.

The gray eyed man stands eerily still with his nachos and drinks. The two men
just stare at each other, evaluating the situation. People move in both
directions around them, unaware.

The gray eyes man holds his tray of food to the side and raises his arms slowly.

David steps forward and reaches into his pockets. Beat. David pulls his hands out
from the pockets. They're empty.

The gray eyes man brings his arms down. Beat.

The walkie on David's hip COMES TO LIFE. David reaches down and pulls it off his

GAP BETWEEN THE GLASS OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW AND THE DOOR. THE DOOR UNLOCKS.

THE MAN LOOKS AROUND QUIETLY BEFORE ENTERING THE CAR.

SLAM CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:

David looks over his shoulder at the conservative looking man in a shirt and tie
walking down the street.

David Dunne is shaken. He turns and keeps walking.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

A superhero action figure and a plastic villain do battle on Jeremy's desk.

David sits dressed up in a white shirt and dress pants. He holds the villain.
Jeremy holds the superhero.

Megan enters the room in a beautiful brown dress.

				 MEGAN
		The sitter's here.

David nods, "yes." Megan studies his tense expression.

				 MEGAN
		We can do this another time
		if you want? I'm fine with
		anything.

David looks from the action figures, to his son's face to the face of his wife.
They both have the same quiet anxious expression. Beat.

				 DAVID
		But I put cologne on.

Megan smiles.

				 MEGAN
		Is that what that smell is?

Jeremy giggles.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT

An overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. We
are in a low-end comic book store. The walls are lined with shelves of comic
books. The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case.

THE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one
head is visible behind a low rack.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hey man it's twenty after.
		It's time to close. I gotta
		head.

The top of the man's head doesn't move. Beat.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		You better not be jacking
		off to the Japanese comics.
		I swear to God.

No response. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back.

As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair.
The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Listen man, I didn't know
		you were in-
			(beat)
		Just choose something all
		right?

Elijah doesn't react. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans
over.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hello. You understand
		English?

Ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Look man, I'm just gonna
		wheel you out. You can think
		about things outside on the
		sidewalk. I gotta get some
		chicken in me, you know what
		I'm saying?

Beat. The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling
him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics.

Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left
leg hits a rack of comic books. A handful of comics tumbles to the ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Shit.

The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again.
After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the
wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and
fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Dude, I don't care if you
		are in a wheelchair. If you
		do that again, I'm calling
		Five-O.

Beat. The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, "Yes." He straightens the
chair.

They move down the aisle. All is quiet... and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to
the left again. His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. Elijah
gets covered in comics.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		That's it crackerjack!
		You're going to sit your ass
		in jail now.

The Ponytail man moves to the front counter.

Elijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over. His eyes stare at a comic book
in his lap. His expression changes for the first time.

The Ponytail man finishes dialing. He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a
voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		How much is this one?

								  CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

LATE EVENING. A trendy restaurant. Not enough light to read the menus.

David and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat. They sip their drinks as
they appear in deep thought.

				 DAVID
		...I think rust.

				 MEGAN
		Rust?

				 DAVID
		As a color, not as rust. You
		know, a rust colored paint
		or wood?

Megan leans slightly closer.

				 MEGAN
		I didn't know that. Mine's
		still brown.

				 DAVID
		My turn. What's your
		favorite song?

				 MEGAN
		Soft and Wet, by the Artist
		Formerly Known as Prince.

				 DAVID
		What was that?

				 MEGAN
		We're supposed to be honest.

Beat. David brings his stool closer.

				 DAVID
		Soft and Wet. That's very
		interesting.

				 MEGAN
		My turn.
			(beat)
		When was the first time the
		thought popped into your
		head that we might not make
		it?

David's grin slowly fades.

				 DAVID
		That's not the game.

Megan moves her stool closer. They're only a foot or so apart.

				 MEGAN
		It's a second date. There
		aren't any rules.

Beat. David sips his drink slowly.

				 DAVID
		I'm not sure.

				 MEGAN
		Think carefully?

				 DAVID
		What about the game?

				 MEGAN
		It's finished. I won.

Beat. David glances at Megan. She waits for his answer.

				 MEGAN
		Maybe it wasn't a specific
		moment, maybe it-

				 DAVID
		I had a nightmare one night
		and I didn't wake you up so
		you could tell me it was
		okay.
			(beat)
		I think that was the first
		time.
			(beat)
		Does that count?

				 MEGAN(soft)
		That counts.

Beat. Megan takes her glass up to her lips. Doesn't take a sip. Brings it back
down.

				 MEGAN
		Do you knowingly keep Jeremy
		and me at a distance?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

Megan's face tenses. She's on the verge of getting upset.

				 MEGAN
		Why?

				 DAVID
		I don't know Megan.

				 MEGAN
		It's like you resent us
		David. Resent the life you
		have.

Beat. David doesn't answer.

				 MEGAN
		You know even if it meant we
		couldn't be together, I
		would never have wished that
		injury on you? What you
		could so physically was a
		gift. I would never have
		wished it to go away.

Megan's eyes glaze with water. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		You know that right?

David takes a sip with a trembling hand. David's eyes look up and make eye
contact with Megan's. He stares at her for the longest time.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I know.

Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second
date.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Megan stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the
black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		You got two calls. One came
		through while I was on the
		line - I wasn't talking too
		long. There was an emergency
		with my sister. She tried to
		do her own perm and now she
		looks like-

				 DAVID
		Who called through?

Megan tries to hide her smile.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Someone from New York.

The smile instantly fades.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		About a security job at a
		museum. They want to hire
		you.
			(beat)
		I didn't know you guys were
		moving to New York. Thanks
		for telling me.

				 MEGAN
		We're not moving.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Oh.
			(beat)
		I let the answering machine
		pick up the other call.

The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly
quiet faces.

David hands her the money. She opens the door. It's started to rain.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Great.

The babysitter covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway. David
closes the door. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Look let's be honest here.
		We're just at the beginning.
		I don't expect you or I to
		change the course of where
		our lives were headed
		because of two dates.
			(beat)
		If you do go to New York, we
		can still develop this.
		We'll just be forced to take
		it slow. And in the end,
		that's definitely better.
			(beat)
		This is our second time
		around David. I don't expect
		us to get carried away.
			(beat)
		I guess congratulations is
		the right thing to say.

Megan takes off her coat as she moves to the guest bedroom. She disappears
inside. The door closely behind her.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Only the COUNTER LIGHT is on in the kitchen. David stands by the phone.

ELIJAH'S VOICE IS HEARD ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

				 ELIJAH(on tape)
		...David. It's Elijah. It
		was so obvious. It's
		referred to over and over.
		That's the key you see. The
		repetition across time. That
		means at some point it was
		all based on common thought,
		a common event - a fact.
			(beat)
		It was this one issue that
		brought it back for me...
		Century Comics
		One-Seventeen. That's where
		this group, the Coalition of
		Evil, tried to ascertain the
		weakness of every superhero.

				 ELIJAH(on tape)
		...Because they all have
		one.
			(beat)
		Just like you.
			(beat)
		The cells that make up your
		muscles and your bones react
		to forces that act upon it,
		slightly different from than
		mine. That's clear... Your
		cells react to bacteria and
		viruses slightly differently
		than mine... That's also
		clear...But for some reason,
		you and I react the exact
		same way to water. We
		swallow it, we choke. We
		swallow too much of it, we
		drown. However unreal it may
		seem, we are connected, you
		and I, we are on the same
		curve... just on opposite
		ends.

				 ELIJAH
		The point of all this is, we
		now know something we
		didn't... You have a
		weakness... Water. It's your
		krpytonite.
			(beat)
		You hearing me David? Call
		me back... I got rugby
		practice in an hour.

THE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS
OFF.

David hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before
ANNOUNCING.

				 MACHINE
		Message erased.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two
identical sinks sit opposite each other.

David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze
staring at the tiled floor.

His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of
the sinks.

David rises and picks it up.

It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit
on its edge.

David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he
hesitates.

His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A
CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS...
COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT...

David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own
identical mirrored medicine cabinet.

There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND
COLOGNE.

David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT.

David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt.

He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word
"security" is almost faded away.

He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT

Rain falls like gunfire from the sky.

David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot.

David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT

A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of
interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate
with a lock stops his progress.

David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a
construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area
next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station
grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can
only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away
from the immaculately lit train station.

Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the
fence door that holds him back from going down.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the
body of the caved-in passenger car.

The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line,
the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows
exposing the ravaged interior.

David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the
wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face.

His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow
breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE.

								  CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: EXT. STREET - NIGHT

SILENCE. BLACK. OUR VISION CLEARS TO REVEAL the glazed icy top of a street.

THE SOUND OF DISTANT FIRE COMES INTO THE SILENCE.

A TWENTY YEAR OLD DAVID DUNNE rises to his feet from the ground where he was
laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield. He looks down at himself. His
football jacket is torn. So are his jeans... He's trembling slightly, but not
bleeding.

HE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE NOISES.

About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole.
It's front is on fire.

Through one of the crushed door windows, WE SEE A WOMAN'S HAND.

Young David heads toward his car. He slips a couple of times on the slick iced
surface of the road.

He kneels down next to the inverted car. He looks in the crushed window frame.

THE FACE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD MEGAN IS UPSIDE DOWN. She is unconscious.

				 DAVID
		Megan...

She doesn't answer. Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel.

David pulls at the handle of the mangled door. It's wedged tight. It won't move.

The heat from the fire is tremendous.

David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength.

WE HEAR THE CREAK OF METAL... THE DOOR BENDS UNNATURALLY AND THEN PRACTICALLY
RIPS OPEN.

David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the
steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding.

David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road. He lays her
down gently.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

He just stares at her. She doesn't respond.

A LIGHT WASHES OVER THEM. David turns to see a truck approaching up the road.
David waves frantically. The truck slows.

David turns back to Megan. Her eyes are open.

Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes. She looks at
David.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		I thought I was dead.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Me too.

The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David.

				 DRIVER
		Is she all right?

				 DAVID
		I think her leg is
		fractured.

				 DRIVER
		Are you injured?

Beat. David looks at Megan who lays shivering in the grass. He looks back at the
driver.

				 DAVID(soft)
		My shoulder's hurt.

The driver nods.

				 DRIVER
		Hold on. I got a C.B. in the
		truck.

The driver moves back to his truck.

David takes Megan's hand in his and waits in the grass by the sight of their car
on fire.

								  CUT TO:

PRESENT: EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

David stands utterly still in the graveyard of train 177.

								  CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the SOUND OF
THE PHONE RINGING.

He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There
are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat
piles.

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath.

				 ELIJAH
		Hello.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		David?

Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN
OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		What am I supposed to do?

Elijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a
football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a
misty hand painted ceiling.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		David, it's okay to be
		afraid. Because this part
		won't be like a comic
		book... Real life doesn't
		fit into little boxes that
		were drawn for it.

David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and
departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic
throughout the station.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		Go to where people are...
		You won't have to look very
		long.

David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them.

He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It
watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier
to heaven.

David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving
passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as
they move.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES
STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE.

SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS
COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards
the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving.

David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information
board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady
spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side.

David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines
of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either
side of him.

David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side.
His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by.

Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt
and slicked back hair brushes by...

FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S
HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER.

				 SLICKED HAIR MAN
		Go back to Africa!

THE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY
WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the
information booth. He watches him for a beat.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A
GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS.

				 TEENAGER
		What's your name? I think
		you drank too much.

THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP
HER THIGH.

THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING
BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and
greets a group of identically dressed friends.

Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep
breaths as he gathers himself.

Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing
behind him.

David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus.

FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR.
HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW
FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Can I come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		Who are you?

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		I like your house. Can I
		come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What is this?
			(beat)
		No you can't come in.

Beat.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Are you sure?

The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it.
The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him.

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What are you doing?

The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening...
It opens slowly anyway.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable.

David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing
shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and
then finally onto the man.

He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive.
He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM.

The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the
full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full
trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.

David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station
Maintenance Staff Only".

Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his
bin inside.

David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the
longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the
doors.

And then they open.

The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's
wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit.

David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city
block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at
this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet
behind.

The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The
uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves.

He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail
out of the mailbox.

David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He
stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks
over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled
house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.

								  CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps
into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or
three days worth.

David shuts the door very slowly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE
KITCHEN.

David stares out from under his hood at the mess.

Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of
unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits
frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of
colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.

David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets
closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open
quietly.

A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom
of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the
flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies
folded over itself on his still chest.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in
a pyramid on the coffee table.

David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense.

THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and
follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM.

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are
everywhere. The room is empty.

A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists
with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms
pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest.

Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and
seated in the same way.

Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes
half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded
figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping
water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them.

They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them.
They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them.
They boy blinks once slowly.

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.

				 DAVID
		You need to leave now.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes
hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on
top of it.

David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the
other side of the bedroom.

A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped
against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable
bruises on her face and arms.

David stands before her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		Where is he?

The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The
curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside.

David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony.
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it.

David steps onto the balcony and looks down.

The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers
a pool in the backyard.

David turns to go back inside.

A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.

The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into
David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing.

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly
towards the black tarp.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. POOL - NIGHT

David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp.

There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his
cheek. Half his face is covered in water.

Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets
pounded by the rain.

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water
as his pressure pushes the tarp down.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START.

David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.

The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.

One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the
edge of the pool.

And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the
tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.

								  CUT TO:

EXT.  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

David's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the
constricting black tarp. He's drowning.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED
IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.

The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place
around the edge of the pool.

The rain keeps falling.

The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with
every movement.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN. TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR
THE EDGE OF THE POOL. FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEY'RE HOLDING... A ROD OR
POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE.

David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.

The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the
pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the
pool's edge.

Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of
the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.

He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain
poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat.

He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing,
calming.

He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the
two small figures standing near the edge of the pool.

The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an
aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the
hooded figure.

No one says anything.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door
handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he
looks down at her.

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move
closer. Right behind him.

The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching
over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.

David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp
together like and iron vise. He squeezes.

The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.

David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back
violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard
stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.

The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.
David's arm remains locked around his throat.

The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.
He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The
room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.

And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in
David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate
blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.

The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.

David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his
tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE
APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.

David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just
dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the
carpet now.

David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the
man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.

David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw.
The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE
ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.

He moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone
cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		It's over now.
			(beat)
		Your children are fine.
		They're getting help.

He unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I'm going to go now.

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally
still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run
down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath
against his hand. Beat.

He rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom
of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position
against her bathroom door.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

The front door opens to SILENCE. The silhouetted figure of David steps into the
darkness of his home.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

The dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet
next to the family winter coats.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares
down at the shadowy figure of his son.

He pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room.

He doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to
disappear into the shadows of the room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Megan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow.

Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR.

She starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees
David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her.
No words are spoken.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT

They enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed.

She watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her.

He covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I had a bad dream.

David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes.

Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		It's over now.

She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

Downtown Philadelphia.

People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is
among them.

He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the
store are open.

A banner over the door reads, "Annual Sale."

								  CUT TO:

INT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY

The compact store is crowded with customers.

David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic
hero.

David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at
a framed sketch.

Beat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David.

				 WOMAN
		...See the villain's eyes.
		They're larger than the
		other characters'. They
		insinuate a slightly skewed
		perspective of how they see
		the world. Just off normal.

David stares at the drawing.

				 DAVID
		He doesn't look very
		threatening.

				 WOMAN
		That's what I said to my
		son. He said, there's always
		two kinds. The soldier
		villain who fights the hero
		with his hands, and then
		there's the real threat. The
		brilliant and evil arch
		enemy who fights the hero
		with his mind.

David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her
sixties who stands next to him.

				 DAVID
		Are you Elijah's mother?

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I am. I'm helping him with
		the sale.

				 DAVID
		It's a pleasure to meet you.
		I'm David Dunne.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		He's spoken of you. He says
		you're becoming friends.

				 DAVID
		We are.

David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers.

				 DAVID
		He's doing well today.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'm very proud of him.
			(beat)
		He's been through a lot in
		his life. A lot of ups and
		downs, a lot of bad spells.
		A couple I'd thought had
		broken him... I mean
		emotionally.
			(beat)
		They were bad... But he made
		it. Yes he did.

				 DAVID
		He's kind of a miracle.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Yes he is.

They both watch Elijah from across the room.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'll tell him you're here.

David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to
finish talking.

David turns back to the framed sketch. He looks at it with his hands in his
pockets. Beat.

David's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.

THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows.
He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the
machine. The machine has wheels.

David turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his
wheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes
negotiating.

David turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more
you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a
wheelchair.

David looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has
spotted David.

Beat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.

				 ELIJAH
		Did you see this?

Elijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.

There's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled
children behind him.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		It has begun.

David stares quietly at the sketch of himself.

				 ELIJAH
		When I saw it this morning.
		I felt a part of the world
		again.

Elijah looks down at the newspaper.

David hesitates and then reaches forward.

He reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.

FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE
AIRFIELD. HE'S CRYING.

SIRENS START SOUNDING THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT.

WAITING PASSENGERS START GETTING UP AND MOVING TO THE WINDOWS.

				 MAN
		What's going on?

Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured
eyes.

				 ELIJAH
		A plane just crashed.

								  CUT TO:

FLASH CUT: ELIJAH AND AN ELDERLY MAN IN A UNIFORM ARE SEATED IN A HOTEL BAR.

				 ELDERLY MAN
		I've worked here twenty-five
		years. I know all its
		secrets.

				 ELIJAH
		Secrets?

				 ELDERLY MAN(whispers)
		Like if there was ever a
		fire on floors one, two, or
		three... Everyone in this
		hotel would be burned alive.

ELIJAH LOOKS UP FROM HIS DRINK.

								  CUT TO:

FLASHCUT: ELIJAH LEAVES THE ENGINEERING ROOM OF AN AMTRAK TRAIN. HE PASSES THE
ENGINEER WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED WITH COFFEE.

				 ENGINEER
		Passengers aren't allowed in
		there.

Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David takes two unsteady steps back. Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes
down at the newspaper. He looks up to David.

				 ELIJAH(low voice)
		I almost gave up hope. There
		were so many times I
		questioned myself. I've made
		so many sacrifices but it's
		all been worth it.
			(beat)
		There are millions and
		millions or mediocre people
		in the world David. Isn't it
		great that we aren't one of
		them?

David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store.

Customers step between him and Elijah. Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked
from view.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

David emerges from the store slowly. He braces himself against a parked car and
then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze.

WE PULL BACK as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people,
walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city.

INT. CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON

Women's casual wear department. J.C. Penny.

Legend "1961"

An African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the
department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at
the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON

A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches.

A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and
clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained.

She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it,
but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING.

She's just given birth.

There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her
with quiet smiles.

A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags.

				 SALESWOMAN
		This is Mr. Mathison. He's
		a doctor.

DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman.

				 DR. MATHISON
		You okay?

The woman nods, "Yes." Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES
ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM.

				 SALESWOMAN
		An ambulance is on the way.

Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and
gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Is there a name yet?

Beat. The woman smiles for the first time.

				 WOMAN
		Elijah.

She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES
SEEM TO GET LOUDER.

				 WOMAN
		Is he supposed to be crying
		like that?

The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.

The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down
and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time.

				 WOMAN
		Can I have him back?

THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat.

The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the
woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body.

He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.

				 DR. MATHISON
		What happened during the
		delivery?

His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Nothing. It was very quick.
		The baby just wanted to come
		right out. There was no
		problems.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop him?

Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE
BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop this baby?

Beat.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Jesus Christ, no.

The BABY SCREAMS.

The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the
saleswoman who brought him in.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Please inform the ambulance
		we have a situation...

Dr. Mathison turns back to the mother. Beat.

				 DR. MATHISON
		I've never seen this... It
		appears your infant
		sustained some fractures
		while in your uterus.
			(beat)
		His arms and legs are
		broken.

								FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. TRAIN STATION NEW JERSEY - DAY

LEGEND "PRESENT DAY"

A fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform.

Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes... Women
traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as
they move... College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various
track numbers.

				 ANNOUNCER(o.s.)
		Last call track three,
		Amtrak Clocker making it's
		final stop at Philadelphia's
		thirtieth street station.
		First two passenger cars
		only. First two cars only.

A face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the
escalators. DAVID DUNNE, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the
glass and quietly observes the movement outside.

The train starts to pull out.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PASSENGER CAR - DAY

David sits with his coat on his lap. He's wearing a tie. He doesn't look very
comfortable in it.

He feels a stare. He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at
him from over the seat in front of him. She just gazes at him blankly.

He gives her a small forced smile. She doesn't react. David returns his head to
the window.

His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		You alone?

David looks in the direction of THE VOICE. A WOMAN with dark hair and light blue
eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. She's wearing a tight
white t-shirt and jeans. She's beautiful.

David nods "yes."

The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. She stretches to
get them up. Her toned stomach is exposed. She has a silver ring pierced through
her navel.

David has a gold ring on his hand. He fiddles with it. Beat. He gently slips off
his wedding band. It goes into his coat pocket.

The woman takes the seat next to him.

Beat. A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. The passenger car shakes as a passing
train barrels by two feet from David's window. It passes in a few seconds. The
car returns to a QUIET HUM.

David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him.

He holds the woman's fashion magazine out.

				 DAVID
		Someone left these. You want
		one?

The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports
Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.

David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.

				 DAVID
		You like sports?

				 WOMAN
		It's my field. I represent
		athletes. I'm an agent.

				 DAVID
		What a coincidence? I'm a
		male synchronized swimmer
		and I'm looking for
		representation.

				 WOMAN(smiling)
		Is that right?

				 DAVID
		But I'm afraid of water, so
		that's been holding my
		career back a little bit.

The woman laughs.

				 DAVID
		You represent someone in
		Philadelphia?

				 WOMAN
		I'm meeting a player from
		Temple University. He's a
		cornerback. You like
		football?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Not really.

				 WOMAN
		This kid is six foot two,
		two hundred and forty
		pounds. He runs the fifty in
		under six seconds. He's
		going to be a God.

Beat. David studies the excitement in her eyes.

ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. David waits till the opposing train passes.
The woman goes back to her magazine. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I'm David Dunne.

The woman looks up.

				 WOMAN
		Kelly.

She goes back to the magazine.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How long are you staying in
		Philly?

KELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David.
Beat.

She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger.

				 KELLY(soft)
		I'm married.

				 DAVID(fake excitement)
		Great.

Beat.

				 KELLY
		Sorry.

				 DAVID(fake confusion)
		What are you talking about?

An awkward silence.

				 DAVID
		I think you got the wrong
		idea.

The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine.

				 KELLY
		I'm going to find another
		seat.

Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She
starts to the back of the car.

David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water.

He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the
seats.

David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his
coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on.

His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes
closed... Beat.

David's head bounces lightly against the window.

The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close.

He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.

He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat.

David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the
train is picking up speed.

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.

The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN.

The train goes faster.

AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO
TAKE A CURVE.

David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer
watching him.

DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop
away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE...

THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE
TRACK...

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON

A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television
upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red
face. He changes channels with a remote control.

He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops
on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat.

His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto
the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF
A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes.

Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a
notepad. On it is written...

"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm."

Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters
that move from right to left are words and numbers..."The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed...Amtrak"

Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise
that no one hears.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured
helpless scream.

MEGAN DUNNE continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as
far as it will go.

She counts to three and eases off. She lays her arm back in her lap.

WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. About a dozen people are on specialized
weight machines.

The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.

				 MEGAN
		You okay, Virginia?

Beat. VIRGINIA shakes her head, "No."

				 MEGAN
		I'll put something on the
		t.v. Maybe we'll find some
		almost naked guys to inspire
		you.

Megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. She turns it on and
starts flipping channels. She stops on ESPN where a swimming meet is underway.
Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool.

Virginia starts watching with great interest.

Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. Her
face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON

DAVID DUNNE'S EYES SLOWLY OPEN. THE DULL WHITE OF THE OVERHEAD TUBE LIGHTING
BLINDS HIM AT FIRST.

He blinks his vision back. He realizes he's in a bed.

WE HEAR AGITATED VOICES, MOVEMENT.

David looks around. He's in an emergency room. There are a half dozen prep areas
and beds next to him. They're all empty.

DAVID FOLLOWS THE URGENT SOUNDS OF ACTIVITY TO A PREP AREA DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM
HIM.

He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. A group of
emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on
a gurney.

One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. He
notices David sitting up from across the room.

THE MAN IN SCRUBS leaves the group and walks over.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		How are you feeling?

				 DAVID
		Okay.

He FLASHES A LIGHT in David's eyes.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You are in the emergency
		room of the University of
		Pennsylvania Hospital. You
		were in a serious accident.
			(beat)
		How's your vision?

				 DAVID
		Fine.

David stares across as the scene with the other patients becomes more frantic and
disturbing.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Where were you sitting on
		the train?

				 DAVID
		Against a window.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		In the passenger car?

				 DAVID
		Yes. Where are the rest of
		the passengers?

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Was your family traveling
		with you?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Did you get up from your
		seat?

				 DAVID
		No.

David watches the other patient.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You're certain you were in
		the passenger car?

David turns to the man.

				 DAVID
		Yes... Why are you looking
		at me like that?

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Your train derailed... Some
		kind of malfunction... It
		took a curve way to fast. A
		second train collided with
		yours after it derailed. The
		debris is spread over one
		mile. It's unbelievable they
		said.
			(beat)
		They only found two people
		alive so far... You and him.

David looks to the other passenger now laying unnaturally still in the desperate
whirlwind of activity around him.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		The man's skull was cracked
		open and most of his left
		side was crushed.

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		And to answer your question,
		there are two reasons why
		I'm looking at you like
		this.

David turns and stares at the man.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		One, because it seems, in a
		few minutes, you will
		officially be the only
		survivor of this train
		wreck.
			(beat)
		And two, because you don't
		have a scratch on you. You
		didn't break one bone.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY RECEPTION AREA - EVENING

David moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital. He opens a
set of double doors.

A room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement.

A CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE.

				 JEREMY
		I told you!

Jeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out
and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands
there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed.

Hospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back.

Jeremy tugs David to lean down. He does.

				 JEREMY
		They thought everybody on
		the train died.

David looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek.

				 JEREMY
		I told them they were wrong.

A woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne.

				 JEREMY
		Mom even cried.

David looks at Megan's eyes.

				 JEREMY
		A lot.

Megan looks away.

				 MEGAN
		Not a lot.

They stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand.

				 JEREMY
		Let's go home.

Megan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to
life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse
of David Dunne.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

David eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen. He stares at his hand.
Opens and closes it slowly. Beat.

He rises and puts the bowl away in the sink.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

David stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the
bottom of the stairs. The doorway is half open. He makes eye contact with his
wife. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I don't think I got the job
		in New York.

				 MEGAN
		What does that mean?

				 DAVID
		I'm still going to New York.
		Just not this second.

				 MEGAN
		I don't want to drag this
		out too long for Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		I know.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How about in the meantime,
		you don't sleep in the
		guestroom anymore?
			(beat)
		You sleep in our room. I'll
		sleep down here.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		It stopped being our room a
		long time ago.
			(beat)
		You should go up and get
		some rest.

Beat. Megan slowly closes the door to the guest bedroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

David looks at his son asleep in his bed.

				 DAVID
		Jeremy, why don't you go
		sleep with your mom?

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I want to sleep here
		tonight.

				 DAVID
		I think it's be better if I
		was alone.

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I won't make any noise.

				 DAVID
		How about your room then? If
		you get scared like before,
		you can come back in here?

Beat. Jeremy doesn't answer because he's asleep. David rubs his forehead and gets
up. He turns on the t.v., low volume, as he moves into the bathroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Hot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower. His attention is
drawn to the t.v. which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door.

He turns off the water to HEAR.

				 NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
		...Derailed approximately
		seven and half miles outside
		Philadelphia. It came to
		rest on its side on the
		northbound tracks. It is
		train officials belief that
		some if not most of the
		passengers were still alive
		at this time.

				 NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
		The momentary peace lasted
		only a few seconds. A Boston
		bound freight train on the
		northbound tracks was
		seconds away from passing
		train 177 when it derailed.
		The impact happened at about
		three-fifteen p.m. The first
		of the two occupied
		passenger cars was severed
		in half and sent careening
		in two directions. The
		second of the passenger cars
		was crushed and dragged for
		four hundred feet. Six crew
		members were on the freight.
		One hundred and eighteen
		passengers and seven crew
		members were on the
		passenger train... There is
		one reported survivor.
			(beat)
		Rescue teams will be working
		for the next forty-eight
		hours removing bodies and
		debris.

David steps out of the shower. He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed. David
shuts the door. Locks it.

He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on.

He closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat
on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat.

His muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying.

								FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. FAIR - DAY

LEGEND "1969"

A hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking
lot of the local high school.

A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms.

The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line.
She is older and somehow more beautiful.

She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy
wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized
stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF
VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful
rides in the parking lot.

The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.

Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic
bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.

				 MOTHER
		We'll play the water pistol
		game next.

Elijah nods, "Yes" happily.

The mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of
women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah
doesn't like it. He moves away from the line.

A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows
the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.
CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.

For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.

He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.

A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.

Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... "The Hurricane."

He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull
the metal bars down in front of them.

The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.

Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under
the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.

Elijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment
and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.

He looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His
expression changes.

Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their
softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's
wedged in between them. Feels good.

He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah
looks a little anxious. Beat.

He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before
he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.

Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an
eight year old smile of pride.

AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.

He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her
calling.

				 MOTHER
		Elijah...

She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The
Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes
immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.

Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.

A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.

Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.

				 ELIJAH
		I won't get hurt momma! I'm
		safe!

HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.

The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped
man. She's pointing at Elijah.

The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's
angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.

And then the ride speeds up.

The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.

Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.

Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on.

Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him
and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed
animal.

Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over
the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.

Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.

THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.

THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions
suddenly.

Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the
compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR
SOMETHING CRACK.

TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.

The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling
clouds in a mixture of agony and terror.

The ride changes directions.

Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest.
WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.

The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the
floor of the compartment.

And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual
stop.

THE TEENAGERS MOAN.

Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.

WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		His bones... He's not
		well...

HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		Elijah baby...

Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to
scream.

Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The
other is curved horrifically like an "s". His mouth is open. His eyes are
bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year
old child about to black out from the pain.

								FADE TO BLACK:

PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across
from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are
recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church.

David is among the arriving crowd.

				 MAN(o.s.)
		David Dunne!

At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter
called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as
the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face.

David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, "Services for
the families and friends of train 177."

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

A PRIEST stands before a podium.

				 PRIEST
		Sarah Elaston, social worker
		at Broad and Locust
		Community Center. We pray
		for your soul.
			(beat)
		Kevin Elliott, business man,
		father of six. We pray for
		your soul.
			(beat)
		Glen Stevens, researcher in
		the area of Leukemia at
		Drexel University. We pray
		for your soul.

David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church. His eyes drift
to a woman two rows ahead of him. She's turned around, looking at him. Her eyes
are red  from crying.

David looks away. His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats
away. Father, mother and daughter stare silently.

David surveys the entire church... Desperate inconsolable eyes question his
existence from every direction.

David has to look down.

				 PRIEST
		...Jennifer Pennyman, third
		grade teacher at Jefferson
		Elementary.
			(beat)
		We pray for your soul.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BACK OF CHURCH - AFTERNOON

David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation
room. The priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot.

				 DAVID
		I used to play football in
		college. In my first year as
		quarterback, we went on this
		winning streak. It just went
		on and on. It didn't matter
		who we played... I'd always
		win.
			(beat)
		You get superstitious when
		something like that happens.
		You give things meaning.
		Like you wear the same color
		socks each game or you
		listen to the same B.B. King
		song before you leave the
		apartment. I wouldn't even
		untie the shoelaces on my
		cleats. I'd just slip them
		on and off so nothing would
		change... I gave things
		meaning that had no meaning.
			(beat)
		I'm here to make sure I'm
		not making shoelaces into
		something they're not again.
			(beat)
		I was the only person to
		survive that accident. The
		only one... It feels like it
		means something.

Beat.

				 PRIEST
		Are you a religious man,
		David?

David nods, "No."

The priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before
folding it carefully.

				 PRIEST
		Good. Because I'm going to
		talk to you as a man. Not as
		a man of the cloth.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

Beat. The priest turns to David.

				 PRIEST
		It was luck.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		What do you mean?

				 PRIEST
		Luck... Random... Without
		meaning.

David just sits awkwardly.

				 PRIEST
		Three years ago, my cousin
		died on a plane that crashed
		on take off at Philadelphia
		International airport. Do
		you remember that crash?

David nods, "Yes."

				 PRIEST
		I prayed and prayed and
		finally found some meaning
		in the event. It gave me
		peace... And then not quite
		a year later, an entire
		family from my parish burned
		to death in a hotel fire
		downtown...
			(beat)
		Again I prayed. Again I
		found  meaning.
			(beat)
		Just two days ago, my nephew
		rode with you on that train
		back from New York. He was
		traveling alone for the
		first time.

				 PRIEST
		I'm sorry if I can't react
		to your survival with the
		appropriate 'It was the hand
		of God. It was a miracle.'
		kind of answer... I'm fresh
		out of those right now.

David is shaken. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		The metal of the watch I was
		wearing was crushed like a
		sledge hammer hit it.

Beat. The priest's eyes fill with emotion.

				 PRIEST
		My twelve year old nephew's
		neck was broken in four
		places... What's your point?
		You were chosen?
			(beat)
		I don't think so.

The priest turns and continues putting away artifacts from the mass. Silence
fills the back room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

No cameras greet his exit. No people anywhere.

David walks across the now empty parking lot. His car is the only one left.

He walks to the driver's side. Pulls out his keys. That's as far as he gets.

His eyes catch sight of the GRAY ENVELOPE tucked under the windshield wiper of
his car.

David moves forward and gently pulls it out. His name is typed on the front. He
turns it over. Two embossed words on the back.

				 "Limited Edition"

He opens the envelope. One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index
card.

The line reads...

  "How many days of your life have you been sick?"

Nothing else is written.

David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A
bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels
on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone.

David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They
all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on
all their backs...

"Stadium Security"

This ritual goes on without a word.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING

David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As
he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty
sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside.

David stops at a door marked "PERSONNEL".

								  CUT TO:

INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING

David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the
personnel office.

The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and
never looks up as she talks.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Yes?

				 DAVID
		Is Noel in?

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		No sir he is not.
			(beat)
		I read about you in the
		paper.

				 DAVID
		Oh.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I was in an accident once
		too. A horse almost trampled
		me to death.

				 DAVID
		Wow.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I had to put him down.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		That's a sad story.
			(beat)
		Do you think you could ask
		Noel something for me?

The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it
over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Proceed.

				 DAVID
		Ask if he can check how many
		sick days I've taken since
		I've worked here?

Beat.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Is that the entire message?

				 DAVID
		Yes.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON

Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.

David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He
stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches
the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely
see David's face under the hood.

There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem
unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on
the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched
behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships."

David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of
activity on the sidelines. Beat.

David steps out into the rain.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON

A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's
rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence.

David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight
circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just
stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat.

				 DAVID
		You know what I think about
		to calm down? I think about
		those big fat, hundred and
		twenty pound turtles that
		live in the islands. Those
		suckers never get angry,
		never get in fights and live
		longer than all of us and
		all they do all is sit on
		the beach and hump other
		turtles.
			(beat)
		Why don't we take a second
		and think about the turtles?

Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment.

				 FATHER
		Yeah Jerry why don't you
		think about the fat ass
		turtles... Like your fat ass
		son on the field
		jeopardizing the rest of our
		chances at a fucking
		championship.

David tenses. Everyone looks to JERRY. A bald man who stands just a foot away.
Jerry nods to himself. Looks like he's going to say something. Instead he lunges
forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him.

David tackles Jerry hard and fast. He drives him into the ground.

Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt.

The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. The remaining security
guard calls on his walkie for assistance.

David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the
man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field.

David's eyes are not on Jerry. They gaze out onto the field where twenty two
elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off,
rain washing over their faces. They watch in horror as their parents attack each
other on the sidelines.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

David is the last one left. He's showered and back in his street clothes. He sits
in the dimly lit room on the bench, lost in his thoughts when the door opens.

He turns to find a somewhat pregnant looking man with a tie step in. This is
NOEL.

				 DAVID
		Hey Noel.

Beat. He just stares.

				 NOEL
		Forty dollars.

David turns on the bench.

				 DAVID
		What?

				 NOEL
		You're getting a forty
		dollar raise per week...
		that's it.

Silence.

				 NOEL
		I checked. You were right.
		You've never taken a sick
		day.
			(beat)
		Five years, no sick days. I
		get it. You want a raise.
		You made your point.

The room is still. Beat.

				 NOEL
		All right fifty dollars and
		that's the god damn limit.
			(beat)
		Are we done here?

Beat. David nods, "Yes."

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

LIGHTS OUT.

David is wide awake in his bed. He glances over. Jeremy is in deep sleep next to
him.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

David knocks again quietly. The guest bedroom door opens.

Megan looks up at David. She's just woken up.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is Jeremy okay?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		He's asleep.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Oh.

Beat. They both stand awkwardly for a moment.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I wanted to ask you a
		question. It'll sound
		strange, but just think
		about it for a second.

Megan nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When's the last time I was
		sick? You remember?

Megan tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		I don't know. It's been a
		while.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I haven't been sick this
		year. I know that.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Okay.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Do you remember me getting
		sick?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Not a specific day. What's
		this about?

				 DAVID (low voice)
		Megan, do you ever remember
		me getting sick?

Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		In the three years we've
		been in this house?... In
		the old apartment?... Before
		Jeremy was born?... Before
		we were married?

Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...I can't remember.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		That's strange isn't it? Not
		remembering one fever... Or
		a cold... Or a sore throat.
		What do you think that
		means?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		It means we're probably to
		tired to remember.

David becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is that what you wanted to
		ask me?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yes.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is there anything else you
		wanted to ask me while I'm
		up?...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...When was the last time
		you wore pink? When was the
		last time you drank soup
		standing up? Final call for
		strange questions at two in
		the morning.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		No that's it.

David seems lost in his thoughts.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Maybe you should go up.
		Jeremy might see you're gone
		and get frightened.
			(beat)
		The train thing, really
		shook him up. He's scared
		something's going to happen
		to you. He doesn't want to
		let you out of his sight.

David stares at Megan. Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yeah. I know.

There's silence for a bit.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When was the last time I
		wore pink?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		The Mitchell barbecue three
		years ago.

				 DAVID(realizing)
		Oh shit...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Matching shirt and shorts.
		It was brutal.

David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Goodnight Megan.

Megan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Goodnight David.

Megan closes the door slowly shut.

								FADE TO BLACK:

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom.

LEGEND "1974"

A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a
small black and white television in the corner of the room.

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a
moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off.

The room GOES SILENT.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		No more sitting in this
		room. I've let it go on long
		enough.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm not going out anymore.
		I'm not getting hurt again.
		This was the last time. I
		told you.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You can't do anything about
		that. You might fall between
		that chair and this
		television. If that's what
		God has planned for you,
		that's what's going to
		happen. You can't hide from
		it in your room.

Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen.

				 ELIJAH
		They call me Mr. Glass at
		school. Cause I break like
		glass.

Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat.

Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...You make this decision
		now to be afraid...
			(beat)
		And you'll never turn back
		your whole life. You'll
		always be afraid.

Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her
face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...I got a present for you.

				 ELIJAH
		Why?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Forget why. Do you want it
		or not?

Elijah thinks it over. He nods, "Yes."

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Well, go get it then.

				 ELIJAH
		Where is it?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		On a bench, across the
		street.

Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You calling me a liar?

She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in
the room.

The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the
street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it.

There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN
PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it.

Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window.

				 ELIJAH
		Someone's gonna take it.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Then you better get out
		there soon.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

Elijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running
about him.

He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package
on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.

He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper
together. He unfolds the paper. Beat.

Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap.

He feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I bought a whole bunch.
		They'll be one of these
		waiting for you, every time
		you want to come out here.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		They said this one has a
		surprise ending.

Elijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a
moment.

He looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page...

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STORE - DAY

The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown
into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.

He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are
depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is
extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.

				 MAN
		This is from Fritz
		Champion's own library. This
		is before the first issue of
		the comic book hit the
		stands in 1968.

Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the
sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		It's a classic depiction of
		good versus evil. Notice the
		square jaw of Slayer -
		common in most comic book
		heroes. And the slightly
		disproportionate size of
		Jaguaro's body to his head.
		This again is common, but
		only in villains... The
		thing to notice about this
		piece... The thing that
		makes it very, very
		special... is its realistic
		depiction of its figures.
		When the characters
		eventually made it into the
		magazine they were
		exaggerated... as always
		happens.
			(beat)
		This is vintage.

The business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Wrap it up.

				 ELIJAH
		You've made a considerably
		wise decision.

Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art
gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My kid's gonna go berserk.

Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns.

				 ELIJAH
		Once again please?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My son Jeb. It's a gift for
		him.

				 ELIJAH
		How old is Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Four.

				 ELIJAH
		No.

Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.

				 ELIJAH
		No, no, no, no no... You
		need to go now.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What did I say?

				 ELIJAH
		Do you see any Telletubbies
		around here?... Do you see
		a slender plastic tag
		clipped to my shirt with my
		name printed on it?... Do
		you see a little Asian child
		with a blank expression
		sitting outside in a
		mechanical helicopter that
		shakes when you put a
		quarter in it?... No?...
		Well that's what you see at
		a toy store? Any you must
		think this is a toy store,
		cause you're in here
		shopping for an infant named
		Jeb. One of us has made a
		gross error and wasted the
		other person's valuable
		time...

Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man.

				 ELIJAH
		This is an art gallery my
		friend. This is piece of
		art...

Elijah points at the sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		This is one of seventeen
		original drawings by Fritz
		Champion remaining in the
		world. It's value will
		triple every year... This
		piece is to be treasured. To
		be cherished... To be
		coveted by every single one
		of your banker friends that
		think they're better than
		you.

The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What if I kept it?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm listening.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I'll keep it in my office
		room.

				 ELIJAH
		What about Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I have a lock on the door.

Elijah just stares.

				 ELIJAH
		Will it be near a window?

				 BUSINESSMAN
		No direct sunlight will fall
		on it.

Elijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Come back in three days.
		I'll think about it.

Elijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in.
Elijah talks over his shoulder to them.

				 ELIJAH
		We're by appointment only.

				 MAN
		I received a card from your
		store.

				 ELIJAH
		Congratulations, you have a
		mailbox... The sale isn't
		for two weeks.

				 MAN
		This one was under the
		windshield of my car.

Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with
Jeremy.

Elijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them.
When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.

				 ELIJAH
		You've never been sick?

				 DAVID
		I don't know for sure.
			(beat)
		...I don't think so.

David and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Well if this ain't a riddle
		worthy of the Riddler?

								  CUT TO:

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the
store. The words, "Limited Edition" are etched in the window.

David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane
is on his lap.

Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup.

				 ELIJAH
		So let's get some of the
		usual questions out of the
		way. Why am I using a cane?
		Raise your hand if you were
		thinking that.

Jeremy raises his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		I fractured my leg. It's the
		fifth time I've done that
		particular bone. It didn't
		really heal well this time.

				 ELIJAH
		Raise your hand is you're
		wondering who the hell
		breaks the same bone five
		times?

Jeremy and David raise their hands.

				 ELIJAH
		I have something called
		Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
		It's a genetic disorder. I
		don't make this particular
		type of protein very well
		and it makes my bones very
		low in density, very easy to
		break. I've had fifty-four
		breaks in my life. I have
		the tamest version of the
		disorder... Type one.
			(beat)
		There are type two, type
		three, and type four. Type
		four's don't make it very
		long...
			(beat)
		That ends our lecture on the
		medical anomaly known as
		Elijah Price.

Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners.

				 ELIJAH
		How certain are you that you
		haven't been sick in your
		life?

				 DAVID
		Seventy-five percent.

				 ELIJAH
		Seventy-five percent? That's
		not nearly good enough for
		me. I'm extremely skeptical.

				 DAVID
		Skeptical about what?

				 ELIJAH
		Your answer to my question.
		It's one thing to have never
		been injured in your life,
		but to state that you've
		never taken ill, well that's
		a whole new level.

				 JEREMY
		Dad's been injured.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		What's he talking about?

				 DAVID
		In college. A car accident.

				 ELIJAH
		Was it serious?

David nods.

				 JEREMY
		He couldn't play football
		anymore.

Beat. Elijah looks shaken.

				 ELIJAH
		I assumed because of the
		train.

				 DAVID
		You assumed wrong.

Elijah closes his eyes. When his eyes open, the life force in them has
diminished. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		It's over.
			(beat)
		You can go now.

Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the store.

INT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy enter the store. Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of
the framed sketches. He gazes at it quietly.

				 DAVID
		I think you skipped a couple
		steps.

Elijah turns.

				 DAVID
		You forgot the "Now I'm
		going to tell you what the
		hell is going on" step. See
		usually that comes before
		the, "It's over" Step. And
		it always, always comes
		before the "You can go"
		Step.
			(beat)
		What is over?

				 ELIJAH
		The life of an idea that has
		lived too long in my head.

David stares at Elijah impatiently.

				 ELIJAH
		There are probably only four
		or five individuals in the
		world who can claim more
		knowledge of comics than
		myself. I've spent a third
		of my life in a hospital bed
		with nothing else to do but
		read. I have studied the
		form intimately. I have seen
		the patterns in them... The
		references to social and
		cultural events and the
		atmosphere that surrounded
		them. I've come to believe
		that comics are our last
		link to the ancient way of
		passing on history.

				 ELIJAH
		The Egyptians drew pictures
		on walls about battles, and
		events. Countries all around
		the world still pass on
		knowledge through pictorial
		forms.
			(beat)
		I believe that comics, just
		at their core now... have a
		truth. They are depicting
		what someone, somewhere felt
		or experienced. Then of
		course that core got chewed
		up in the commercial machine
		and gets jazzed up, made
		titillating - cartooned for
		the sale rack.

Elijah gazes at David.

				 ELIJAH
		This city has had its share
		of disasters. Well
		publicized ones. It was
		around the time of that
		plane crash, when it first
		entered my head. And there
		it stayed, as I waited and
		watched the news over the
		years...
			(beat)
		And then one day I see a
		news report on a train
		accident and its sole
		survivor who was
		miraculously unharmed.
			(soft)
		And just like that, an idea
		blossoms into the flower of
		possible reality.

				 DAVID
		What was your idea Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		If there is someone like me
		in the world, and I'm at one
		end of the spectrum...
		Couldn't there be someone
		the opposite of me, at the
		other end?
			(beat)
		A person who can't be hurt
		like the rest of us. A kind
		of person they were talking
		about in those stories.

Elijah points at the framed comic sketches.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		A person they believed was
		put here to protect the rest
		of us. Guard us.

				 JEREMY
		You thought my dad was a
		real-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy don't take another
		sip of that drink.

Jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands.

				 DAVID
		Throw it in the trashcan
		near the door and wait for
		me outside. Do it now
		please.

David waits for Jeremy to exit the store. Beat.

				 DAVID
		At the church... You were
		following me weren't you?

				 ELIJAH
		Technically no. I gambled
		that you would attend the
		church service. I just
		waited for you.

David glares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		What's this about? This is
		obviously some scam. Is this
		where you tell me one of
		those pictures is like an
		investment?

				 ELIJAH
		You've misunderstood.

				 DAVID
		I see guys like you all the
		time in my work. You find
		someone you think is
		emotionally vulnerable and
		you tell them a fantastic
		story, utterly convincing...
		and somewhere in there, you
		slip it in... 'I just need
		your credit card number','I
		just need a small down
		payment.'

David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat.

				 DAVID
		Did you know that this
		morning was the first
		morning I can remember, that
		I didn't open my eyes and
		feel that sadness... Do you
		know what I'm talking about?
		That little bit of sadness?
			(beat)
		I thought the person that
		wrote that note had an
		answer for me. For why I
		survived that train. For why
		my life feels so out of
		balance...
			(beat)
		But I guess that's what you
		were counting on.

Elijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance.
Jeremy watched through the window concerned.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to leave now.
			(beat)
		Good luck with your sale.

Elijah watches David walk towards the front door.

				 ELIJAH
		What type of job do you have
		David?

David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah.

				 ELIJAH
		You mentioned you've met
		'guys like me' in your work.
			(beat)
		What type of job would that
		be?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I work at the stadium as a
		security guard.

Beat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as
Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street.

Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE.

David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands.

Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs.

David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently...

  "TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR"

Beat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake
up.

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door.

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the
narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T
FALL ON JEREMY.

There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a
small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf.

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a
handgun.

He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the
highest shelf.

He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE
SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD.

He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a
young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The
word "Champion" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings
- all are images and stories of David and football.

He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded
over three times, unlike the others. He opens it.

It's a newspaper headline. It reads...

"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED"

David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the
font is similar.

David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and
heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb
seems to flicker. David is utterly still.

SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled.

He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it
back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.

ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door.

Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Hi.

Megan nods. Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		I've come to a decision.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Oh.

Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Let me just ask you
		something okay? And you can
		be totally honest. I'm
		prepared for any answer. It
		won't affect me...

David nods, "yes."

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Have you been with anyone?
		Since we started having
		problems? The answer won't
		affect me.

Beat. David stares at his wife.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		It won't affect me either
		way.

Beat. David doesn't say anything. He just nods, "No."

Megan's face starts to tremble. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very
affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		...My decision is... I'd
		like to start again. Pretend
		we're at the beginning.
			(beat)
		It's a big deal you walked
		away from that train. It's
		a second chance.
			(beat)
		If you want to ask me out
		sometime, that would be
		okay.

Megan nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her
disappear into the shadows.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERAN'S STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Sunday afternoon. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky.
The Philadelphia Eagles pro football players are in uniform and doing stretches
on the field. The opposing team warms up on the other end of the field.

The sixty thousand seats are already half filled as fans stream in on every level
of the stadium.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are
ripping tickets.

David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards.

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles
paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he
tilts his head sideways. "We sleep with quarterbacks," is written in block
letters.

David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is
wearing an eagles uniform.

The WALKIE TALKIE on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip an
listens.

				 WALKIE
		Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got
		a guy at gate 17C with a
		bogus ticket. Says he knows
		you. He won't tell me his
		name.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		What's he look like?

				 WALKIE
		He's got the most beautiful
		eyes... The hell kind of
		question is that? He's a
		guy.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Send him packing. I'm not
		walking all the way over
		there.

				 WALKIE
		Consider him packed. I
		didn't like his attitude...
		Struttin around with a cane
		and shit.

Beat.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Hold up Jenkins...

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 17C - AFTERNOON

David finds Elijah waiting to the side as the crowds funnel through the gate.
Elijah offers his hand as he walks up. David doesn't take it.

				 ELIJAH
		They said I couldn't get in
		with my ticket.

Elijah offers him the ticket. David inspects it.

				 DAVID
		It's for last week's game.

				 ELIJAH
		I've come to understand
		that...
			(beat)
		An ill advised purchase in
		the parking lot.

David hands Elijah back the ticket.

				 DAVID
		What do you want?

				 ELIJAH
		Not money.
			(beat)
		But I appreciate your
		healthy cynicism in the
		manner. It will be wise for
		both of us to proceed with
		greatest caution.

				 DAVID
		We're not proceeding
		anywhere together.

				 ELIJAH
		We've already begun.

David looks around.

				 DAVID
		One more time. What is it
		you want?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Why is it, do you think,
		that of all the professions
		in the world... you chose
		protection?

				 DAVID
		Are you for real?

				 ELIJAH
		You could have poured coffee
		in Starbucks, you could have
		learned to install track
		lighting in office
		buildings, you could have
		told people their horoscopes
		on the internet... You could
		have been one of ten
		thousand things... but in
		the end, you chose to
		protect people. You made
		that decision... and I find
		that very, very interesting.
			(beat)
		Now all I need is your
		credit card number.

Beat. Elijah smiles.

				 ELIJAH
		That last part was a joke.

David fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I got this job because my
		college coach called the guy
		who manages the stadium.
		There's no hidden meaning to
		it.

David's walkie makes NOIES on his hip.

				 DAVID
		They need me at the gate.

David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick.

				 DAVID
		Did you really want to see
		the game? I can get you in.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity.

David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		It gets heaviest ten minutes
		before kickoff.

David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and
continues walking.

David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		Why don't we pat down?

David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to
him.

				 DAVID
		Just give me a minute.

				 ELIJAH
		Is there a problem?

				 DAVID
		That guy in green. Sometimes
		people carry weapons in
		here. Then they drink too
		much. They're team isn't
		doing so well, bad things
		happen... We do random pat
		downs of the crowd to
		discourage people from
		carrying.
			(beat)
		If he's carrying, he'll step
		out of line.

Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through
the turnstiles.

The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he
watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile.

David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten...

The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket
melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the
stadium.

								  CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in
causing long shadows.

Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself.

THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE
FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL.

David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket.

				 DAVID
		I got you a seat in the
		seven hundred level.
			(points straight up)
		It's nose-bleed territory,
		but at least you won't get
		spit on.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you know that man
		you bumped was carrying a
		weapon?

				 DAVID
		Probably the army jacket.
		Those guys carry hunting
		knives and stuff for show.

				 ELIJAH
		You thought he was carrying
		a knife?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I thought he was carrying
		something.

				 ELIJAH
		But not a knife?

				 DAVID
		I got this picture of a
		silver handled gun tucked in
		his pants.
			(beat)
		Like on t.v.

Elijah stares at David. THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS.

				 ELIJAH
		You have good instincts when
		it comes to things like
		that?

				 DAVID
		Like what?

				 ELIJAH
		Telling when people have
		done something wrong?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

				 ELIJAH
		Have you ever tried to
		develop it?

				 DAVID
		I don't know what you're
		asking?

				 ELIJAH
		You're skill.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Listen. I got to be on the
		sidelines during the game...
		You can get to your seat by
		taking the stairwell at-

				 ELIJAH
		Characters in comic books
		are often attributed special
		powers. X-ray vision, things
		of that sort.

David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		Okay, I don't want to play
		this game anymore.

				 ELIJAH
		It's an exaggeration of the
		truth. Maybe it's based on
		something as simple as
		instinct. Like being able to
		touch someone and tell
		whether they've done
		something wrong... Or the
		level of what they've done
		wrong.

				 DAVID
		The guy might not have been
		carrying anything.

				 ELIJAH
		Or he might have been
		carrying a silver handled
		gun tucked in his pants.

David's WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE.

				 DAVID
		I have to go now.

				 ELIJAH
		One last question.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Quick.

				 ELIJAH
		The car accident you were
		in... Was there anyone else
		involved?

The two men stand very still in the tunnel.

				 DAVID
		Yes. My wife Megan. She was
		in the car with me.

David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Have a good life Elijah and
		try to buy your tickets at
		an authorized sales
		location.

Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of
the tunnel.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin
foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every
corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of
his car in the parking lot of the stadium. He sits as thoughts crash at his head.
Beat.

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview
mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car.

Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out
of the parking lot.

Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Elijah's walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking lot.

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step.

Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the
hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his
pace through the lot.

He gains on the army jacket.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		Hold up for a second!

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the
end of the parking lot. He looks back at Elijah for a beat. Doesn't like what he
sees. He disappears into the subway entrance.

Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful.
He makes it with great strain to the subway.

He looks into the entrance...

A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket
is glimpsed before it disappears.

Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		I just want to ask you
		something!

Elijah's VOICE ECHOES down the stairs. No response.

Elijah starts his descent.

THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.

Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's
moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.

His hand slips away from the railing...

He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is
heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.

The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL
STAIRS.

He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway
landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF
THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.

His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The
green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing
through the turnstile.

The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat
riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out
from the belt of his pants.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK

David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus
pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his
security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE.

David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are
having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to
David.

				 JEREMY
		Was it sold out?

David nods, "No."

				 DAVID
		You know how mad your mom
		would be if she knew you
		were playing football?

Jeremy nods.

				 JEREMY
		Are you going to tell?

David nods, "No."

				 JEREMY
		You want yo play the last
		downs? We got a big guy like
		you. You can play on
		opposite sides.

David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who
stands with the other children.

				 JEREMY
		He's Potter's cousin. He's
		the starting corner back for
		Temple University.

David stares at his son.

				 JEREMY
		He going pro in the draft.
		They say he can run the
		fifty-

				 DAVID
		In under six seconds.
			(beat)
		I've heard.

David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of
the kids feel his flexed bicep.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to go in.

				 JEREMY
		Just play one set of downs.
		I told them you were great.

				 DAVID
		Why'd you do that?

				 JEREMY
		Just one-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy.
			(beat)
		I'm going in. I have to do
		some things.

				 JEREMY
		What things?

				 DAVID
		I'm going to work out.

				 JEREMY
		I'll help you.

				 DAVID
		There's nothing to do.

Jeremy turns back to the children and waves.

				 JEREMY(yells)
		I can't play! I'm working
		out with my dad!

Jeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand. David looks down at his son
who waits patiently.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old
bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner.

David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and
places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you rest now? I'll
		take it from here. You've
		been a big help.

Jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could beat up
		Mike Tyson? I mean before he
		started wiggin out and
		eating people's ears?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you worked out
		everyday for six months? You
		think you could beat him
		then?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you only ate foods
		that were good for you and
		you worked out everyday for
		a year?

Jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on the barbell and comes
around to David's end of the bench. David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the barbell. Beat. He takes a deep breath.

The weight comes off the armrests of the bench. David lowers it to his chest and
pushes it back up. He does just one more rep with serious strain. He puts the
weight back on the armrest and sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you put on
		there?

David twists around and looks back at the barbell. He counts up the black metal
circles. He turns back to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		You put too much. That's two
		hundred and fifty pounds.

				 JEREMY
		How much can you lift?

David looks back at the weights.

				 DAVID
		That's the most I've ever
		lifted.
			(beat)
		That could have been
		dangerous Jeremy. Why don't
		you go upstairs and let me
		finish up?

Jeremy starts back to the barbell.

				 JEREMY
		I'll take it off. I'll help
		you right.

He slips off the safety collar.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could have
		beaten up Bruce Lee?

David hears the SOUND OF THE WEIGHTS SLIDING OFF THE BAR BEHIND HIM.

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		I mean if you knew karate?

				 DAVID
		No Jeremy.

				 JEREMY
		What if he wasn't aloud to
		kick and you were really mad
		at him?

Jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around
to David.

David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the bar. Lifts it off the armrest. Brings it down. His arms
are straining hard again. He raises it and lowers it two time; it takes a sizable
effort. The weights bang down onto the armrest.

David sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you take off?

				 JEREMY
		I lied.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		You added?

Jeremy nods, "Yes" slowly.

David turns completely around and looks at the barbell. He counts the black discs
on the steel bar. Beat.

Nobody says anything for a long time.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

				 DAVID(soft)
		Two hundred and seventy.

David just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar. Jeremy comes and
sits on the bench next to his father. They both stare at the weight. Beat.

				 JEREMY(dead serious)
		Let's put more.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

David's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar. He leans his head forward
and looks to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you move back a
		bit? Just to be safe.

Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits.

Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm
rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin
to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely
onto the rest.

David sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat.

				 JEREMY
		More?

Beat. David nods, "Yes."

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

An enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar. David's hands are gripping the
metal.

He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without
looking at him.

				 DAVID
		You should never try
		anything like this. You know
		that right?

Jeremy nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID
		What do you do if something
		happens?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		Get mom.

David nods, "yes" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath.
CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His
face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up
again two times before dropping it onto the armrest.

He slowly sits up.

				 DAVID
		How many did you put on that
		time?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		All of it.

				 DAVID
		There's no more left?

Jeremy nods, "no" in a slight daze. Beat. David looks around his basement.

				 DAVID
		What else can we use?

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal
handles on the outside of each side of the weights.

The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms
are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It
touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales
powerfully as he straightens his arms.

The bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as
they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat.

David sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the
discs and the cans.

His lips stop moving. Beat.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

David doesn't react.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it dad?

It takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		About three hundred and
		forty.

David turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at
his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

David sits on the edge of the bathroom tub. He's just showered and wearing jeans
and a t-shirt. He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the
white tiles of the floor.

THE PHONE RINGS.

David gets up and walks out of the bathroom. He picks up the phone and stands in
the bathroom doorway.

				 DAVID
		Yeah, hello.

				 WOMAN(on phone)
		Is David Dunne there?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		Yes. Is this David?

				 DAVID
		Yeah? Megan where are you
		calling from?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		My name is Megan Inverso. We
		went to college together.

David looks at the phone. The lights for line ONE and line TWO are glowing RED.
David squints his eyes as he pieces together the situation. Beat.

He moves back into the bathroom. The cord stretches as he takes his seat on the
edge of the bathtub.

				 DAVID
		I remember you.

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		I was hoping you would call
		me, but... Anyway I decided
		not to wait.
			(beat)
		I was thinking, it might be
		nice to go to dinner
		together.

Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		...Hello?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yeah it might be nice.

We hear A SOUND ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. A SOUND MUCH LIKE AN EXHALE.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATE EVENING

The local Chinese restaurant. Red and gold plastic dragons hang from the ceiling.
A couple late-nighters are at the bar. Megan and David are two of a handful of
people left dining in the restaurant. They're a little dressed up. Megan looks
kind of stunning.

				 DAVID
		...When you work with
		clients on machines, do they
		sometimes just jump up a
		level or two? Do something
		they didn't know they were
		capable of?

				 MEGAN
		Not often, but it is
		possible. Most people get
		scared when they see the
		shadow of their limits. They
		don't know how long the
		shadow really is. They don't
		know how far away the real
		limits are standing... They
		stop out of fear.

David nods as he takes it in. Beat. He looks down at his plate and twirls his lo
mein onto a fork. Megan watches him.

				 MEGAN
		This is kind of strange
		isn't it?

David nods, "yes" before taking the bite.

				 MEGAN
		We're not even acting like
		ourselves.

David touches his mouth with his napkin.

				 MEGAN
		Like that. Your mouth's
		dirty. You tapped your
		napkin to your lips. You
		only do that when you're
		with someone you don't know.

David looks down at his napkin.

				 DAVID
		What do I do when I'm around
		someone I know?

				 MEGAN
		You use your sleeve.

They both smile at each other. Beat.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		Megan?

David and Megan look over to the only other table of late night diners as they
get up from their table. A woman about Megan's age walks over to her.

				 WOMAN
		I thought it was you.

				 MEGAN
		Hi.
			 (to David)
		This is Claire. Her son is
		in Jeremy's class. Claire
		and I worked on the school
		food drive together.

				 DAVID
		Hello.

CLAIRE smiles as she stares at David. She turns to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(mouths)
		He's cute.

Claire turns back to David.

				 CLAIRE
		I'm very happy about this.
		Megan mentioned to me she
		was considering dating
		again.

Megan becomes still.

				 CLAIRE(to David)
		I'm sorry, what's your name?

Beat. David doesn't look up.

				 DAVID
		David.

				 CLAIRE
		David?

				 MEGAN
		This is my husband.

Beat. All three people become frozen in silence.

Claire looks to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(soft)
		I am so sorry.

Megan nods.

Claire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the
restaurant. Beat.

Megan and David are the last one's left. They sit silently in their booth. Megan
looks at David's face. He's shaken.

He slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

It's late. NO LIGHTS ARE ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE HALL. The babysitter has black
dyes hair and Buddy Holly glasses. David waits as she puts on her jacket.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		He ate about six of those
		chocolate covered doughnut
		holes with his milk. He said
		he only had three, but I
		know he had six.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

David is not paying attention to the girl. He watches as his wife takes off her
coat and heads to the guest room. She turns before entering the room. David and
his wife make eye contact.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		Goodnight.

David nods. Megan goes into her room. The guest door closes softly.

David finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		My parents sleep in separate
		beds.

David reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money.

				 DAVID
		Thank you.

David opens the front door for her.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		By the way, Jeremy went to
		sleep in his room tonight.

				 DAVID
		His room?

The baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM

David walks into the darkened child's bedroom. The lump on the bed turns when he
hears movement. He smiles when he sees David.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I'm sleeping in my room.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I see.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I'm not scared.

				 DAVID(soft)
		That's great.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		Do you know why?

David nods, "No."

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I know now.

				 DAVID(soft)
		Know what?

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		You're secret identity.
			(beat)
		That man was right.

Beat. David just stares at his son. Jeremy's eyes start to close.

				 DAVID
		Jeremy.

Jeremy opens his eyes.

				 DAVID(soft)
		There are big guys in almost
		every gym who can lift that
		much.

Beat. Jeremy's eyes start to shut.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		You could have lifted more.
			 (his eyes close)
		...Don't worry, I won't tell
		anyone.

Jeremy Dunne falls asleep. David Dunne stands in the darkness of his son's room.
Posters of comic book heroes don the walls around him.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Elijah's cheek rests against two pristine white pillows. He looks exhausted. His
eyes are fixed on some abstract point in the room. WE HEAR SOUNDS OF A HOSPITAL.

The torso of a PHYSICIAN can be seen on the other side of the bed. We hear him
speak but never see his face.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		...fracture of the proximal
		phalanx of the little finger
		as well as multiple
		fractures of the sixth,
		seventh, and eighth ribs.
		The worst of the injury,

				 ELIJAH
		They call me Mr. Glass.

Beat.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Who does?

				 ELIJAH
		Kids.

Elijah just keeps staring.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Shall I continue?

Beat. Elijah's head nods the slightest bit up and down.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Pins were placed throughout
		the length of the leg. The
		use of a wheelchair will be
		needed for a two month
		period. The use of crutches

The PHYSICIAN'S WORDS FADE AWAY as Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point
in the room.

								FADE TO BLACK:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE MORNING

WE EMERGE FROM DARKNESS TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER.

A CO-WORKER finds Megan working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a
stationary bike.

				 JANIS
		Your ten o'clock is here.
		The hospital discharged him
		this morning.

				 MEGAN
		Thanks.

The co-worker takes Megan's position by the elderly man.

Megan crosses the physical therapy center. A man in a wheel chair waits by her
office. She walks up to him with a smile.

				 MEGAN
		Elijah right?

Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight. Under his shirt
we see the wrappings around his ribs. His left pinky is in a splint. He smiles
and nods, "yes" to Megan.

								  CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

David Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into
the players locker room.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room
has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment.

About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost
in their own pre-game rituals.

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and
removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down,
wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.

He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of
the large room not occupied by anyone.

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of
free weights sit behind the press.

David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either
side. Six in all.

David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing.
Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the
players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell
phones...

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off
the weight rack.

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...

And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.

David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.

He closes his eyes...

David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.

His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps
training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.

And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.

The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His
arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.

He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the
smallest of CLINKS.

David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs.

				 DAVID(whispers)
		Four ten... four
		forty-five...
			(beat)
		Five hundred.

Beat. David sits up in a daze.

He finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. Some of the
players have stood up. Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet
disbelief in their eyes.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON

Megan and Elijah are in the far corner of the room. They're separated from the
other clients. Megan is seated on an exercise machine. Elijah is in his wheel
chair facing her.

				 MEGAN
		We're going to prevent any
		substantial atrophy of your
		good leg with this.
			(She taps the machine)
		It works the quadriceps.

				 ELIJAH
		How long have you been
		married?

Megan is taken off guard by the question. She stares at Elijah. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Twelve years.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you get together?

Elijah smiles warmly. Megan smiles softly back.

				 MEGAN
		A car accident.

Elijah smiles even bigger.

				 ELIJAH
		Now you're going to have to
		tell me more.

				 MEGAN
		...See my husband was a big
		football star in college and
		we were in an accident
		together. Our car flipped on
		an icy road. We were both
		injured. He couldn't play
		football anymore.
			(beat)
		If that hadn't happened, we
		wouldn't have been together.

				 ELIJAH
		How so?

				 MEGAN
		Football wasn't the kind of
		life I wanted... For ten
		years I'd be by the phone
		waiting for a call telling
		me he broke his neck in a
		practice game. And if it
		wasn't that call, it would
		be a call telling me he blew
		out his knee or suffered his
		third concussion. I've seen
		way too much of it in my
		job... I can barely take it
		when my clients are in pain.
			(beat)
		I don't hate the game. I
		admire the amount of skill
		it involved and, like
		everyone else, I was in awe
		of how he could play it, but
		I couldn't give him my heart
		and then have something
		happen to him. And it always
		does with that game.
			(beat)
		It's not a thing many people
		would understand.

				 ELIJAH
		You and my mother would have
		a special connection.

				 MEGAN
		Any way, fate stepped in and
		took football out of the
		equation.

				 ELIJAH
		...And everyone lived
		happily ever after.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Sort of.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		What part of David's body
		was injured?

Beat. Megan's eyes become utterly still.

				 MEGAN
		Who said my husband's name

INT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Eleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue
and gray on the field. A sold out stadium watches the event.

David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the
second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the
bathrooms and concession stands and back again.

David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against
the wall. He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the
tunnel.

Beat. His shoulder leaves the wall. He STEPS OUT into the stream of people.
Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move.

David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening.

He continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the
movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass.

And then it happens... A stocky woman bumps into him.

FLASH CUT: AN IMAGE OF THE STOCKY WOMAN IN A BATHROBE STANDING IN A KITCHEN.
SHE'S HOLDING THE SHOULDER OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY STANDING NEXT TO HER. HE'S
CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY.

THEY BOTH ARE LOOKING DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WHERE THREE THINGS ARE LAID
OUT... A BELT, A HANGER, AND AN EXTENSION CORD.

				 STOCKY WOMAN
		Choose.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

We're back with David in the crowd. He turns and watches the stocky woman walk
down the tunnel. She's holding the wrist of her five year old son. She yanks it
quickly and violently to keep the boy close at her side. She and the boy dissolve
into the crowd.

				 MEGAN
		And what was that

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		It's a mediocre time Mrs.
		Dunne. People are starting

Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		Is this a religious thing?

				 ELIJAH
		I own a comic book museum.
		It's called the Limited

		For a second there I thought

The gray eyes man in the blue sweat shirt pauses with nachos in hand at the top

David walks the five feet between them and taps him on the shoulder. People
continue to stream by as the man turns to face David. The man's GRAY EYES go from
David's face to the security emblem on his shirt. The man's face becomes still.

				 GRAY EYED MAN
		Yeah?

David stares hard at the man in front of him.

				 DAVID
		We've had some problems with

		Would you mind if I checked

The gray eyed man stands eerily still with his nachos and drinks. The two men
just stare at each other, evaluating the situation. People move in both
directions around them, unaware.

The gray eyes man holds his tray of food to the side and raises his arms slowly.

David steps forward and reaches into his pockets. Beat. David pulls his hands out
from the pockets. They're empty.

The gray eyes man brings his arms down. Beat.

The walkie on David's hip COMES TO LIFE. David reaches down and pulls it off his
belt without removing his eyes from the man in front of him. David brings the
walkie to his mouth.

		gun?

Jeremy nods, "Yes." Crying harder now.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-You won't get hurt...

				 DAVID
		-Elijah was wrong.

				 MEGAN
		-Sometimes when people are
		sick or hurt for a long
		time, like Elijah, they're
		mind gets hurt too.

David shoots a tense glance at Megan.

				 MEGAN
		-They start to think things
		that aren't true. He hold me
		what he thought about your
		father. It isn't true.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-I'll show you.

David starts moving a little to his right. Jeremy follows him with the barrel of
the handgun. David stops moving.

				 DAVID
		-You know the story about
		the kid who almost drowned
		in the pool?

Jeremy stops moving.

				 DAVID
		-That was me they were
		talking about. I almost
		died. That was me.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-You're lying.

				 DAVID
		-I'm not. I just didn't
		connect it.

				 MEGAN
		-Jeremy, your father was
		injured in college - you
		know that. You know all
		about that.

Jeremy's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face.

				 MEGAN
		-Don't do it. He'll die
		Jeremy.

Beat. Jeremy looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-I'll just shoot him once.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy listen to what-

Jeremy starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back.

				 JEREMY
		-Don't be scared.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy if you pull that
		trigger I'm going to leave!
		I'm going to go to New York.

Jeremy freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Megan then back to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		You're right... If you shoot
		me, that bullet is going to
		bounce off me and I won't
		get hurt... but then I'm
		going to go upstairs and
		pack. And then leave to New
		York.

Beat.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-Why?

Jeremy's hands are trembling. He starts to close his eyes as he raises the gun
level with David's chest.

				 DAVID(loud)
		Jeremy!

Jeremy's eyes open.

				 DAVID(loud)
		You're about to get into big
		trouble! I'm your father and
		I'm telling you to put that
		gun down right now God damn
		it!
			(beat)
		One!...
			(beat)
		Two!...

Jeremy puts the gun down on the floor in front of him and stands up.

Megan leans against the refrigerator and slides down to a sitting position on the
tiled floor.

David walks over and picks up the gun. He unloads the bullets in his hand. David
bends down very slowly and takes a seat on the kitchen floor.

Jeremy is the last to sit down. He takes a seat in the doorway of the kitchen.
Beat. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. Beat.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		...You didn't have to yell.

The Dunne family sits in silence on the floor of their kitchen.

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON

People move up and down the streets outside the storefronts. David is one of
them. He waits to cross the street. He sees movement inside the Limited Edition
window.

								  CUT TO:

INT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON

Elijah opens the door. It takes him a bit, because of the wheelchair.

David stares at Elijah's damaged condition. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Joined a rugby league.
		Turned out to be a bad idea.
			(beat)
		Come here I want to show you
		something.

Elijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall. It's a charcoal
drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered.
A huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is
just out of frame.

				 ELIJAH
		Look at this. I just noticed
		this today.

David steps in close and studies the drawing.

				 ELIJAH
		This is from the Sentryman
		series. A color version of
		this was actually used in
		the second issue.

Elijah points up to the drawing's face.

				 ELIJAH
		Look at this eyes. What do
		you see?

David looks right at the intense eyes of the drawing.

				 ELIJAH
		It's fear.
			(beat)
		He was scared. They were
		being honest in the
		beginning you see. They let
		him be human.
			(beat)
		They turned him into a
		garden variety hero later...
		Then he was brave all the
		time.

Elijah turns to David.

				 ELIJAH
		I followed the guy in the
		army jacket.

David becomes still as his words register.

				 ELIJAH
		He had a silver handled gun
		tucked in the back of his
		pants.
			(beat)
		Were you really injured in
		that car accident in
		college?

David looks unsteady all of the sudden.

				 ELIJAH
		Because I think you faked
		it. I think you took the
		opportunity to end your
		career - no questions asked.
			(beat)
		And I think you did it, of
		all things, for a women...
			(beat)
		Not only do you have the
		physical traits of a hero,
		down somewhere in there, you
		have the moral code of one
		too. You were ready to
		sacrifice everything for
		what's right. Where can you
		find that these days?
			(beat)
		Only thing you didn't realize
		is that you were giving up
		a part of yourself when you
		gave up football. The
		physical part. And you need
		that part desperately to
		feel balance again...
			(beat)
		You can have it back now.
			(beat)
		This was all just make
		believe before. What if
		there was someone the
		opposite of me? What if?...
			(beat)
		I now believe you are the
		genuine article Mr. David
		Dunne. The kind of person we
		knew existed, from our
		history.

Elijah points to the room full of pictures.

				 ELIJAH
		It's time for someone like
		you.
			(beat)
		Bad is winning. I can feel
		it.

Elijah looks at David with deep admiration. His voice cracked a little at the end
of his words. Beat.

David doesn't take his hands out of his pockets.

				 DAVID(rattled)
		I must have felt some lump
		in his back when I bumped
		him. Most guns have a black
		or silver handle. I had a
		fifty-fifty shot at the
		color.

				 ELIJAH
		That's not what I witnessed
		David.

				 DAVID
		Stop messing with my life
		Elijah. My son almost shot
		me last night. He wanted to
		prove you were right.

				 ELIJAH
		I never said you couldn't be
		killed. I never said that.

				 DAVID
		You have a problem, Elijah.
		My wife is right. Somewhere
		along the line one of your
		bones broke and your mind
		just broke with it.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Are you finished?

				 DAVID
		No. And I have been sick. I
		spent a week in a hospital
		when I was a boy recovering
		from pneumonia and almost
		drowning.

				 DAVID
		Two skinny eight year old
		kids were playing around the
		pool. They were dunking me.
		I swallowed water. They
		didn't know it and they
		almost killed me.
			(beat)
		Heroes don't get killed like
		that. Normal people do.

Beat. Elijah seems shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly.

				 DAVID
		I don't want to see you
		again okay.
			(soft)
		Now I'm finished.

David turns and starts for the entrance. The BELL OF THE DOOR CLANGS as David
Dunne leaves the store.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

David exits the Limited Edition and moves down the street lost in this thoughts.
He bumps a man in a jacket and tie walking in the opposite direction.

FLASH CUT: THE SAME MAN STANDS IN A BAGGY SWEATER. AGAINST A PARKED CAR HE'S
HOLDING SOMETHING SHINY AND METALLIC IN HIS HANDS. HE INSERTS IT IN THE HALF INCH
GAP BETWEEN THE GLASS OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW AND THE DOOR. THE DOOR UNLOCKS.

THE MAN LOOKS AROUND QUIETLY BEFORE ENTERING THE CAR.

SLAM CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:

David looks over his shoulder at the conservative looking man in a shirt and tie
walking down the street.

David Dunne is shaken. He turns and keeps walking.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

A superhero action figure and a plastic villain do battle on Jeremy's desk.

David sits dressed up in a white shirt and dress pants. He holds the villain.
Jeremy holds the superhero.

Megan enters the room in a beautiful brown dress.

				 MEGAN
		The sitter's here.

David nods, "yes." Megan studies his tense expression.

				 MEGAN
		We can do this another time
		if you want? I'm fine with
		anything.

David looks from the action figures, to his son's face to the face of his wife.
They both have the same quiet anxious expression. Beat.

				 DAVID
		But I put cologne on.

Megan smiles.

				 MEGAN
		Is that what that smell is?

Jeremy giggles.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT

An overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. We
are in a low-end comic book store. The walls are lined with shelves of comic
books. The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case.

THE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one
head is visible behind a low rack.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hey man it's twenty after.
		It's time to close. I gotta
		head.

The top of the man's head doesn't move. Beat.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		You better not be jacking
		off to the Japanese comics.
		I swear to God.

No response. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back.

As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair.
The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Listen man, I didn't know
		you were in-
			(beat)
		Just choose something all
		right?

Elijah doesn't react. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans
over.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hello. You understand
		English?

Ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Look man, I'm just gonna
		wheel you out. You can think
		about things outside on the
		sidewalk. I gotta get some
		chicken in me, you know what
		I'm saying?

Beat. The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling
him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics.

Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left
leg hits a rack of comic books. A handful of comics tumbles to the ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Shit.

The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again.
After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the
wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and
fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Dude, I don't care if you
		are in a wheelchair. If you
		do that again, I'm calling
		Five-O.

Beat. The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, "Yes." He straightens the
chair.

They move down the aisle. All is quiet... and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to
the left again. His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. Elijah
gets covered in comics.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		That's it crackerjack!
		You're going to sit your ass
		in jail now.

The Ponytail man moves to the front counter.

Elijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over. His eyes stare at a comic book
in his lap. His expression changes for the first time.

The Ponytail man finishes dialing. He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a
voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		How much is this one?

								  CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

LATE EVENING. A trendy restaurant. Not enough light to read the menus.

David and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat. They sip their drinks as
they appear in deep thought.

				 DAVID
		...I think rust.

				 MEGAN
		Rust?

				 DAVID
		As a color, not as rust. You
		know, a rust colored paint
		or wood?

Megan leans slightly closer.

				 MEGAN
		I didn't know that. Mine's
		still brown.

				 DAVID
		My turn. What's your
		favorite song?

				 MEGAN
		Soft and Wet, by the Artist
		Formerly Known as Prince.

				 DAVID
		What was that?

				 MEGAN
		We're supposed to be honest.

Beat. David brings his stool closer.

				 DAVID
		Soft and Wet. That's very
		interesting.

				 MEGAN
		My turn.
			(beat)
		When was the first time the
		thought popped into your
		head that we might not make
		it?

David's grin slowly fades.

				 DAVID
		That's not the game.

Megan moves her stool closer. They're only a foot or so apart.

				 MEGAN
		It's a second date. There
		aren't any rules.

Beat. David sips his drink slowly.

				 DAVID
		I'm not sure.

				 MEGAN
		Think carefully?

				 DAVID
		What about the game?

				 MEGAN
		It's finished. I won.

Beat. David glances at Megan. She waits for his answer.

				 MEGAN
		Maybe it wasn't a specific
		moment, maybe it-

				 DAVID
		I had a nightmare one night
		and I didn't wake you up so
		you could tell me it was
		okay.
			(beat)
		I think that was the first
		time.
			(beat)
		Does that count?

				 MEGAN(soft)
		That counts.

Beat. Megan takes her glass up to her lips. Doesn't take a sip. Brings it back
down.

				 MEGAN
		Do you knowingly keep Jeremy
		and me at a distance?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

Megan's face tenses. She's on the verge of getting upset.

				 MEGAN
		Why?

				 DAVID
		I don't know Megan.

				 MEGAN
		It's like you resent us
		David. Resent the life you
		have.

Beat. David doesn't answer.

				 MEGAN
		You know even if it meant we
		couldn't be together, I
		would never have wished that
		injury on you? What you
		could so physically was a
		gift. I would never have
		wished it to go away.

Megan's eyes glaze with water. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		You know that right?

David takes a sip with a trembling hand. David's eyes look up and make eye
contact with Megan's. He stares at her for the longest time.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I know.

Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second
date.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Megan stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the
black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		You got two calls. One came
		through while I was on the
		line - I wasn't talking too
		long. There was an emergency
		with my sister. She tried to
		do her own perm and now she
		looks like-

				 DAVID
		Who called through?

Megan tries to hide her smile.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Someone from New York.

The smile instantly fades.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		About a security job at a
		museum. They want to hire
		you.
			(beat)
		I didn't know you guys were
		moving to New York. Thanks
		for telling me.

				 MEGAN
		We're not moving.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Oh.
			(beat)
		I let the answering machine
		pick up the other call.

The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly
quiet faces.

David hands her the money. She opens the door. It's started to rain.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Great.

The babysitter covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway. David
closes the door. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Look let's be honest here.
		We're just at the beginning.
		I don't expect you or I to
		change the course of where
		our lives were headed
		because of two dates.
			(beat)
		If you do go to New York, we
		can still develop this.
		We'll just be forced to take
		it slow. And in the end,
		that's definitely better.
			(beat)
		This is our second time
		around David. I don't expect
		us to get carried away.
			(beat)
		I guess congratulations is
		the right thing to say.

Megan takes off her coat as she moves to the guest bedroom. She disappears
inside. The door closely behind her.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Only the COUNTER LIGHT is on in the kitchen. David stands by the phone.

ELIJAH'S VOICE IS HEARD ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

				 ELIJAH(on tape)
		...David. It's Elijah. It
		was so obvious. It's
		referred to over and over.
		That's the key you see. The
		repetition across time. That
		means at some point it was
		all based on common thought,
		a common event - a fact.
			(beat)
		It was this one issue that
		brought it back for me...
		Century Comics
		One-Seventeen. That's where
		this group, the Coalition of
		Evil, tried to ascertain the
		weakness of every superhero.

				 ELIJAH(on tape)
		...Because they all have
		one.
			(beat)
		Just like you.
			(beat)
		The cells that make up your
		muscles and your bones react
		to forces that act upon it,
		slightly different from than
		mine. That's clear... Your
		cells react to bacteria and
		viruses slightly differently
		than mine... That's also
		clear...But for some reason,
		you and I react the exact
		same way to water. We
		swallow it, we choke. We
		swallow too much of it, we
		drown. However unreal it may
		seem, we are connected, you
		and I, we are on the same
		curve... just on opposite
		ends.

				 ELIJAH
		The point of all this is, we
		now know something we
		didn't... You have a
		weakness... Water. It's your
		krpytonite.
			(beat)
		You hearing me David? Call
		me back... I got rugby
		practice in an hour.

THE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS
OFF.

David hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before
ANNOUNCING.

				 MACHINE
		Message erased.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two
identical sinks sit opposite each other.

David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze
staring at the tiled floor.

His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of
the sinks.

David rises and picks it up.

It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit
on its edge.

David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he
hesitates.

His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A
CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS...
COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT...

David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own
identical mirrored medicine cabinet.

There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND
COLOGNE.

David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT.

David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt.

He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word
"security" is almost faded away.

He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT

Rain falls like gunfire from the sky.

David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot.

David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT

A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of
interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate
with a lock stops his progress.

David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a
construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area
next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station
grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can
only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away
from the immaculately lit train station.

Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the
fence door that holds him back from going down.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the
body of the caved-in passenger car.

The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line,
the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows
exposing the ravaged interior.

David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the
wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face.

His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow
breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE.

								  CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: EXT. STREET - NIGHT

SILENCE. BLACK. OUR VISION CLEARS TO REVEAL the glazed icy top of a street.

THE SOUND OF DISTANT FIRE COMES INTO THE SILENCE.

A TWENTY YEAR OLD DAVID DUNNE rises to his feet from the ground where he was
laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield. He looks down at himself. His
football jacket is torn. So are his jeans... He's trembling slightly, but not
bleeding.

HE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE NOISES.

About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole.
It's front is on fire.

Through one of the crushed door windows, WE SEE A WOMAN'S HAND.

Young David heads toward his car. He slips a couple of times on the slick iced
surface of the road.

He kneels down next to the inverted car. He looks in the crushed window frame.

THE FACE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD MEGAN IS UPSIDE DOWN. She is unconscious.

				 DAVID
		Megan...

She doesn't answer. Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel.

David pulls at the handle of the mangled door. It's wedged tight. It won't move.

The heat from the fire is tremendous.

David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength.

WE HEAR THE CREAK OF METAL... THE DOOR BENDS UNNATURALLY AND THEN PRACTICALLY
RIPS OPEN.

David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the
steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding.

David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road. He lays her
down gently.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

He just stares at her. She doesn't respond.

A LIGHT WASHES OVER THEM. David turns to see a truck approaching up the road.
David waves frantically. The truck slows.

David turns back to Megan. Her eyes are open.

Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes. She looks at
David.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		I thought I was dead.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Me too.

The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David.

				 DRIVER
		Is she all right?

				 DAVID
		I think her leg is
		fractured.

				 DRIVER
		Are you injured?

Beat. David looks at Megan who lays shivering in the grass. He looks back at the
driver.

				 DAVID(soft)
		My shoulder's hurt.

The driver nods.

				 DRIVER
		Hold on. I got a C.B. in the
		truck.

The driver moves back to his truck.

David takes Megan's hand in his and waits in the grass by the sight of their car
on fire.

PRESENT: EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

David stands utterly still in the graveyard of train 177.

								  CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the SOUND OF
THE PHONE RINGING.

He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There
are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat
piles.

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath.

				 ELIJAH
		Hello.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		David?

Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN
OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		What am I supposed to do?

Elijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a
football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a
misty hand painted ceiling.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		David, it's okay to be
		afraid. Because this part
		won't be like a comic
		book... Real life doesn't
		fit into little boxes that
		were drawn for it.

David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and
departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic
throughout the station.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		Go to where people are...
		You won't have to look very
		long.

David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them.

He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It
watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier
to heaven.

David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving
passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as
they move.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES
STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE.

SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS
COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards
the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving.

David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information
board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady
spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side.

David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines
of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either
side of him.

David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side.
His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by.

Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt
and slicked back hair brushes by...

FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S
HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER.

				 SLICKED HAIR MAN
		Go back to Africa!

THE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY
WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the
information booth. He watches him for a beat.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A
GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS.

				 TEENAGER
		What's your name? I think
		you drank too much.

THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP
HER THIGH.

THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING
BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and
greets a group of identically dressed friends.

Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep
breaths as he gathers himself.

Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing
behind him.

David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus.

FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR.
HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW
FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Can I come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		Who are you?

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		I like your house. Can I
		come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What is this?
			(beat)
		No you can't come in.

Beat.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Are you sure?

The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it.
The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him.

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What are you doing?

The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening...
It opens slowly anyway.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable.

David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing
shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and
then finally onto the man.

He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive.
He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM.

The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the
full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full
trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.

David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station
Maintenance Staff Only".

Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his
bin inside.

David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the
longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the
doors.

And then they open.

The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's
wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit.

David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city
block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at
this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet
behind.

The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The
uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves.

He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail
out of the mailbox.

David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He
stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks
over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled
house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.

								  CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps
into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or
three days worth.

David shuts the door very slowly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE
KITCHEN.

David stares out from under his hood at the mess.

Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of
unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits
frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of
colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.

David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets
closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open
quietly.

A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom
of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the
flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies
folded over itself on his still chest.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in
a pyramid on the coffee table.

David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense.

THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and
follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM.

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are
everywhere. The room is empty.

A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists
with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms
pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest.

Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and
seated in the same way.

Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes
half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded
figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping
water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them.

They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them.
They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them.
They boy blinks once slowly.

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.

				 DAVID
		You need to leave now.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes
hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on
top of it.

David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the
other side of the bedroom.

A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped
against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable
bruises on her face and arms.

David stands before her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		Where is he?

The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The
curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside.

David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony.
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it.

David steps onto the balcony and looks down.

The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers
a pool in the backyard.

David turns to go back inside.

A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.

The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into
David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing.

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly
towards the black tarp.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. POOL - NIGHT

David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp.

There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his
cheek. Half his face is covered in water.

Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets
pounded by the rain.

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water
as his pressure pushes the tarp down.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START.

David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.

The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.

One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the
edge of the pool.

And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the
tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.

								  CUT TO:

EXT.  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

David's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the
constricting black tarp. He's drowning.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED
IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.

The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place
around the edge of the pool.

The rain keeps falling.

The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with
every movement.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN. TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR
THE EDGE OF THE POOL. FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEY'RE HOLDING... A ROD OR
POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE.

David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.

The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the
pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the
pool's edge.

Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of
the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.

He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain
poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat.

He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing,
calming.

He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the
two small figures standing near the edge of the pool.

The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an
aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the
hooded figure.

No one says anything.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door
handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he
looks down at her.

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move
closer. Right behind him.

The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching
over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.

David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp
together like and iron vise. He squeezes.

The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.

David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back
violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard
stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.

The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.
David's arm remains locked around his throat.

The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.
He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The
room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.

And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in
David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate
blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.

The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.

David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his
tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE
APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.

David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just
dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the
carpet now.

David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the
man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.

David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw.
The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE
ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.

He moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone
cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		It's over now.
			(beat)
		Your children are fine.
		They're getting help.

He unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I'm going to go now.

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally
still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run
down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath
against his hand. Beat.

He rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom
of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position
against her bathroom door.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

The front door opens to SILENCE. The silhouetted figure of David steps into the
darkness of his home.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

The dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet
next to the family winter coats.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares
down at the shadowy figure of his son.

He pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room.

He doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to
disappear into the shadows of the room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Megan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow.

Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR.

She starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees
David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her.
No words are spoken.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT

They enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed.

She watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her.

He covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I had a bad dream.

David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes.

Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		It's over now.

She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

Downtown Philadelphia.

People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is
among them.

He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the
store are open.

A banner over the door reads, "Annual Sale."

								  CUT TO:

INT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY

The compact store is crowded with customers.

David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic
hero.

David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at
a framed sketch.

Beat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David.

				 WOMAN
		...See the villain's eyes.
		They're larger than the
		other characters'. They
		insinuate a slightly skewed
		perspective of how they see
		the world. Just off normal.

David stares at the drawing.

				 DAVID
		He doesn't look very
		threatening.

				 WOMAN
		That's what I said to my
		son. He said, there's always
		two kinds. The soldier
		villain who fights the hero
		with his hands, and then
		there's the real threat. The
		brilliant and evil arch
		enemy who fights the hero
		with his mind.

David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her
sixties who stands next to him.

				 DAVID
		Are you Elijah's mother?

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I am. I'm helping him with
		the sale.

				 DAVID
		It's a pleasure to meet you.
		I'm David Dunne.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		He's spoken of you. He says
		you're becoming friends.

				 DAVID
		We are.

David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers.

				 DAVID
		He's doing well today.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'm very proud of him.
			(beat)
		He's been through a lot in
		his life. A lot of ups and
		downs, a lot of bad spells.
		A couple I'd thought had
		broken him... I mean
		emotionally.
			(beat)
		They were bad... But he made
		it. Yes he did.

				 DAVID
		He's kind of a miracle.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Yes he is.

They both watch Elijah from across the room.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'll tell him you're here.

David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to
finish talking.

David turns back to the framed sketch. He looks at it with his hands in his
pockets. Beat.

David's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.

THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows.
He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the
machine. The machine has wheels.

David turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his
wheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes
negotiating.

David turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more
you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a
wheelchair.

David looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has
spotted David.

Beat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.

				 ELIJAH
		Did you see this?

Elijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.

There's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled
children behind him.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		It has begun.

David stares quietly at the sketch of himself.

				 ELIJAH
		When I saw it this morning.
		I felt a part of the world
		again.

Elijah looks down at the newspaper.

David hesitates and then reaches forward.

He reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.

FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE
AIRFIELD. HE'S CRYING.

SIRENS START SOUNDING THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT.

WAITING PASSENGERS START GETTING UP AND MOVING TO THE WINDOWS.

				 MAN
		What's going on?

Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured
eyes.

				 ELIJAH
		A plane just crashed.

								  CUT TO:

FLASH CUT: ELIJAH AND AN ELDERLY MAN IN A UNIFORM ARE SEATED IN A HOTEL BAR.

				 ELDERLY MAN
		I've worked here twenty-five
		years. I know all its
		secrets.

				 ELIJAH
		Secrets?

				 ELDERLY MAN(whispers)
		Like if there was ever a
		fire on floors one, two, or
		three... Everyone in this
		hotel would be burned alive.

ELIJAH LOOKS UP FROM HIS DRINK.

								  CUT TO:

FLASHCUT: ELIJAH LEAVES THE ENGINEERING ROOM OF AN AMTRAK TRAIN. HE PASSES THE
ENGINEER WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED WITH COFFEE.

				 ENGINEER
		Passengers aren't allowed in
		there.

Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David takes two unsteady steps back. Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes
down at the newspaper. He looks up to David.

				 ELIJAH(low voice)
		I almost gave up hope. There
		were so many times I
		questioned myself. I've made
		so many sacrifices but it's
		all been worth it.
			(beat)
		There are millions and
		millions or mediocre people
		in the world David. Isn't it
		great that we aren't one of
		them?

David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store.

Customers step between him and Elijah. Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked
from view.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

David emerges from the store slowly. He braces himself against a parked car and
then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze.

WE PULL BACK as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people,
walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city.

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING

          CLOSE ON: A "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises
          past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.
          We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE
          worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his
          physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome
          too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.
          Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian
          tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific
          New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He
          sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits
          the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news:

          ANCHORWOMAN
          --addressing the United Nations today,
          the President expressed his concern over
          the increasingly intense territorial
          disputes in both Asia and the Middle
          East.
          CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--

          PRESIDENT
          The sound of a bullet at one end of the
          world echoes across the ocean to the
          other end. Armed conflict is not self
          contained in its respective region--the
          consequences reverberate through every
          nation across the world and therefore
          must be avoided at all costs.
          CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--

          ANCHORWOMAN
          While the President's position was clear,
          he did not comment on whether or not he
          would order Dr. Manhattan into action
          should the situation continue to
          escalate.
          CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he
          appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage
          shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads
          straight for him.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          2.

          CONTINUED:
          With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in
          its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face.
          With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr.
          Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the
          smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed--
          --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel--
          CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake
          jumps up, immediately at the ready--
          --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake
          sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see
          that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT
          HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.

          BLAKE
          Just a matter of time, I suppose.
          With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from
          under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The
          Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes,
          but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER
          from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro
          . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot
          off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out
          of Blake's hand--
          --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder
          drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like
          the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much
          faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to
          the head.
          Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake
          up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great
          New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in
          the eye
          . and starts laughing. Hysterical.

          BLAKE (CONT'D)
          I always thought I knew the punchline.
          But I guess the joke's on me now.
          He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment--
          --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS
          HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a
          sound as he plummets to the sidewalk.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          EXT. STREET - EVENING

          CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in
          fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his
          head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the
          sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood
          DRIPS on it
          . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.

          EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT)

          A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from
          the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its
          place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.

          COP 1
          Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!

          SHOPKEEPER
          It's been over four hours, I got a
          business to run--
          As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as
          the water carries it to a DRAIN--
          --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV
          as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.
          We never see his face. We move from his POV--
          --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at
          the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still
          arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow
          tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.
          Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse
          the magazines and periodicals, most of which have
          inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere
          currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads "War?", The
          New York Times: "China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese
          Waters," The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President
          with Dr. Manhattan: "What Me Worry?"
          The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.

          NEWS VENDOR

          I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late--
          We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment
          building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass
          window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          --inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded)
          and DET. FINE (street worn, but not quite cynical yet) walk
          through the crime scene. Fine studies the broken window.

          DET. FINE
          Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225.
          A solid 225, guy was built like a
          linebacker. This is plate glass too,
          you'd have to step on the gas just to put
          a crack in this. Had to be a two man job.
          At least. You check the bedroom?

          DET. GALLAGHER
          Drawers were open, tossed through.
          Mattress flipped.

          DET. FINE
          Robbery?

          DET. GALLAGHER
          Or made to look like one.
          (tosses Fine an ID)
          Found that in the bedroom.
          Det. Fine studies it. It's Blake's UNITED NATIONS ID. It
          reads "Special Advisor, United States."

          DET. FINE
          You're saying this guy was a spook? You
          think this might be a political murder?

          DET. GALLAGHER
          I think that this is way bigger
          than the both of us.
          He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.

          EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news
          stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.
          We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the
          broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC

          SHEETING.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.
          Earlier today I came across what appeared
          to be a suicide. It was later learned to
          be a homicide. Someone's time was up.
          Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his
          pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the
          person whose POV we were in earlier.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I discovered a clue. Something I
          recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly
          . I heard my own clock ticking.
          We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--
          RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench
          coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS
          moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a
          Rorschach test. Scary looking.
          Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and
          FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches
          itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,
          Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

          With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic
          sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment. He
          investigates, silent. He sees the same things that the cops
          saw . . but he notices the speakers by the TV. Notices one
          of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew.
          Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the
          speaker was hollow. (The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun
          and put the cover back on when he left. Why?)

          INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

          Blake's clothing hangs in military rows. Rorschach runs his
          fingers along the wall-seams. He pauses, presses on the
          hanger BAR, which SLIDES BACK to reveal a RED BUTTON.
          Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN,
          revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRAMED
          PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included in
          this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook--he
          was a superhero.
          WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS,
          GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got it.
          But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention.
          Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current
          COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over it
          all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK.
          Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE
          BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last
          Laugh On Moloch." Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in
          the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero
          called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian
          named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.)
          On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of
          superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhattan,
          as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, and
          LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The
          caption below reads: "The New Watchmen."
          Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly
          closes the secret hatch.

          COP 2
          Nah, I definitely heard something.

          COP 1
          I tell ya, I'd rather do traffic duty
          than be posted at a crime scene all
          night. Watch the door.
          Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than
          being concerned. He then enters the bedroom.
          Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:

          COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Clear! I'm checking the other rooms.
          Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns--
          --and comes face to "face" with Rorschach, standing inches
          away. The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror. He goes
          to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, "Shhh"--
          The fingers JAB INTO THE COP'S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and
          falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper.

          HOLLIS (O.S.)
          See, the Comedian thought he had it all
          worked out.

          INT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PHOTO of the first Watchmen--identical to
          the old one in Blake's closet. Holding the photo is HOLLIS
          MASON. He puts the photo down, but we don't see his face yet.

          HOLLIS (O.S.)
          He was young and arrogant, but what he
          lacked in experience, he made up for in
          . tenacity.
          As he speaks, we PAN ACROSS various FRAMED MEMORABILIA: The
          first is a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING dated 1958: MYSTERIOUS MASKED
          MAN CLEANS UP WHARFS--the caption underneath reads "Hero
          Calls Himself The Nite Owl."

          HOLLIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Guess I was that way too, when I started.
          I'll never know what possessed me to put
          that mask on the first time.

          It started with the villains, y'know,

          ghosts. Gangs that thought it was funny
          to dress up and pull heists, crap like
          that.
          PAN ACROSS: Another FRAMED CLIPPING, dated 1962: NITE OWL
          FORMS WATCHMEN--COSTUMED HEROES COMBINING FORCES! "'We're
          going to clean up this town!' Says costumed crusader."

          HOLLIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          So a few cops, we decide it might be
          funny to mask up too. Be anonymous. Take
          these guys on at the street level, right?
          Then the media got wind, ran with it,
          turned it into a whole different beast.
          PAN ACROSS: A GOLD STATUE of NITE OWL in his Sixties-era
          costume. The plaque below reads: IN GRATITUDE, 1969. Another
          clipping: "Hero Retires, Reveals Identity In Tell All Book."
          Finally, we come to HOLLIS MASON (aka Nite Owl), 70s, though
          his eyes sparkle with strength and his face still shows the
          edges of a born hero. The TV is on in the background.

          HOLLIS (CONT'D)
          Superheroes, Supervillians--you know who
          I ran into the other day at the market?
          The Screaming Skull. We chatted for a
          while. Turns out he's a born again.

          DAN (V.0.)
          No way.
          We see who Hollis is speaking to--DAN DREIBERG (the second
          Nite Owl), late 30's, handsome, though he's let himself go
          the past few years--his edges have gone soft. He was in the
          photo of the new Watchmen in Blake's apartment.

          HOLLIS
          All the nuts that started popping up,
          I'll tell ya. Who was that midget you and
          your partner chased down years ago?
          What'd he call himself?

          DAN
          The Big Figure.

          HOLLIS
          Big Figure. A midget bad guy. Guess it
          doesn't get lower than that, does it?
          Hollis laughs at his own joke; Dan chuckles, polite.

          Wow, it's really late.
          Dan stands, finishes his beer. Hollis sees him to the door.

          HOLLIS
          Well, even though I spent my time
          catching real bad guys, you were still a
          better Nite Owl than I ever was.

          DAN
          That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it.
          They hug.

          HOLLIS
          With all this talk of war, all that's
          going on in the world, it's a shame the
          government forced all you guys out.
          Before Dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on
          the TV:

          ANCHORWOMAN
          This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach
          has assaulted a New York City police
          officer who was guarding a crime scene in
          the early morning hours. Rorschach is on
          the FBIs ten most wanted list for
          violation of the Keene Act, which banned
          masked heroes ten years ago.
          Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on
          screen.

          HOLLIS
          Well, forced all of you guys out except
          one.

          (BEAT)
          Next week?
          Dan nods, then leaves.

          EXT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Dan descends the stairs. He pulls up his collar against the
          cold and walks down an alley. A SIGN below Hollis' apartment
          reads: "MASON AUTO REPAIRS--Obsolete models a specialty!"

          INT. SUBWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Dan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of GANG
          MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him.
          ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far.

          GANG LEADER
          Move your leg.

          DAN
          What?

          GANG LEADER
          I said move, dick.
          Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his
          eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The
          Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass.

          EXT. DAN DREIBERG'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for
          his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert.
          His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED.
          There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house.

          INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen. He
          hears odd, metal scraping SOUNDS.

          INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find--

          DAN
          Rorschach.
          Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN

          OF BEANS.

          RORSCHACH
          Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some
          beans. You don't mind?

          DAN
          No, of course not. You uh, want me to
          heat some up for you?

          Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask
          back down. There's a strong familiarity between the two but
          at the same time, Dan is wary.

          DAN
          You were on the news. They say you
          attacked a cop.

          RORSCHACH
          Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.

          DAN
          Other than that . How have you been
          keeping?

          RORSCHACH
          Out of prison. So far. Look at this.
          He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it
          up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH.

          DAN
          This little stain, is that bean juice or--

          RORSCHACH
          Human bean juice. It belonged to the
          Comedian. He's dead.

          DAN
          The Comedian?
          Nervous now, Dan glances out the window.
          DAN (cont'd)
          Let's talk downstairs.

          INT. DAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

          Rorschach follows Dan to a CLOSET, at the end of the hall.
          Dan opens the closet, revealing an old BOOKSHELF. With some
          difficulty, Dan PULLS OPEN the HINGED BOOKSHELF with a RUSTY
          CREAK. STEEL STAIRS lead down into the dark.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The two men descend into Dan's WORKSHOP--the dusty remnants
          of a hero's LAB; Old computers and an OWL-COSTUME, hanging in
          a locker. No-one has been down here for years. In the center
          of the space, an OVAL VEHICLE the size of a subway car is
          covered by a dusty TARP--the Owl-Ship.

          Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might
          not have known who Blake was.

          RORSCHACH
          An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian?
          Ridiculous.

          DAN
          You're right. I heard he was working for
          the government. Maybe it was a political
          killing.

          RORSCHACH
          Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill
          off costumed heroes.

          DAN
          You don't think that's . a little
          paranoid?

          RORSCHACH
          Is that what they're saying about me now?
          That I'm paranoid?

          DAN
          I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot
          of enemies over the years, even amongst
          his friends, if he had any. The man
          wasn't exactly endearing. Just because
          something happened to him doesn't mean it
          involves us.

          RORSCHACH
          One of our own has been murdered. I
          thought you might be interested. An
          attack on one is an attack on all of us,
          right?
          Dan hesitates.

          DAN
          I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've
          all been out. Except you. You know that.

          RORSCHACH
          Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I'd
          let you know. Just in case.

          Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL.

          RORSCHACH
          I remember. Used to come here a lot.
          Back when we were partners.

          RORSCHACH
          You quit.
          Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to
          reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old costume hanging.

          INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          The kind of room you rent by the hour. Or the minute even. A
          cheap looking HOOKER enters with an ARMY OFFICER, giggling.
          She playfully pushes the Officer onto the bed.

          HOOKER
          So tell me what you wanna do. Sir.

          ARMY OFFICER
          Seeing that I don't have to be back to
          base till Friday--everything.
          He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser. Then takes his
          UNIFORM off like he can't wait. The Hooker gets on top of him-
          --when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in,
          yanks the Hooker off--
          --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which
          Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy's arm, then KICKS
          the Officer on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to
          shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor--
          Rorschach nails him in the head with a BLACK JACK, knocking
          him out.
          The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS
          her face into the wall.

          RORSCHACH
          Quiet, whore.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          14.

          CONTINUED:
          Nose broken and bleeding, the Hooker quiets to a whimper.
          Rorschach takes the officer's uniform and ID. Then leaves.

          EXT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - MORNING

          A mammoth, shining skyscraper. At the 50th-floor there is a
          HUGE V-SHAPED HOLE where WATER FALLS.

          INT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - LOBBY - MORNING

          A mammoth lobby. The decor is Egyptian and marble. Dan
          approaches a beautiful ASSISTANT behind an imposing desk.

          DAN
          I'm here to see Adrian Veidt.

          ASSISTANT
          Do you have an appointment?

          DAN
          No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is
          here to see him.

          ASSISTANT
          I'm sorry, Mr. Veidt doesn't see anyone
          without an appointment.

          DAN
          I understand, but if you would just tell
          Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an
          old friend.

          ASSISTANT
          Well, Mr. Veidt is very busy at the

          MOMENT--

          DAN
          Just tell him I'm here. I assure you
          he'll see me.
          Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken.
          She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office.
          Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by
          nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him--
          it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS
          eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns.

          ASSISTANT
          Go on in, Mr. Dreiberg.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Dan enters the enormous office--there are three TV feeds
          PROJECTED onto the walls, architectural models of real estate
          developments, poster size ad campaigns for "Nostalgia"
          perfume--all reflecting the financial empire of Veidt
          Enterprises owned by--
          --ADRIAN VEIDT, late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end
          of the office, SPRINTING on a treadmill as journalist DOUG
          ROTH holds a tape recorder to him. Adrian sees Dan
          approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling Dan
          to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch. Picks
          up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover.

          DOUG ROTH
          Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you
          are considered the world's smartest man?

          ADRIAN

          (LAUGHS)
          I think it's better to be the world's
          most modest man. You should ignore my PR
          people, they tend to be a little too
          enthusiastic.
          Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly
          seems out of breath as he answers questions.

          DOUG ROTH
          If we could move off the subject of
          business for a moment, I'm curious
          whether the world's smartest man thinks
          we're headed for our next World War.
          Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan.

          ADRIAN
          Predicting stock prices isn't the same as
          predicting world events. I hope there
          isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that
          matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has
          some exciting plans, plans that will,
          pardon the cliche, truly make this world
          a better place. My team of engineers and
          scientists have been working with Dr.
          Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new,
          cheap form of energy which will eliminate
          the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with
          no toxic emissions. This energy could
          power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there
          are no limitations--

          CONTINUED:

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          --but I talk too much. Will you mind
          pausing the interview a moment, Doug? A
          good friend of mine is here.
          Doug Roth leaves. Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat.

          DAN
          You look good, Adrian.

          ADRIAN
          Dan--it's been far too long.

          INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - LATER

          Dan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an
          ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias).

          ADRIAN
          Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.

          DAN
          He did? Must've been tough to get past
          your security, even for him. I thought
          your assistant was going to take me out.

          ADRIAN

          (LAUGHS)
          Sara can be tough. Is that why you came
          to see me? You're worried about this mask
          killer theory Rorschach's conjured up?

          DAN
          You're the world's smartest man, Adrian.
          You tell me.

          ADRIAN
          Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through
          nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the
          public as soon as the Keene Act was
          passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it
          would have been done already.
          Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors.
          Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian
          border. Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          No, there are other things in the world
          I'm far more concerned about.
          ON THE WALL: The TV projector shows an image of TWO PAKISTANI
          SOLDIERS on patrol.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          EXT. PAKISTAN/INDIA BORDER (KASHMIR) - SAME TIME

          We're now actually with the two Soldiers on patrol. One of
          the Soldiers takes out a pair of binoculars, looking into the
          mountains. (They speak in Baluchi)

          PAKISTANI SOLDIER
          We should attack the Indian bastards. I
          don't understand--
          CUT TO: POV--a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the Pakistani
          soldier.

          INDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
          --why I can't just pull this trigger.
          We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with
          his sniper rifle aimed. (They speak in Hindi)

          INDIAN SOLDIER #2
          Because then a battle begins. Then a war.
          And then the Americans will send--

          INT. BRIDGE - BATTLESHIP - CHINESE WATERS - SAME TIME


          CHINESE CAPTAIN
          (in Mandarin)
          --their blue abomination to intervene.
          And we don't want that. At the same time,
          we can't assume to know what's on the
          minds of our enemies.
          We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE
          CAPTAIN and his First Mate look out at the water. TAIWANESE
          GUNBOATS can be seen in the distance.

          INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - ISRAEL - SAME TIME

          We're in the control room as an ISRAELI OFFICER and his much
          younger AIDE watch SATELLITE IMAGES on the giant screen.
          Images of potential targets. (They speak in Hebrew)

          AIDE
          Is Dr. Manhattan even real?

          ISRAELI OFFICER
          Why don't you ask the Vietnamese. Or the
          Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god
          for that.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - EVENING

          A SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER
          MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the
          gate.
          We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The
          guard has no reaction to Rorschach--
          --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army
          Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The
          Guard waves him through.

          INT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING

          Rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask
          on. He quietly enters--

          INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

          --a huge room, which contains technologically advanced
          MILITARY DEVICES. Distorted in sections of GLASS, we see the
          REFLECTION of a HUGE MAN, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE--

          DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
          Good evening, Rorschach.
          --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the
          very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples
          from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He
          works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air--
          not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan
          already knew he was coming.

          RORSCHACH
          Dr. Manhattan.
          Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his
          girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime,
          enters from the other end.

          LAURIE
          Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What
          are you doing here? You're a wanted man.

          RORSCHACH
          Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

          LAURIE
          Don't call me that. My mother made me
          take that name. I always hated it.

          19.

          CONTINUED:

          RORSCHACH
          Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should
          tell you the bad news--the Comedian has
          been murdered.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes, since he and I are the only two
          extranormal operatives currently employed
          by the government, I was informed. The
          CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic
          groups.
          Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He
          speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner.

          RORSCHACH
          I have my own theories. But neither of
          you seem too concerned.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          A live human body and a dead human body
          have the same number of particles.
          Structurally there's no difference.

          LAURIE
          Well, I might not be able to count
          molecules, but either way, Blake was a
          bastard. You know he tried to rape my
          mother?

          RORSCHACH
          Sounds like you may have had a score to
          settle. You or your mother.

          LAURIE
          What? Are you accusing--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Rorschach, please don't upset Laurie. I

          DON'T--
          He pauses as if he hears something.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Excuse me for a moment.
          Suddenly he disappears.

          EXT. PORT OF LONG BEACH - CONTINUOUS

          A group of suspicious looking MIDDLE EASTERN MEN watch as a
          CONTAINER is being loaded onto a TRUCK--

          --when suddenly Dr. Manhattan materializes in a blue flash,
          floating in mid-air. The Middle Eastern Men shield their eyes
          from the light, then realize in awe and fear

          MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
          (in Arabic)
          It's him He's, he's real. Allah
          help us, he's real!
          The men run for it but it's useless--Dr. Manhattan shoots
          BEAMS OF ENERGY at them, freezing all the men in mid motion--
          --when PORT SECURITY pulls up. They get out of their jeeps,
          in awe of Dr. Manhattan, still floating in mid-air.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          These men were transporting a shipment of
          enriched uranium--
          With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and
          separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside.
          Suddenly the uranium changes--

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          I've safely transformed the uranium into
          sand. I trust you can take things from
          here.
          And just like that he disappears--

          INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

          --and is back in the lab without missing a beat.

          RORSCHACH
          --I'm not here to judge the moral
          discrepancies of a man who died in
          service of his country.

          LAURIE
          You call rape a moral discrepancy?!

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Rorschach--you're upsetting Laurie. I
          think you ought to go.

          RORSCHACH
          I came here to warn you both, just like I
          warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone
          may be targeting masked heroes--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I said you ought to go.

          With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach disappear.

          EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - CONTINUOUS

          Rorschach materializes down the road from the base.

          RORSCHACH
          --had my say
          Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his
          surroundings. Reorients himself. With nothing else he can do,
          he heads down the road.

          INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME

          Dr. Manhattan resumes his work. He looks distracted.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          He's gone. Are you okay now?

          LAURIE

          YEAH
          (studies Dr. Manhattan)
          Are you okay, Jon?
          Dr. Manhattan pauses for a moment, thoughtful.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm having trouble with my vision. I
          can't see clearly what lies ahead.
          There's some static interference.

          LAURIE
          Interference? Caused by what?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm uncertain. A power surge of great
          magnitude? Perhaps a nuclear detonation.

          LAURIE
          More war talk. I can't deal with this. I
          don't want to think about the future
          right now.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          There's no such thing as the "future."
          I've explained to you on many occasions--

          LAURIE
          --that time is simultaneous. There's no
          past to travel back to, no future to
          travel forward to, everything happens all
          at once, our actions affect the course of
          time instantly, yes I know.

          (BEAT)
          I'm sorry, it's just a little
          unnerving to be with someone who can see
          the future, or whatever you call it.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I understand your frustration, Laurie.
          The human mind for some reason is only
          capable of viewing time frame by frame.
          Perhaps you'd find it more comforting if
          you could perceive time as I do
          Dr. Manhattan touches her head--

          Laurie's childhood home. We're in Laurie's POV, as a little
          girl. There's arguing downstairs. Laurie goes down to
          investigate.
          She comes upon the kitchen door, ajar. She can see her
          PARENTS inside, arguing--

          LAURIE (V.0.)
          Jon, stop!

          INT. LABORATORY - EVENING

          Back in the present, Laurie pulls away from Dr. Manhattan's
          touch. That memory seems to be painful for her.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I didn't mean to upset you.

          LAURIE
          I know. I think I've been cooped up on
          this base for too long. Rorschach
          mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen
          him in years. Maybe we can give him a
          call, see if he's available for dinner
          tonight.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You go ahead, Laurie. I want to further
          investigate this interference with my
          vision. I find it troubling.

          Laurie, dressed up and looking gorgeous, heads out when she's
          stopped by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT FORBES.

          AGENT FORBES
          Going somewhere, Miss Jupiter?

          LAURIE
          Out.

          AGENT FORBES
          I'll have a car brought around in a few
          minutes.

          LAURIE
          No, thank you. I called a cab already--
          it's waiting for me outside.
          She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in front of
          her.

          AGENT FORBES
          You look quite nice. Who are you meeting?

          LAURIE
          An old friend of mine. And of Dr.
          Manhattan's. Now step out of my way.

          AGENT FORBES
          Please keep in mind, Ms. Jupiter, that
          your boyfriend is this country's most
          valuable asset. You need to keep him
          happy. And on our side.
          Laurie glares at him.

          LAURIE
          Yes, sir.
          She brushes past him as she leaves.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

          We move down the beautifully lit New York city skyline,
          passing the Brooklyn Bridge . the Statue of Liberty
          and the in Towers of the World Trade Center?
          We hear the LAUGHTER--

          

          

          

          

          24.

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          --of Dan and Laurie as they finish up their meal at this
          trendy restaurant.

          LAURIE
          You remember that crazy guy, what did he
          call himself . Captain Carnage!
          Pretended to be a supervillian just so he
          could get beat up all the time?

          DAN
          Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just
          walked away but he starts following me
          down the street in broad daylight
          yelling, "punish me! punish me!"

          LAURIE

          (LAUGHS)
          Whatever happened to him?

          DAN
          Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and
          Rorschach dropped him down an elevator
          shaft.
          They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter.

          LAURIE
          Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't
          remember the last time I laughed like
          this. It feels good.
          Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's
          smitten with her and that he probably has been for years.
          Laurie seems oblivious.

          DAN
          It's great seeing you again, Laurie.

          LAURIE
          Yeah, this was fun.
          The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it.

          DAN
          You sure I can't get that?

          LAURIE
          Let me put my expense account to use. You
          can thank Uncle Sam.

          CONTINUED:
          Laurie nods out the window. Dan turns and sees a GOVERNMENT
          SEDAN parked outside.

          DAN
          They've been watching the whole time?

          LAURIE
          Just making sure I'm not doing anything
          that might upset the country's most
          powerful weapon.

          DAN
          How is Jon, by the way?

          LAURIE
          I really don't know. It's been harder and
          harder to tell over the years. It's like
          his emotions are slowly eroding. To be
          honest, I can't tell if he even cares
          about me anymore.
          They're quiet a moment. Laurie glances at her watch.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          I should get back.

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie step outside.

          LAURIE
          Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do
          it? Why did we dress up like that? I
          think the Keene Act was the best thing to
          ever happen to us.

          DAN
          You're probably right.

          LAURIE
          I mean, you remember my costume? All that
          tight spandex? That was awful.

          DAN
          Uh, yeah. Awful.

          LAURIE
          And to think my own mother pushed me into
          that spandex. Pushed me into the whole
          costume thing in the first place. Wanted
          her little girl to be just like mommy and
          fight bad guys.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)

          (BEAT)
          Well, I guess my ride is here.
          She gives Dan a hug.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          We'll do this again.

          DAN
          Yeah. I'd really like that.
          Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan
          watches the car drive off, TWO KIDS nearly bump into him,
          running around playing. The Kids make flying noises.

          KID 1
          I'm Dr. Manhattan, saving the Twin
          Towers!

          KID 2
          No, I wanna be Dr. Manhattan!

          MOTHER
          You can take turns, okay?
          Dan watches the Kids for a moment, then walks away. The Twin
          Towers looming behind him.

          EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

          Days later. A few mourners gather in the rain for Edward
          Blake aka The Comedian's funeral. Mostly government types.
          Dan, Adrian and Dr. Manhattan line the edge of an open grave.

          INT. HALLWAY - SALLY JUPITER'S CONDO - LOS ANGELES, CA - DAY

          Laurie MATERIALIZES in the hallway of her mother's condo in
          California. She immediately runs to the bathroom.

          EXT. NEPENTHE VISTA - SAME TIME

          Bright California sunshine gleams over this upscale condo
          facility. Laurie's mother, SALLY, 60s but looks in her 40s,
          reclines by the POOL. She hears someone VOMITING in her
          condo.

          SALLY
          Laurie? Is that you?

          INT. SALLY'S CONDO - DAY

          Sally steps through the sliding glass doors as we hear the
          toilet FLUSHING. Laurie wobbles out of the bathroom.

          CONTINUED:

          SALLY
          I'd figure you'd be used to traveling
          that way by now.

          LAURIE
          Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon
          teleports me.

          SALLY
          Margarita?

          LAURIE
          No.
          Sally pours herself a margarita from a pitcher on the
          counter. We see photos, remnants of Sally from her
          crimefighting days around the condo. Under the pitcher of
          margaritas is a days old LA Times with the headline: "Dr.
          Manhattan Intercepts Terrorists At Port."

          SALLY
          It's Eddie Blake's funeral today, isn't
          it?
          Laurie nods. (From here on, intercut between Blake's funeral
          and Sally's condo)
          FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is removed from the hearse.

          SALLY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Finally got his punchline, I guess. Poor
          Eddie.

          LAURIE
          Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After
          what he--

          SALLY
          Laurie, you're still young. You don't
          understand how things change as time goes
          by.
          FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is carried past Adrian, Dan and Dr.
          Manhattan.

          LAURIE (V.0.)
          Another lesson on time passing. Y'know,
          you and Jon should get together and write
          a book on the subject.
          Sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of
          the Watchmen, the same one with Blake and Hollis Mason in it.

          That leaves just two of the old team
          left. Me and Hollis Mason.
          She stops at Blake in the photo, regarding him.

          EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON


          SALLY (V.O.)
          Eddie was the Comedian. He always thought
          he'd get the last laugh.
          As the PRIEST speaks, we move down the row of mourners,
          stopping at Dr. Manhattan looking thoughtfully into Blake's

          GRAVE

          INT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK - 1964)

          MATCH CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan. In the night sky, a BURST of
          FIREWORKS. Outside, a CROWD of Vietnamese people CHEER.

          BLAKE (O.S.)
          Fireworks.
          A young Blake sits in a derelict Saigon bar, mean drunk. His
          face is devoid of his trademark scar.

          BLAKE (CONT'D)
          You'd think this country'd had enough
          goddamn fireworks. If we'd've lost this
          war, I think it might have driven us
          crazy, y'know? As a country. But we
          didn't. Thanks to you.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You sound bitter.

          BLAKE
          Me? I think it's hilarious.

           VIETNAMESE GIRL (O.S.)
          Mr. Eddie?
          They both turn. A pretty VIETNAMESE GIRL stands in the door.
          She's pregnant, just starting to show.

          BLAKE
          Fantastic. Just what I need.

          VIETNAMESE GIRL
          The war is over now. We must talk.
          (touching her abdomen)

          Blake SLAMS his glass down. He glares at her, drunk and
          dangerous.

          BLAKE
          There's nothing to talk about cuz I'm
          leaving. I'm gonna forget you and your
          horrible, sweaty little country.
          He turns away. Her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred.

          VIETNAMESE GIRL
          No. You will remember. You will remember
          me and my country forever.
          She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns just as the broken SHARDS
          SLASH HIS FACE, slicing him his jagged scar

          BLAKE
          You bitch! My face!
          He PUSHES HER into the bar and DRAWS HIS PISTOL--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Blake . don't.
          BLAM! Blake shoots her; the Girl SLAMS against the far wall.
          She drops, dead.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned her
          down.
          Blake turns on him, spitting fury.

          BLAKE
          That's right! And you know what? You
          watched me! You could've changed the gun
          into steam or the bullets into mercury or
          the bottle into snowflakes, but you
          didn't, did you? You're drifting outta
          touch, Doc--I've seen it. Don't tell me
          the war got to you.
          Blake walks off shouting "Medic!" Dr. Manhattan turns to the
          girl's body and regards it, curious. MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK 15 YEARS AGO)


          BLAKE (V.0.)
          This is all bullshit.
          Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the
          meeting of the "new" Watchmen. Rorschach is there, as is a
          teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex costume. Dr.
          Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend
          JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young
          Laurie . who definitely glances back. Dan also pays
          Laurie attention, but she is oblivious.
          A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the meeting.

          ADRIAN
          What are you saying, Comedian?
          Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table,
          a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: "Arab Leaders
          Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan."'

          BLAKE
          What I'm saying is this whole bringing
          back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It
          didn't work twenty years ago, and it
          ain't gonna work just because you want to
          keep on playing Cowboys and Indians.

          DAN
          Maybe we should agree on no drinking at
          meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made
          real headway on the gang problem by
          pooling our efforts.
          Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.

          RORSCHACH
          That's true. But something like this
          seems too big. Too bureaucratic.

          ADRIAN
          Bureaucracies can be effective with the
          right leadership--

          BLAKE
          And that would be you, right Veidt? I
          mean you're the "smartest guy in the
          world," right?

          ADRIAN
          It doesn't take a genius to see that the
          world has problems.

          BLAKE
          But it takes a roomful of morons to think
          they're small enough for you guys to
          handle. You people are a joke. You hear
          Moloch's back in town and get your
          panties in a bunch. You think that
          matters?

          RORSCHACH
          Of course it does. Justice matters.

          BLAKE
          Justice. Hilarious. There's no such thing
          as justice.
          He stands, moving to Adrian's DISPLAY which outlines the
          Watchmen's agenda: GANGS, RACKETEERING, DRUGS. Blake flicks
          his ZIPPO and the display GOES UP IN FLAMES.

          ADRIAN
          My display .

          BLAKE
          Justice doesn't matter, alright? Because
          twenty years from now we're all gonna be
          dust. Mankind's been trying to kill each
          other off since the beginning of time and
          now we finally got the power to finish
          the job. Ain't nothin' gonna matter when
          the nukes start flying, and I promise you
          they will. Then Ozymandias here is gonna
          be the smartest man on the cinder.
          He sneers and walks out. Silence. Uncomfortable in the wake
          of truth, the others pack up to go, muttering apologies to
          Adrian, but Adrian ignores them, staring at the flames
          flickering across his face. He seems more thoughtful than
          upset. MATCH CUT TO:

          aside with his rifle butt, then starts firing rubber bullets
          into the crowd. The protestors scatter and retreat. Dan lands

          Protection from what?
          Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos.

          BLAKE
          Are you kidding? From themselves.
          CLOSE ON: the happy face pin on Blake's costume. MATCH CUT TO-

          EXT. CEMETERY - EVENING

          --Dan fingering Blake's happy face pin.

          PRIEST
          Lord have mercy upon us. Amen.
          Dan DROPS the pin into Blake's grave. The mourners linger a
          moment as dirt is shoveled onto Blake's casket, then start
          filing out. We follow one particular mourner all the way in
          the back--a LONE MAN, as he walks away.

          EXT. CEMETERY GATES - CONTINUOUS

          The Lone Man leaves quickly.

          INT. MOLOCH'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          The Lone Man removes his hat and coat. He is old, withered.
          He is EDGAR JACOBI. In his younger days, he was a
          supervillain known as MOLOCH--we recognize him from the news
          clipping in Blake's closet.

          INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Moloch goes to the REFRIGERATOR, opens it. Then stops,
          staring. There is a scrawled NOTE inside. Moloch picks it up--
          in spiky handwriting it reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU."
          Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As
          Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind his
          back and SLAMS him to the floor.

          RORSCHACH
          Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar
          William Vaughn. Also known as William
          Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch.

          MOLOCH
          What are you talking about? I'm a retired
          business maaAAAHHH!

          CONTINUED:
          Rorschach TWISTS the man's arm back viciously.

          RORSCHACH
          Lie again, I'll break your arm.

          MOLOCH
          Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not
          Moloch anymore. What do you want from me?
          Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him.

          RORSCHACH
          You attended a funeral today. Why?

          MOLOCH
          The funeral? I don't know why I went. I
          just felt I should. I'd been thinking
          about the Comedian--
          Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall.

          RORSCHACH
          How did you know Blake was the Comedian?

          MOLOCH
          He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had
          his mask off. He was drunk--

          RORSCHACH
          You were enemies for forty years. Why
          would he visit you?

          MOLOCH
          I don't know! I woke up in my bedroom and
          there he was! He was upset! Crying!

          RORSCHACH
          The Comedian? Crying?

          MOLOCH
          He, he was babbling, not making sense. I
          was pissing in my pants--I thought he was
          going to kill me!

          RORSCHACH
          What did he say?!

          MOLOCH
          He said he was wrong. About it all being
          a joke, that it wasn't funny anymore. He
          said he was scared--

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          35.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          RORSCHACH
          Scared of what?!

          MOLOCH
          Something he saw, I think. He said
          something about wishing he never broke
          into that building. But that he had to
          keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left!
          Rorschach studies Moloch a moment, then releases him.

          RORSCHACH
          Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable.
          Probably true.
          Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers,
          looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through
          it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from
          "Pyramid Industries."

          MOLOCH
          So that's it? I'm clean?

          RORSCHACH
          Clean? I searched your house. Found
          illegal drugs.

          MOLOCH
          Illegal--I don't use drugs.
          Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat.

          RORSCHACH
          Laetril. Phony medication made from
          apricot pits. Illegal.

          MOLOCH
          oh c-come on. Look, please don't
          confiscate that. I'm trying anything
          . I have cancer.

          RORSCHACH
          What kind of cancer?

          MOLOCH
          The kind you don't get better from.

          RORSCHACH
          Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If
          you remember anything else, leave me a
          note in the trash can opposite the Gunga
          Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out
          of trouble, Moloch.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: Rorschach blasting through the night air as the
           city streams by. This close, he appears to be flying.

           RORSCHACH (V.0.)
           Rorschach's Journal, October 17th.
          Thought about Moloch's story on my way to
          the cemetery. Could all be lies. A scheme
          for revenge planned during his years
          behind bars.
          CUT WIDE: To reveal he is actually PERCHED ATOP AN ELEVATED
          SUBWAY CAR. Just one way he gets around.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          But if it's true, then what? What could
          have possibly scared the Comedian? What
          building was he talking about? What was
          it that he saw? So many questions.

          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

          Rorschach stands alone over Blake's fresh grave. Paying his
          proper respects.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          Edward Blake--the Comedian. Born 1944,
          buried in the rain. Murdered.
          FLASH TO: Blake, the night of his murder, turning as his door
          is kicked in.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Violent lives ending violently.
          FLASH TO: Adrian's display burning.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Blake understood. Humans are violent in
          nature. No matter how much you try to
          dress it up, to disguise it.
          FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the
          photo of the new Watchmen.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Blake saw the true face of human kind and
          chose to become a parody of it, treated
          it like a joke.
          FLASHES OF: Blake being beaten in his apartment.

          CONTINUED:

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I heard a joke once. Man goes to a
          doctor, says he's depressed. Life seems
          harsh and cruel.
          Blake is KICKED in the stomach.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Says he feels all alone in a threatening
          world.
          Blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Doctor says, "the treatment is simple.
          The great clown Pagliacci is in town
          tonight. Go and see him. That should pick
          you up."
          Blake is lifted up by the Intruder's hands.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The man bursts into tears.
          A bloodied Blake laughs at the Intruder.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          "But doctor," he says.
          ULTRA-SLOW, Blake crashes through his apartment window.

           RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          "I am Pagliacci."
          Blake FLIES TOWARD FRAME on his silent trip to the ground.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Good joke. Everybody laugh.
          Blake FALLS INTO FRAME--GO BLACK .

          INT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

          CLOSE ON: Laurie, eyes closed with pleasure, as Dr.
          Manhattan's GLOWING BLUE HANDS caress her face.

          LAURIE
          Mmm. What time do you have to be at your
          TV interview?

          DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
          Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

          CONTINUED:
          Eyes still closed, she does not see a THIRD BLUE HAND trace a
          line down her cheek. She kisses it.

          LAURIE
          Hey, your finger, it's like licking a
          battery. It's all--
          She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as she
          sees TWO DR. MANHATTANS in bed with her.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          Oh God! That's horrible! Stop it!
          Laurie jumps up. The two Dr. Manhattans stand, confused.

          DR. MANHATTAN 1 DR. MANHATTAN 2
          Please don't be upset. I thought you'd enjoy it.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I--You startled me, that's all

          DR. MANHATTAN 1
          I don't know what stimulates you anymore.
          Laurie backs into the hall, trying to get a grip.

          LAURIE
          Forget about it. I overreacted. It was
          just strange to see--
          Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD DR.
          MANHATTAN is working on an experiment. Her eyes blaze.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          How long have you been working in here?

          DR. MANHATTAN 1
          Laurie, try to understand--

          LAURIE
          Understand!? You're working in here at
          the same time we're in bed!?

          DR. MANHATTAN 3
          My work with Adrian is at an important
          stage. It seemed unnecessary to--

          LAURIE
          Shut up! Just SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
          Laurie WHIPS a full BEAKER at 3's chest. It PASSES THROUGH
          HIM and SMASHES IN THE KITCHEN SINK. Laurie storms out.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          39.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          DR. MANHATTAN 3
          Laurie, please--If you think there's a
          problem with my attitude, I'm prepared to
          discuss it--
          As he speaks, the smashed BEAKER and its contents RISE INTO
          THE AIR, REASSEMBLING perfectly in the palm of 3's hand.
          IN THE HALL: Laurie nearly bumps into Dr. Manhattan 2.

          DR. MANHATTAN 2
          --but logically, not clouded with human
          emotion.

          LAURIE
          Human emotion? You were human once.
          That's the problem, Jon. You've forgotten
          that.

          DR. MANHATTAN 2
          Laurie, where are you--
          The door slams. Laurie's left. For good.
          Dr. Manhattan 2 stands there. He walks back to the BEDROOM
          where 1 is. Dr. Manhattan 1 holds an OLD PHOTO. In the photo
          is a COUPLE, smiling into the camera. We recognize the woman
          as Janey Slater, Dr. Manhattan's ex-girlfriend, who we saw in
          Adrian's flashback at Blake's funeral. We recognize the man
          in the photo as . Dr. Manhattan. When he was human.
          Dr. Manhattan stares at the photo. Perhaps feeling the tingle
          of human emotion again

          INT. DAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

          Dan heats up some leftover Chinese food in the microwave as
          the TV plays in the B/G:

          NEWS ANALYST (V.O.)
          --no one's fired their weapons yet, but
          no one's lowered them either. Maybe these
          other countries aren't so afraid of Dr.
          Manhattan, maybe they're calling the
          President's bluff. I'm very curious to
          see what Dr. Manhattan himself has to say
          in his live interview which should be in
          about an hour or so
          BOOM, BOOM! Dan looks up. Someone's banging on the door.
          Hard.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          Dan approaches the door, cautious, mask killer on his mind?

          DAN
          Who is it?

          LAURIE (O.S.)
          It's Laurie.

          DAN
          Laurie?
          It takes a few moments for him to open the door.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it's a
          little sticky--

          LAURIE
          I left Jon.

          INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Dan pours a teary eyed Laurie a glass of RED WINE.

          DAN
          Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you
          here?

          LAURIE
          I lost them in the subways. I think.

          DAN
          I'm really sorry, Laurie.

          LAURIE
          Living with him . Dan, you don't know
          what it's been like.
          INTERCUT TO: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie's BRA. Staring.

          LAURIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The way he looks at things, like he can't
          remember what they are, like he doesn't
          really care. This world, the real world
          to him it's like walking through
          mist, and all the people are just
          shadows. Shadows in the fog.
          Dr. Manhattan lowers his head. A SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. He
          looks up to see a THREE PIECE SUIT floating before him--
          waiting for its wearer.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie walk the streets, getting some air.

          LAURIE
          I hope I didn't ruin your night.

          DAN
          Not at all. I was just going to see
          Hollis for our weekly beer session.
          You're more than welcome to join. In
          fact, I insist
          They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless
          Man is arguing with the News Vendor:

          NEWS VENDOR
          --I told you, this month's issue still
          hasn't arrived yet! Why do you care about
          that right wing rag so much? Cuz those
          bastards don't give a damn about you,
          pal! They--hold up, here it comes.
          They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a
          BUNDLE of the latest issue of "The New Frontiersman."
          CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan stepping THROUGH and INTO the empty,
          floating suit. His TIE knots itself.
          Dr. Manhattan looks around the empty room . sad? Again,
          he looks at the photo of him and Janey Slater . . then

          DISAPPEARS IN A BURST OF PARTICLES.

          EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

          Dan and Laurie turn down a darker, less populated street.

          DAN
          Laurie, will you please stop apologizing?
          I'm here for you anytime.
          SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following.

          Suddenly, Dr. Manhattan appears in a burst of energy. The
          receptionist SHRIEKS. The PRODUCER looks out his office.

          PRODUCER
          Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no
          one thinks to tell me?

          RECEPTIONIST
          He, he just--

          PRODUCER
          All geez. We don't have time for make-up.
          That blue is too light for television.
          The light from Dr. Manhattan's SKIN DARKENS to a DEEPER BLUE.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Is this dark enough?

          PRODUCER
          Uh, yeah

          EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

          Dan and Laurie turn down an alley. We now see who's following
          them--a group of YOUNG THUGS.

          PRODUCER (V.0.)
          that's dark enough.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - BACK STAGE - SAME TIME

          A White House PRESS AGENT escorts Dr. Manhattan to the set.

          PRESS AGENT
          Just another reminder that if the second
          Geneva Convention comes up, our official
          position is that talks will not resume
          until the Chinese agree to exclude you
          from the agenda. The President approved
          this interview because he wanted to
          strengthen morale at home and to gently
          remind the rest of the world who holds
          the cards. Please keep that in mind.
          Dr. Manhattan stands off stage, waiting. The LIGHTS come up

          ALLEYWAY. One of the Thugs pulls a KNIFE. Laurie and Dan
          exchange a look. Dan removes his glasses. CUT BACK TO:

          NEWS HOST (CONT'D)
          His given name is Jonathan Osterman--Dr.
          Jonathan Osterman--a renowned nuclear
          physicist who through a terrible accident
          became the man the world knows today as
          Dr. Manhattan.
          The audience APPLAUDS loudly as Dr. Manhattan takes his seat.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Thank you.

          NEWS HOST
          Thank you, Dr. Manhattan, and not simply
          for appearing on this program. I believe
          I speak for all of America when I thank
          you for thwarting the terrorist plot at
          the port of Long Beach over a week ago--
          Furious applause from the audience, which Dr. Manhattan
          regards curiously.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          It was my duty.
           CUT TO: Dan and Laurie surrounded by the Thugs . when
          suddenly they DIVE INTO the group, fighting like the heroes
          they once were.
          Dan grapples with one of the Thugs and knocks his knife away--
          --when another Thug nails him from behind with a BAT. Dan
          drops to the ground . BACK TO:

          NEWS HOST
          Before we start, I want to explain to our
          viewers the unconventional format for
          this interview. Our live audience is made
          up entirely of news media and Dr.
          Manhattan will be taking questions from
          the floor. This commercial free broadcast
          is presented to you by Veidt Enterprises.
          We see Adrian standing near the audience with the Press
          Agent, smiling for the camera.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          CUT TO: Laurie, driving a FIST into a Thug's NOSE, when
          another Thug GRABS HER HAIR.

          NEWS HOST (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          We will now take our first question--
          The Thug draws a PISTOL on her. Dan, still on the ground,
          sees the gun and his eyes narrow, harden. He pushes himself
          up off the ground.
          CUT BACK TO: The TV Studio AUDIENCE: where Doug Roth, the
          journalist who interviewed Adrian earlier, stands.

          DOUG ROTH
          Dr. Manhattan, Doug Roth, Nova Times. Do
          you remember a man named Wally Weaver?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes, he was a good friend of mine. When
          we were both physicists.

          DOUG ROTH
          He died of cancer.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I remember. I attended his funeral.

          DOUG ROTH
          How about Edgar Jacobi, also known as the
          supervillian Moloch? You had a lot of
          battles with him, didn't you? Did you
          know that he has cancer as-well?
          The News Host looks confused. Adrian turns to the Press
          Agent, growing concerned with where this is leading.
          CUT TO: Dan, snapping the GUNMAN'S wrist back and up--
          Barrel aimed at the Thug's CHIN. In the last fraction of a
          second, Dan SHIFTS the gun two inches left as it FIRES,
          deafening the Thug, but leaving him alive. BACK TO:

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I was not aware--

          DOUG ROTH
          And what about Jose Flores? He was the
          longtime janitor at the Watchmen
          Headquarters where you worked for many
          years. Cancer.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          45.

          CONTINUED: (3)

          DR. MANHATTAN
          By your line of questioning, you're
          suggesting that I was the cause of cancer
          in these individuals.

          DOUG ROTH
          You tell me, doc.
          Adrian turns to him.

          ADRIAN
          Doug, that `s enough.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          It is irrelevant whether I was the cause
          or not.

          DOUG ROTH
          Irrelevant?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          A live human body and a dead human body
          have the same number of particles.
          Structurally there's no difference.
          An appalled then angry buzz comes over the audience.

          DOUG ROTH
          What about Janey Slater? Do you think it
          makes a difference to her?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Janey Slater? Wh--

          DOUG ROTH
          Your ex-girlfriend, she was a physicist
          too. You were with her for ten years. Or
          does she have to remind you herself?
          Suddenly Janey Slater emerges from a door at the top of the
          stands. She is old now, frail, barely recognizable from the
          images we've see of her.

          DOUG ROTH (CONT'D)
          She has cancer as well. Doctors have
          given her six months. What do you have to
          say, Ms. Slater?
          He sticks the microphone in her face.

          JANEY SLATER
          D-damn you, Jon. God damn you

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          46.

          CONTINUED: (4)
          She leaves as fast as she came, bursting into tears. Dr.
          Manhattan stands, visibly shaken--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          No, Janey, wait!
          In the audience, Adrian turns to the Press Agent, frantic.

          ADRIAN
          We need to stop this now.
          Adrian and the Press Agent hurry on stage, SECURITY
          following.

          PRESS AGENT
          That's it! Interview's over!
          BACK TO: The alley, littered with the unconscious BODIES of
          the Thugs. Laurie and Dan lean back on the wall, gasping for
          air, horribly out of shape, but victorious.
          CUT TO: The TV studio, as Adrian and Security surround Dr.
          Manhattan, trying to escort him out. The audience spills out
          of the stands, RUSHING Dr. Manhattan with questions and,
          FLASHING cameras--it's madness. Adrian shoves a camera out of
          Dr. Manhattan's face.

          ADRIAN
          As the sponsor of this program I demand
          all cameras off!
          His plea is futile, of course. A REPORTER breaks through,
          gets in Dr. Manhattan's face.

          REPORTER 1
          Did you give Ms. Slater cancer by
          sleeping with her?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          No. Please let me through

          REPORTER 2
          Do you even care about human life?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Please. If everyone would just go away
          and leave me alone.
          Adrian hears the note of warning in his voice.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (5)

          ADRIAN
          Everyone back off! Don't you understand?
          He's the only thing preventing the world
          from chaos!

          DOUG ROTH
          How many other people did you do this to?
          Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I said LEAVE ME ALONE!
          Every last person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr.
          Manhattan is suddenly alone. He looks stunned almost.

          EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME

          The TV audience materializes out on the roof

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie exit the quiet alley, trying to play it off.

          LAURIE
          I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us
          getting mugged.

          DAN
          Why don't you come by Hollis' with me?
          Shake off the adrenaline.

          LAURIE
          No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for
          one night.
          (walking away)
          You take care, Dan. It's a dangerous
          world out there.

          INT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Hollis opens the door for Dan--

          HOLLIS
          You're late.

          DAN
          I know, you won't believe it--

          HOLLIS
          You missed it--Dr. Manhattan just lost it
          on live TV.

          DAN
          Wait, what?
          Dan turns to the TV, which replays the clip of Dr. Manhattan
          being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

          HOLLIS
          She'll know soon enough. The whole world
          will know.

          INT. CAB (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Laurie rides in back, staring out at the street, calming
          down. The cab stops at a red light; The CABBIE takes outa
          ZIPPO,lights a cigarette. Laurie stares at the FLAME

          INT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO)

          like she stares at the flame here, as Adrian's display
          burns. Laurie glances around as everyone leaves, apologizing
          to Adrian.

          EXT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO)

          Outside Watchmen HQ, Dan's Owl Ship rises out of view.
          Rorschach skulks off into the shadows. Dr. Manhattan and
          Janey Slater get into a Town Car as young Laurie watches from
          around the corner.

          BLAKE (O.S.)
          Laurel? Laurel Jane?
          Startled, Laurie turns. Blake steps out of the shadows.

          BLAKE (CONT'D)
          You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

          LAURIE
          You're the Comedian, right? You were
          pretty cool in there.
          Blake lights a smoke, looks her over.

          BLAKE
          You got your mom's eyes. Even that funny
          little mole.

          LAURIE
          Got another smoke?

          49.

          CONTINUED:

          BLAKE
          She was one of the all-time champion
          beauties, your mom. She talk about me
          much?

          LAURIE
          No. Not really.
          As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover
          the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly.

          SALLY (O.S.)

          TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER.
          Laurie nearly jumps out of her skin. A younger Sally marches
          toward them from a LIMO, waiting at the sidewalk.

          BLAKE
          Hey Doll. Long time no see.

          SALLY
          Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
          She eyes Laurie with cool death.

          SALLY (CONT'D)
          Put that out. Get in the car.
          INSIDE THE LIMO: Laurie cracks her window an inch. Her
          mother's harsh, low tone drifts clearly back.

          SALLY (CONT'D)
          Are there no depths you won't sink to?

          BLAKE
          Christ, we were just talking! Can't a guy
          talk to his, y'know, friend's daughter?
          What the hell do you think I am?

          SALLY
          I know what you are, Eddie. I've always
          known. Don't ever forget that.
          Driving off, Laurie watches Blake through the window--

          INT. CAB (STOPPED) - NIGHT

          --like she watches through the window in the present. The
          light turns green--
          --when a BLACK SUV pulls in front of the cab, BLOCKING its
          path.

          CONTINUED:
          The Cabbie honks his horn as a team of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
          get out of the SUV. Agent Forbes knocks on Laurie's window.

          AGENT FORBES
          Ms. Jupiter, you need to come with us now.

          INT. ROCKEFELLER BASE - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

          Agent Forbes escorts her into the room.

          LAURIE
          I don't understand, what do you mean,
          Jon's gone?

          AGENT FORBES
          I mean he snapped and disappeared during
          the interview. Now our trackers can't
          detect him anywhere on the planet. If we
          want to find him you're our only hope.
          A TECHNICIAN wires Laurie up; GRAPHS record Laurie's neural
          responses, MONITORS show satellite images.

          TECHNICIAN 1
          Miss Jupiter, we need you to visualize
          Dr. Manhattan. Do you need a prompt?

          LAURIE
          No.

          TECHNICIAN 2
          Neurotransmissions tracking.

          TECHNICIAN 3
          Transmitting on all frequencies.

          TECHNICIAN 1
          We're ready Miss Jupiter. We need you to
          try and talk to him.
          Laurie, wired like a porcupine, seems embarrassed.

          LAURIE
          Jon? Jon, can you hear me?
          The GRAPH-NEEDLES jump and tick, searching
          . when a high, clear TONE rings through the room.
          Needles fly. Technicians dash to lock it down. Agent Forbes
          hurries to the graph, looking over their shoulders.

          AGENT FORBES
          Have you got him?

          AGENT FORBES
          Well? Where the hell is he?
          The Technician looks up, not happy about the answer.

          TECHNICIAN 1
          He's on Mars.

          EXT. REMOTE SATELLITE STATION - NIGHT

          HUGE DISHES scan the skies. We hear the high, clear tone,
          above all the RADIO CHATTER, NEWS REPORTS and MILITARY
          FREQUENCIES, the endless, echoing chaff of the world...

          NEWS REPORTER 1 (V.0.)
          --massive mobilization of troops in

          KASHMIR--

          NEWS REPORTER 2 (V.0.)

          LAURIE (V.0.)
          Jon. Can you hear me, Jon?
          But these VOICES get progressively QUIETER, as we--
          ZOOM BACK: Up, out of the atmosphere, at a blinding rate--

          EXT. MARS - NIGHT

          --landing on A VAST MARTIAN PLAIN, and the tiny BLUE FIGURE,
          walking across it, RED DUST BILLOWING behind him. The peace
          and quiet after the cacophony of Earth is soothing.
          Dr. Manhattan stops, looking over the landscape. He holds the
          photo of him and Janey Slater in his hand, when he was human.
          He stares at the photo a moment and closes his eyes--
          --and we FLASHBACK to the moment that photo was taken. He and
          Janey are at a CARNIVAL. After the flash, Janey turns to him.

          JANEY SLATER
          Aww, Jon, look--you've got cotton candy

          He pulls her close. They giggle like the young lovers they
          are and then kiss, passionate
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan walking on mars' surface. He
          approaches a LARGE ROCK FORMATION which blocks his path.
          He PARTS the rock formation telekinetically, like Moses
          parting the sea--
          --and we FLASHBACK, mirroring the parting of the rock
          formation to the parting of two SLIDING DOORS, in the LAB OF
          A NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITY, as Jon steps into the REACTOR

          (YELLING)
          I'll catch up with you guys--I left my
          watch inside .
          Jon backs into the chamber without noticing the DIGITAL CLOCK
          above the doors counting down: 3 2 1--"TIME LOCK
          INITIATED"--the doors CLOSE .
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars as he stops to pick up a
          STRANGE ROCK. It's beautiful--the colors, the crystals--
          unlike anything we've ever seen--
          --and we FLASHBACK to Jon's lab COLLEAGUES watching in horror
          as Jon retrieves his WATCH, oblivious. They try to open the
          door, but it's no use--the time lock can't be overridden.
          Janey arrives, SCREAMS when she sees Jon inside. Jon turns,
          sees all the terrified faces staring at him.

          JON OSTERMAN (CONT'D)
          Janey? What's wrong?

          JANEY SLATER
          The time lock, Jon!
          As it dawns on Jon, he hears the hum of the REACTOR
          INITIATING, the big mechanical parts moving. Jon runs to the
          door, BANGS on it.

          JON OSTERMAN
          Janey: Oh my god!
          TEARS stream down Janey's face as she looks at him through

          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he obliterates the strange
          rock he was holding to bits
          and we FLASHBACK to the lab CAFETERIA. Janey sits at a
          table, crying softly, being consoled by her colleagues
          CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE NUCLEAR FACILITY, by the barbed wire
          fences, A DISEMBODIED BRAIN, A SET OF EYES, AND A SPINAL

          COLUMN MATERIALIZES .
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he RISES into the air. At
          a thought, the RED SAND FUSES into a beautiful, PINK GLASS

          STRUCTURE--
          --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria KITCHEN as a COOK SHRIEKS
          at A WALKING NETWORK OF HUMAN VEINS--
          BACK TO: The pink glass structure on Mars which SPREADS OUT
          INTO COMPLEX GLASS PATTERNS, RISING FROM THE PLAIN at Dr.
          Manhattan's command--
          --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria HALLWAY as a SKELETON
          passes two terrified GUARDS
          BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan, now dwarfed by the RISING, EVOLVING
          GLASS STRUCTURE, which begins to resemble parts of a WATCH--
          --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria. Janey's still crying.
          One of her Colleagues reaches for her hand when STATIC SPARKS
          snap around them. All over the cafeteria, the METAL UTENSILS
          begin to SPARK. In the center of the room, GLOWING BLUE
          PARTICLES begin to collect, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER with
          amazing force
          and in a BLINDING FLASH, THE PARTICLES FORM DR.
          MANHATTAN, hovering over the room like a newborn god.
          Everyone in the cafeteria looks up in awe, in fear and--

          JANEY SLATER
          Oh god . Jon is that you?

          PULL OUT FROM: A SATELLITE IMAGE of MARS. NOISE filters back
          in, as TECHNICIANS buzz this way and that, desperate.

          AGENT FORBES
          There must be some way to contact him.
          Laurie sits in the room, largely forgotten.

          LAURIE
          Agent Forbes.

          AGENT FORBES
          (distracted, annoyed)
          What?

          LAURIE
          I need to go to the bathroom.
          Agent Forbes gives her a look, then waves for a SECRET
          SERVICE AGENT to escort her.

          INT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Laurie heads to the bathroom, trailed by the Secret Service
          Agent. As she reaches the bathroom door--
          --she suddenly SPINS and ELBOWS the agent in the GROIN. The
          Agent buckles; Laurie grabs him by his coat, SHOVES his head
          through the bathroom door and SLAMS THE DOOR on his head.

          INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Laurie drags the groggy Agent into the bathroom. She takes
          his GUN, pulls it on him.

          LAURIE
          You're getting me out of here.

          SECRET SERVICE AGENT
          We're only detaining you for national
          security purposes. Don't you understand?

          LAURIE
          Don't you understand that sitting there
          with a bunch of high tech radios and
          monitors isn't going to bring him back?

          Only one thing can bring ion back and
          that's Jon. If he wants to find me, he's
          quite capable of doing so on his own.
          I've been a prisoner in my live long
          enough. You are taking me out of here
          because if you don't, and Jon does come
          back, I'm going to let him know who was
          naughty and who was nice. And he won't
          give you a lump of coal--he'll turn you

          The Agent eyes her, then reluctantly gets to his feet.

          Dan sleeps peacefully in his bed when a SHADOW moves over Dan
          . dropping a NEWSPAPER on his LAP, waking Dan with a
          gasp. Rorschach hovers beside the bed.

          DAN
          Jesus! Rorschach

          RORSCHACH
          Good morning, Daniel. I brought in your
          paper.
          Dan reads the headline: "DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH."

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          The Comedian murdered. Dr. Manhattan
          exiled. Two of us gone within a week.
          Who's next? Veidt? Ms. Jupiter? Me? You?
          Rorschach turns for the door as Dan reads the story.

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          By the way, that new lock broke after one
          shove.

          DAN
          My new lock?

          RORSCHACH
          Get a stronger one, Daniel. You can't be
          too security conscious these days.

          SECRETARY OF STATE
          The Chinese have already made their move.
          India and Pakistan have engaged and
          everyone in the Middle East is going at
          Israel. Time to start picking sides, Mr.
          President.

          PRESIDENT
          Forget picking sides--first, are we safe?

          SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY
          We've increased security at all entry
          points: water ports, airports and border
          patrol.

          PRESIDENT
          I want the National Guard put on the
          border. As for the rest of it . let's

          I know. I'm meeting the toy people, yes?

          ASSISTANT
          Eleven-thirty. They want to talk to you
          about some new villains for the
          "Ozymandias" line.

          ADRIAN
          All the old villains are dead.

          ASSISTANT
          What's with everybody today? Everyone's
          on this death trip.

          ADRIAN
          I suppose the threat of war has that
          effect.
          ACROSS THE WAY, Dan enters the building, intercepts Adrian.

          DAN
          Adrian, I need to talk to you.
          Adrian looks put off.

          ADRIAN
          Dan, I'm sorry, this is a bad time.

          DAN
          But what about what happened with ion?
          Adrian excuses himself from his Assistant.

          ADRIAN
          Jon's departure is terrible. Not only for
          what's happening in the world now, but
          for what could have happened. The energy
          project he and I were working on--it's
          dead now .

          DAN
          Rorschach came to see me again. Maybe
          there's something to this mask killer
          thing.

          ADRIAN
          Are you still preoccupied with the
          ramblings of that lunatic? I really don't
          have time for this, Dan.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          Adrian walks away, continuing on with his Assistant
          when a MAN in a TRENCHCOAT approaches the pair. He DRAWS A
          GUN on them .

          PERSONAL ASSISTANT
          Sometimes I can't bear to watch the news.
          It makes it so hard to be
          optimistic Is that a gun?
          Dan sees what's happening--

          DAN
          Adrian!
          BANG! The man SHOOTS the Assistant in the gut; Adrian
          immediately springs into action--he moves with unbelievable
          speed and quickness, grabbing a velvet ROPE-STANCHION--
          --DEFLECTING A SECOND BULLET with it--
          --and SMASHING IT INTO THE FACE OF THE ASSASSIN, knocking him
          into a FOUNTAIN.
          SECURITY GUARDS run, guns drawn, toward the fountain where
          Adrian GRAPPLES with the dazed man.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Mr. Veidt! Let us handle it!

          ADRIAN
          Wait, he's got a poison capsule!
          He JAMS his fingers into the Assassin's mouth when Dan
          arrives.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Don't bite down, you scum! I want to know
          who sent you!
          The Assassin's eyes BULGE

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          I want to know who's behind this!
          The Assassin CHOKES and dies. Adrian DROPS him,
          unanswered. He looks over at Dan, frustrated.

          INT. CAFE - AFTERNOON

          DAN
          Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still
          in great shape. You get so caught up with
          the whole smartest man in the world thing
          you forget what a physical specimen he is-
          -he's as fast as I've ever seen him

          (BEAT)
          What about you? What are you going to do?

          LAURIE
          I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom-
          -I'm sure that's the first place they'll
          look. But I need to get out of the city.
          It's only a matter of time before they
          find me.

          DAN
          Listen, why don't you . how about you
          stay at my place?

          LAURIE
          Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose--

          DAN
          It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an
          extra room. We're friends. And with
          everything that's been happening

          LAURIE
          You're buying into Rorschach's "mask
          killer" theory?

          DAN
          I don't know. But it can't hurt to be
          safe. Besides, I've already had one
          wanted person visit me, another one won't
          make a difference.
          They look at each other. Laurie smiles.

          Rorschach investigates the apartment of ROY CHESS, Adrian's
          would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy.
          Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch
          nearby, a pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches
          into the pockets. He pulls out some cash, credit cards--
          --and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It says Chess was a
          security guard
          . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw
          at Moloch's house. From Pyramid Industries.
          Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The
          computer is on and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries.
          Rorschach navigates the server until he finds the EMPLOYEE

          DIRECTORY.
          Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types
          in a name: "Jane Slater."
          A photo of Janey Slater pops up--"Status: RETIRED."
          Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at the connection.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          We're in Rorschach's POV as he walks down the street. From
          the non-reaction of passers by, he obviously doesn't have his
          mask on.

          RORSCHACH (V.O.)
          Rorschach's Journal, October 19th.
          Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt.
          Proves mask killer theory--the murderer
          is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the
          key.
          Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and
          finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads:
          "Tonight 11:30, M."

           RORSCHACH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Checked mail drop, got a message from
          Moloch. Was just going to pay him a
          visit.
          Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He
          reaches behind the dumpster.

          Rorschach pulls his mask on, FILLING THE SCREEN

          INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S EYES staring fearfully out the rainy
          window. Rorschach APPEARS in the darkness behind him.

          RORSCHACH
          Somebody tried to shoot the world's
          smartest man today, Moloch.
          Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An
          ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE.

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries.
          So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr.
          Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And
          last time I was here, I saw a pension
          check sent to you from the same company--
          obviously a front set up by whoever it is
          that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr.
          Manhattan over the edge, that wants us
          masks dead. Is that why you left me a
          note in my mail drop? You have something
          to confess?
          Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes.
          A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead.
          Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's
          the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one
          that reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU."
          Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW.

          cupboards, pulling items off the shelves.

          SWAT COP 1
          It's a bum tip, I'm telling you.

          SWAT COP 2-
          Keep your eyes open.
          SWAT Cop 1 moves down the hall, carelessly ahead of formation-
          --BEHIND HIM, Rorschach APPEARS out of the darkness. He
          IGNITES the AEROSOL CAN'S STREAM, SPRAYING THE COPS WITH
          FIRE. They fall back, screaming, shooting. SWAT Cop 1 catches
          the worst of it--he DROPS AND ROLLS on the floor, trying to
          extinguish the flames on him.
          Rorschach BOLTS upstairs, IGNITING the staircase behind him.
          Pandemonium.

          Stay calm, the file says he never goes

          Rorschach APPEARS, blowing PEPPER INTO COP 2'S EYES.

          Det. Gallagher and Fine watch from behind a LINE OF COP CARS.
          The house is now BLAZING. Smoke and men's screams drift out.

          DET. FINE
          We've got him. There's no way out.
          From the second floor, Rorschach SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW,
          snarling like a rabid dog, landing hard on the concrete. His
          ankle TWISTS, dropping him to the ground.
          Rorschach struggles to get to his feet. When he looks up he
          finds TWENTY COPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE before him. A loaded,
          pregnant pause. The COPS RUSH FORWARD.

          unsure what this lunatic will do next.

          RORSCHACH
          Ten years. I've waited for this.
          He beckons them forward. The cops PILE INTO HIM. Rorschach
          brutally disables six cops before he is overwhelmed.

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          No pain. Must get up. Find who framed me--
          A Cop KICKS HIM in the throat. Rorschach drops again.

          FINE
          Get that mask off him!

          COP 1
          I got it. Christ, he stinks!

          No no no NO NO NO!
          The Cop peels back the shifting mask to reveal the Homeless
          Man from the news stand. He screams at them wildly.

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          My face! Give it back to me!
          Rorschach is finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch's
          house blazes in the background.

          What time is it?

          DAN
          Noon. Thought I'd let you sleep in.
          Laurie smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark?

          ANCHORWOMAN
          Today, police searched the apartment of
          Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked
          vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs was captured
          last night and charged with the murder of
          Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the
          supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found
          shot in the head at point blank range.
          Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on
          the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES.

          ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D)
          Inside the decrepit apartment, police
          discovered stacks of right-wing
          literature, including several years of
          back issues of the ultra-conservative
          publication, "The New Frontiersman." We
          asked "New Frontiersman" editor, Hector
          Godfrey, for comment.
          CUT TO: A clip of the EDITOR being interviewed. We see
          Seymour, who we met at the news stand, in the background.

          EDITOR
          Rorschach is an American patriot and we
          are proud that he reads this publication.

          ANCHORWOMAN
          During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and
          severely injured at least nine police
          officers, shooting one officer with a
          grappling gun. That officer is in serious
          but stable condition.

          ANCHORMAN
          Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues
          to intensify. Both India and Pakistan
          alluded that the use of nuclear weapons
          is not out of the question--
          Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk.

          LAURIE
          That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains
          away.

          DAN
          He wasn't always like that. We were a
          great team--tactically, he was brilliant.
          But I don't know, something about this
          murder charge I just can't see
          Rorschach shooting Moloch.

          DAN
          Don't remind me, I made that thing for
          him. But a regular gun just seems too
          . ordinary

          LAURIE
          And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I
          could just leave the planet. Like Jon.

          DAN
          Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer.

          LAURIE
          Now, that's funny. That's what you call
          Jon's teleportation?

          DAN
          Well, not to his face.
          Laurie laughs.

          INT. PRISON HALLS - DAY

          Rorschach walks, led by TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. From the
          cells, PRISONERS shout insults, death threats. Rorschach
          stares ahead. Silent. Calm.

          INT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY

          The PRISON PSYCHIATRIST, Black, amiable, a mite portly, sits
          across the table from Rorschach sans mask: Cold and
          frightening. The Psychiatrist reads his FILE.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          Walter Kovacs. Is that your name?
          Walter?

          RORSCHACH
          No.
          The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          Let me explain your situation here,
          Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may
          be able to convince them that you should
          to be treated medically, in a hospital,
          which I believe is best for you. But the
          authorities want to put you in General
          Population.

          Yes, but the difference is, downstairs?
          They'll eat you alive.
          He holds up a RORSCHACH BLOT-CARD.

           PSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D)
          Now . . tell me what you see.
          FLASH OF: A DEAD DOG. Bloody, horrible.

          RORSCHACH
          A pretty butterfly.
          The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          How about this one? What do you see here?
          FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER,
          HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When
          she catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the
          face. Shuts the door on him.

          RORSCHACH
          Some nice flowers.
          The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card.
          FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER
          BOYS, teasing him. Calling him "son of a whore." Rorschach
          just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his
          face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy
          like a wild animal--biting, clawing .

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          Clouds.
          The Psychiatrist sighs, puts the cards down.

          PSYCHIATRIST
          Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do
          that?

          RORSCHACH
          Why are you here with me, doctor?

          about Rorschach, doctor? I'll tell you
          about Rorschach

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

           Rorschach, walks through intermittent STREETLIGHTS. In his
           GLOVE, he holds a PHOTO of an angelic SIX YEAR OLD GIRL.

           RORSCHACH (V.0.)
           I was investigating a kidnap case. Blair
          Roche, 6 year old girl. I was young then.
          Too soft on criminals. I let them live.

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          A creepy, deserted-looking house. Rorschach peers through a
          slatted fence at TWO GERMAN SHEPHERDS FIGHTING.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to
          the missing girl's location.

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          CRACK! The front door is KICKED OPEN, smashing the lock.
          Rorschach moves between a line of headless MANNEQUINS. In one
          corner rests an old WOOD-BURNING STOVE. Rorschach peers
          inside, removes a BLACKENED scrap of UNDERWEAR. It's
          decorated with little hearts and bears.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          I knew the girl was here. But when I
          searched the place I found nothing.

          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          Rorschach enters the kitchen. Out the window, the DOGS are
          fighting. Rorschach opens a cupboard, where a line of KNIVES,
          CLEAVERS and a HACKSAW hang on hooks. Outside, the snarling
          dogs get LOUDER.
          Slowly now, Rorschach's gaze moves from the knives . to
          the counter. He runs his gloved finger along RED STAINED,
          DEEP-CUT GROOVES in a THICK WOODEN CHOPPING BLOCK. Blood. His
          gaze continues out the window

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          And then I found her.

          . to the dogs, still fighting over the BONE, which we now
          recognize as a small, HUMAN FEMUR--that of the little girl.
          Rorschach clenches his hands in fury, his fists tremble
          and suddenly, he relaxes. Calms.
          Rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard. He reaches for a
          large CLEAVER .

          EXT. HOUSE - LATER (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          The CHILD MOLESTER, greasy and fat, walks past the now-silent
          fence.

           RORSCHACH (V.0.)
           It was dark when the murderer got back.
           As dark as it gets.

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

           The Man flicks a LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. He draws a GUN.

           INT. HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)

          He tries the light in here. Nothing again. He turns away as
          the BODY of a DEAD GERMAN SHEPARD CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW!
          He SCRAMBLES through the warehouse, falling over mannequins.
          He FIRES madly into the dark. The SECOND DOG SMASHES INTO HIM
          FROM A SECOND WINDOW. His gun goes flying. He scrambles
          backward against the stove.
          FROM BEHIND, Rorschach CUFFS THE MAN'S WRIST TO THE STOVE.
          When the Child Molester sees that "face," he loses his
          bladder. Rorschach just stares, mask-blots shifting

          CHILD MOLESTER
          You think I had something to do with that
          girl? I didn't! Where's your evidence?
          Rorschach calmly points to body of the dog. (It is the
          same image Rorschach saw in the first blot-card.)

          CHILD MOLESTER (CONT'D)
          Okay, I confess! I kidnapped her! I
          killed her! Arrest me!

          RORSCHACH

          The Psychiatrist listens, paralyzed. Horrified.

          RORSCHACH
          A tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm
          blood splashed my face. It was Walter
          Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes--
          it was Rorschach who opened them again.
          The silence reels out
          RORSCHACH (cont'd)
          You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that
          little girl, fate didn't butcher her and
          destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If
          God saw what any of us did that night, he
          didn't seem to mind. From then on, I
          knew. God doesn't make the world this
          way. We do.
          The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.

          I can't help him.

          INT. PRISON COMMISSARY - EVENING

          The Mess hall is PACKED, hundreds of INMATES eat dinner.
          Rorschach enters. The place goes instantly, heavily SILENT.
          Suddenly someone yells:

          RANDOM VOICE
          Hey Rorschach, I heard your momma was a
          whore!
          A cruel RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER and the mass conversation begins
          again as Rorschach takes his place in the food line. A HUGE
          PRISONER moves in behind him. He whispers:

          PRISONER
          Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous,
          right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too.
          Maybe I can give you my autograph.
          The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve

          Rorschach doesn't register this. He waits for the FRY-COOK
          behind the counter to turn away--
          --then casually reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER
          BASKET from its mount--
          --the Prisoner JABS the shiv forward--Rorschach spins,
          GRIPPING the man's wrist and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO
          THE MAN'S FACE. The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and
          CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach.
          Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's
          screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once
          again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes
          of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks,
          his icy voice carrying easily.

          RORSCHACH
          None of you understand. I'm not locked up
          in here with you.
          Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          You're locked up in here with me.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER -.EVENING

          CLOSE ON: THE NITE-OWL UNIFORM, staring its blank, empty
          stare. Laurie stares back, alone down here, fascinated with
          the costume, the gadgets, the whole place. She wanders to the
          OWL-SHIP, whose tarp has been pulled back. She runs her
          finger through the DUST caked on the windshield.

          Inside the ship, Laurie pulls open a HATCH filled with

          Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's
          pretty resilient.

          LAURIE
          Archie?

          DAN

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Short for Archimedes--Merlin's owl. I'm
          just glad you're okay. I heard you scream
          and well, you know, after the Comedian--

          LAURIE
          Still with the mask-killer theory?
          Rorschach is insane.

          DAN
          Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon
          exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian;
          Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me
          uneasy.

          73.

          CONTINUED:
          Dan goes to a BANK OF SWITCHES on the wall. Flicking them,
          the Owl-Chamber LIGHTS UP. Hidden FANS dissipate the smoke.

          LAURIE
          How did you ever afford all this?

          DAN
          My Dad was in corporate banking. He left
          me quite a bit. Which always surprised
          me.

          LAURIE
          How did he die?

          DAN
          Mugging. He was shot.
          As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him
          for the first time.

          LAURIE
          You really do worry about me, don't you?

          DAN
          Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about
          you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends--
          Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what
          Dan's been wanting all this time . but he pulls away.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I

          LAURIE
          What's wrong?
          But Dan is already walking up the stairs, pathetic. Laurie's
          left there, alone. The Owl-Costume looming in the background.

          INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

          Rorschach sits in his cell, staring impassively at the wall.

          BIG FIGURE (O.S.)
          It's been a long time, Rorschach.
          Rorschach turns to see TWO THUGS standing side by side, one
          muscle bound, the other very fat, staring at him through the
          bars. PAN DOWN: To reveal a MIDGET between them--the
          supervillain known as the BIG FIGURE--his silver hair combed
          neatly back, a big CIGAR perched in his tiny mouth.

          74.

          CONTINUED:

          RORSCHACH
          Big Figure. Small world.

          BIG FIGURE
          (chuckles through smoke)
          I like that. But you know, it is a small
          world in here. I've been in it for--how
          long now, Billy?

          DUMB THUG
          Twenty years, Mr. Figure.

          BIG FIGURE
          That's right. Twenty years since you and
          that owl fella put me away. Rorschach--
          that guy you burned is dying. Could go
          any minute now. And when he does, this
          place is gonna explode. Then you die by
          inches.

          RORSCHACH
          Tall order.

          FAT THUG
          (SLAMS into the bars)
          I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole!

          BIG FIGURE
          Relax, Lloyd. Soon.
          Chuckling, Big Figure walks off down the long, shadowed
          corridor. Rorschach continues staring, straight ahead.

          INT. DAN'S NIGHTMARE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON: Dan, naked, on his knees in the center of an
          INFINITE FIELD OF BLACKNESS. No corners, no exits. In the
          DISTANCE, he sees a FEMALE FORM. Desperate, he runs to her.
          It's Laurie, waiting for him IN COSTUME. They kiss. She tears
          at him passionately. His SKIN suddenly TEARS AWAY like
          wrapping paper. Beneath the false skin, Dan wears his NITE-
          OWL COSTUME. Confident, he touches her face. She smiles with
          palpable heat. They kiss.
          In the background, a NUCLEAR BLAST ERUPTS. Still kissing, the

          BLAST BLOWS THEM INTO TWO EMBRACING SKELETONS.

          INT. DAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dan wakes with a jolt, sweat beaded on his forehead

          

          

          

          

          75.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The DOOR opens. Laurie stands in the SHAFT OF LIGHT.

          LAURIE
          Dan? Is everything okay? I heard you
          coming down the stairs
          Descending the stairs, she finds Dan before his costume,
          naked. He fiddles with an OWL-WING THROWING WEAPON.

          DAN
          Mask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation.
          I feel so powerless, so I've been
          afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of
          how much I need it.
          He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the dark.

          LAURIE
          So. Let's take the ship out.

          DAN
          What?

          LAURIE
          Who's to know? I used to be a "masked
          avenger" too, remember? I'm used to
          getting up at three in the morning to do
          something stupid. Besides, I'm already a
          wanted lady, you're already in trouble
          for hiding me, how much more trouble can
          we be in? Just give me a second--can't go
          out like this.
          She jogs upstairs. Dan turns to the empty, waiting suit.

          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - LATER

          PAN UP: DAN'S COSTUMED BODY. The Nite Owl suit is fantastic,
          intricate, but above the belly . it just barely fits, Dan
          managing to CLICK it closed.

          DAN
          I can't believe it still fits. Luckily I
          constructed it with material that was
          elastic and--
          Dan turns as Laurie appears at the door, decked in her BLACK
          SPANDEX. SILK SPECTRE, looking every bit as good as seventeen-

          DAN (CONT'D)

          CONTINUED:

          LAURIE
          I'm ready.
          Dan turns and sees his reflection in the owl-Ship's window.

          DAN
          Me too.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Laurie holds on as the Owl-Ship's ENGINES ROAR to life. The
          ship RISES INTO THE AIR and slips easily into the TUNNEL.
          Laurie watches the LIGHTS of the tunnel whiz by. At the end,
          two big STEEL DOORS open, allowing a passage UP.

          DAN
          Let's have some cloud cover.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          THICK FOG POURS FROM LOWER-DECK JETS as the ship RISES into
          an ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, whose steel roof ROLLS BACK.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Laurie touches the window, the SPARKLING CITY laid out below.

          LAURIE
          It's so beautiful

          DAN
          Hang on.
          Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Got to clean her up a bit. I'm sure
          Adrian wouldn't want to impede the course
          of justice.
          Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last
          moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the
          skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of
          dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new.

          LAURIE
          Look!
          Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw
          sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they zoom
          closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          77.

          CONTINUED:

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          There's children in there!

          DAN
          I'm putting the water cannons on the
          lower stories.
          (over the LOUDSPEAKERS)

          PLEASE REMAIN CALM. WE ARE SLOWING THE

          FIRE DOWN FROM BELOW. CALMLY MAKE YOUR

          WAY TO THE ROOF AND I'LL EXTEND A RAMP TO

          YOU.
          (to Laurie)
          Can you escort the people over?
          She watches him move, quick, confident. She smiles.

          LAURIE
          I'm on it. Nite Owl.

          EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          The ship EXTENDS AN ESCAPE RAMP with Laurie on board. The
          residents forget their fear of fire for a moment as they soak
          in the spectacle of this sexy lady on this Owl-Ship.

          LAURIE
          Hi. If you could all form a line, we'll
          have you out of here in just a moment.
          ATOP THE SHIP: Dan latches the steering column into its roof
          socket. He stands; Takes a deep, chest-expanding breath. Who
          has he been kidding? This is who he is. Flicking a switch OLD
          JAZZ plays pleasantly.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - NIGHT

          Below, the residents file on board, in a daze at their
          surroundings. Laurie grins at the music.

          LAURIE
          Anybody want coffee?

          EXT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          FIRE rising behind, Dan wings the ship STRAIGHT INTO FRAME.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          The Owl-Ship RISES, leaving a grateful CROWD behind. In the
          background FIRE TRUCKS are just arriving. A FIREFIGHTER looks
          up in time to see the Owl-Ship disappear into the clouds.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Dan skims the clouds like a man waking from a dream.

          LAURIE
          I can't believe we did that! That was
          actually fun

          DAN
          Yeah.
          He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He
          knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it
          He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they
          slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - LATER

          Soft music plays. Dan and Laurie lie in a heap of discarded
          costumes.

          LAURIE
          It was good, wasn't it?

          DAN
          Yeah, saving those people from the fire.
          Taking Archie out
          Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan
          grins, having fun with her.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          It--you were unbelievable.
          They kiss.

          LAURIE
          So . what do we do next?
          Dan sits up, serious. Very serious.

          DAN
          I've been thinking about that. And I
          believe we have certain obligations to
          our fraternity.

          (BEAT)
          I think we should spring Rorschach.

          EXT. OWL-SHIP - CONTINUOUS

          Long beat. The ship hovers, silent in the clouds.

          What?

          INT. PRISON MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT

          The Prisoner Rorschach burned lies in bed, his face
          completely bandaged, hooked to an IV . . when he FLATLINES.

          INT. RORSCHACH'S PRISON CELL - NIGHT

          Down the dark corridors, a ROAR is building. ALARMS ring. Big
          Figure and his two Thugs appear at the door.

          BIG FIGURE
          He's dead, Rorschach--the riot's already
          begun. While everyone's distracted, we
          thought we'd bring you a housewarming
          gift. Something from the machine shop.
          The Fat Thug wheels an ELECTRICAL WELDER to the door.
          Rorschach sits, idly TEARING his PRISON SHIRT into STRIPS.

          FAT THUG
          Hey Boss, y'notice? None of that "small
          world, tall order" crap, cuz he knows
          once we slice open this lock, he's next
          on the block.

          RORSCHACH
          Fat chance.
          The Fat Thug reddens. He DIVES forward, HANDS SWIPING for
          Rorschach.

          FAT THUG
          You're dead, Rorschach! We got a prison
          full of killers out here! What've you
          got?
          Rorschach SPINS, WRAPPING A SHIRT-STRIP AROUND HIS WRISTS,
          trapping the Fat Thug's hands inside the cell.

          RORSCHACH
          Your hands. My pleasure.
          Rorschach SNAPS Fat Thug's pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS.
          Rorschach roughly binds the fingers around the bars.
          Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat Thug's body.

          DUMB THUG
          I can't reach the lock. Should I cut the
          bars?

          This riot won't last. And I've been
          waiting twenty years for this
          Big Figure nods to the Dumb Thug, who then grabs Fat Thug's
          neck.

          DUMB THUG
          Nothing personal, big guy.

          FAT THUG
          Boss, you can't be serious! Wait--
          Dumb Thug SNAPS Fat Thug's neck. He then CUTS OFF Fat Thug's
          hands with the welder, pushes the corpse out of the way to
          reach the lock. Big Figure grins at Rorschach.

          BIG FIGURE
          Now you find out what the score is.

          RORSCHACH
          One-nothing. Come and get me.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Dan and Laurie are back in costume.

          LAURIE
          Look, Dan, I'm glad you were able to
          rediscover your calling in life, but I
          think you're getting carried away. You're
          talking about springing a homicidal
          psychopath from prison.

          DAN
          Rorschach may be sick, but I think he's
          on to something--four heroes attacked in
          a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that
          whole cancer thing with ion, does that
          make sense to you? You didn't contract
          cancer from him.
          He says as Laurie's about to light a cigarette. She changes
          her mind.

          LAURIE
          Why would someone want to drive ion away?
          Look what's happening now. With Jon gone
          it looks like we're headed for another
          World War. Who would want that?

          HELIPAD. On the helipad is a HELICOPTER with the Veidt
          Enterprises LOGO.

          DAN
          I don't know. But I know someone who
          might be able to help.
          Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof.

          INT. ADRIAN'S MANSION - NIGHT

          Surprisingly, Adrian is awake, packing his things, hustling
          about his grand mansion as Dan and Laurie trail.

          DAN
          You're leaving town? So you do believe
          Rorschach's theory.

          ADRIAN
          Please. Right now, I'm not concerned with
          this so-called mask-killer, I'm concerned
          with the mass killer called war, or have
          you not heard.
          (calling out)
          On !
          A WALL SIZED MIRROR turns into a TV:

          CNN NEWSCASTER
          --US Aircraft Carriers have already moved
          into the Persian Gulf and US Battleships
          have left Japan en route to the Far East

          THEATRE--

          LAURIE
          It's happening
          Dan breaks away from the terrible news, follows Adrian.

          DAN
          All the more reason we need to get to the
          bottom of this. Maybe we can get Jon to
          come back in the process and stop all
          this madness.

          ADRIAN
          Nothing we do will bring Jon back!
          (glances at Laurie)
          But I think you know that already. And
          breaking Rorschach out of prison
          certainly isn't the answer.

          CONTINUED:

          DAN
          Rorschach's been the only one
          investigating this from the start.
          Without him, we're starting at the
          beginning and we don't have that kind of
          time. We need your help, Adrian.

          ADRIAN
          I'm leaving, Dan. And I suggest you both
          do the same.
          Adrian pulls on a thick WINTER COAT and heads upstairs.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT

          Adrian walks briskly to his idling COPTER, propellers loudly
          cutting through the air. Dan gives one last effort, shouting.

          DAN
          Where are you going to go?

          ADRIAN
          Antarctica.
          It takes Dan a moment to realize Adrian is serious. By then,
          Adrian's halfway into the helicopter.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Good luck, Dan.
          He says it sincerely. Dan watches the helicopter fly off.

          INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

          Dumb Thug WELDS, the lock GLOWS RED. Nearly through.
          Rorschach backs away from the door as Big Figure trembles in
          excitement.

          Hurry Lloyd! I wanna smell this
          sonofabitch cooking!
          The lock MELTS AWAY. Rorschach climbs onto his bunk as Dumb
          Thug enters, JABBING the electric welder at him menacingly.
          Rorschach drives his HEEL into the porcelain TOILET BOWL,
          SHATTERING IT. WATER SPILLS across the floor. Rorschach KICKS
          Dumb Thug in the stomach; Dumb Thug buckles, then SLIPS in
          the water--Dumb Thug falls, welder still in hand as he hits
          the water
          Dumb Thug's hand FUSES to the welder as ELECTRICITY SURGES
          THROUGH HIM. He collapses, smoking. Dead.

          Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a
          toilet before. Obvious, really.
          Big Figure looks very small and alone now

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          Two-nothing. Your move.
          Panic stricken, Big Figure moves, or rather, runs. Rorschach
          calmly follows him out of the cell.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT

          The Owl-Ship tears through the sky, the prison ahead on the
          horizon. Dan has his game face on; Laurie's still unsure.

          DAN
          You don't have to do this. I know the
          whole crimefighting thing wasn't
          necessarily your choice in life.

          LAURIE
          No. But this is.
          She moves next to him.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          But I'm not doing it for Rorschach or
          even for Jon. And I'm sure as hell not
          doing if for the Comedian.
          They look at each other--Dan knows who she's doing it for.
          The Owl-Ship is upon the prison now

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          Look!
          They see a RIOT below--Inmates spilling out into the yard,
          overwhelming the Correctional Officers on the ground; TOWER
          GUARDS take shots at some of the Inmates; Broken glass,
          broken furniture parts scattered through the yard; SMOKE
          emits from inside the prison.

          DAN
          Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and
          suddenly there's a riot. I wonder if
          that's a coincidence.
          They descend toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE.
          The Tower Guards, stunned at the sight of the Owl-Ship, begin
          SHOOTING at it. The bullets bounce right off.

          The ship emits a PIERCING SHRIEK. WINDOWS SHATTER. The
          Inmates and Guards fall to the ground in sonic agony.

          LAURIE
          How are we going to find Rorschach in all
          of this?

          DAN
          When he and I were partners, we each had
          tracking implants put under our skin so
          old Archie here could find us if either
          one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see
          if Rorschach kept his in.
          Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          He's in that wing.
          Dan steers the ship toward the Maximum Security Wing. 9

          EXT. PRISON - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - CONTINUOUS

          The Owl-Ship stops to a hover position. The LOWER HATCH OPENS
          and a LADDER extends
          As Laurie descends the ladder, Dan simply, joyously LEAPS
          OUT, his wings SNAP WIDE to GLIDE him through the air.

          INT. PRISON HALLS - NIGHT

          Fires burn in the cells. Shotguns and screams echo in the
          emergency lighting. Archie's Owl-Shriek is dulled here--it's
          quiet. Tense.
          Laurie and Dan turn the corner, searching. Laurie spots the
          BODY of a DEAD GUARD. She crouches to take his PISTOL, slips
          it into her waistband.

          LAURIE
          How do we know he's still alive?
          They come upon Rorschach's cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE
          of Dumb Thug. Sees the CUT OFF HANDS of Fat Thug, HANGING
          from the bars.

          Big Figure runs, turns a corner, ducking into the BATHROOM.
          Rorschach sees this and walks serenely after him . when
          Dan and Laurie enter the far hall.

          LAURIE
          Is that--

          DAN
          Rorschach? Rorschach!

          RORSCHACH
          Hello, Daniel, Ms. Jupiter. Excuse me, I
          just have to visit the men's room.
          He disappears into the dark bathroom. Laurie watches after
          him in stunned disbelief.

          LAURIE
          Oh, for Christ's sake.

          DAN
          Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big
          arrest like that once. Had to redesign
          the costume after that--
          Rorschach exits the bathroom, wiping his hands.

          RORSCHACH
          We can leave now.
          He walks off.

          LAURIE
          Are you sure you're ready? We don't want
          to go diving head-first into things.

          RORSCHACH
          Good Advice. I'm sure there are many
          who'd agree with you.
          Behind them: BLOODY WATER FLOODS from the bathroom door as
          they go.

          LAURIE
          I'm not.

          RORSCHACH
          Of course you haven't been attacked yet.
          Funny, most everyone else has.

          LAURIE
          What's that supposed to mean? We came
          here to rescue you, asshole!

          DAN
          Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to
          turn the screechers off, so we'll be
          drawing fire.
          The owl-Ship rises to the roof. They all jump in.

          EXT. PRISON - NIGHT

          Under HEAVY FIRE the Owl-Ship ZOOMS OFF, leaving the chaos
          behind.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) NIGHT

          Dan weaves and whips the ship into the sky, above the clouds.
          Satisfied that they've escaped, Dan allows himself a grin. He
          looks at Laurie, who grins back.

          DAN
          Rorschach, you remember how to handle
          Archie?

          RORSCHACH
          I believe so.
          Rorschach sits in the pilot's seat. Dan turns to Laurie, high
          on adrenaline and love. Dan moves in to kiss her--

          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
          Daniel.

          SHIP.

          LAURIE
          It `s him.
          The ship COLLIDES with Dr. Manhattan, who PASSES THROUGH into
          the CABIN with a SHOWER of BLUE PARTICLES--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Hello Laurie.

          LAURIE
          They said you were on Mars.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I am on Mars. You and I are about to have
          a conversation there.

          LAURIE
          Where? What are you talking about?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You are going to try to convince me to
          save the world.

          DAN
          Wait, what? You're taking her to Mars?
          No, she can't--Laurie, I don't know about

          LAURIE
          I have to go, Dan. Jon and I, we're going
          to talk. Maybe we'll find some way out of

          J--huc? Hhhhhhh--
          Laurie GRIPS her throat and TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls
          into Jon, waiting for her at the bottom. She CLAWS at him.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Oh. Forgive me. These things sometimes
          slip my mind.
          He TOUCHES her mouth, forming a small ATMOSPHERE around her.
          She HEAVES in air, retching and choking at the same time.

          Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the
          Empire State Building . but the copter's still there.
          Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter

          Hollis hangs up, heads to the door, excited. He opens the

          DOOR--
          --and the Gang Members PILE INTO HIM. The picture SLOWS DOWN.
          Hollis turns, mouth bleeding. HOLLIS' POV IS SEPIA TONED. The
          gang appears as a COLLECTION of VILLAINS in COSTUMES.

          You . know about me and Dan?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Not yet. But in a few moments, you're
          going to tell me.

          LAURIE
          Jon, I'm having enough problems right now
          without getting into your predestination
          crap.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Why does my perception of time distress
          you so?

          LAURIE
          Because. If you already know the future,
          why were you surprised when I left you,
          or when that reporter ambushed you? Why
          even debate if you already know the
          outcome?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Because everything is pre-ordained. Even
          my responses.

          LAURIE
          Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you
          know what a relief it is to be with
          somebody human, like Dan?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          You mean you're sleeping with Dan
          Dreiberg?
          Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony's edge.

          LAURIE
          But you already know . You said--

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I said, often, that you were my only
          remaining link with the world. Now that
          link is shattered. Don't you see the
          futility of asking me to save a world
          that I no longer have any stake in?

          LAURIE
          That's ridiculous. The Earth is too
          important to hinge on one relationship.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Not to me. My red world here means more
          to me than your blue one. I'll show you
          around if you like.
          The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE.

          LAURIE
          Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood
          for jokes.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand the
          gravity of the situation.
          The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO THE AIR

          EXT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - NIGHT

          The Owl-Ship approaches the large warehouse building that is
          Pyramid Industries. The ship lands in the alley nearby.
          Dan and Rorschach exit the ship. Shady neighborhood.
          Rorschach goes to the door which is AJAR

          INT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Dan and Rorschach slowly make their way down, peering into
          ROOMS. The place looks abandoned--scattered papers, dusty
          file cabinets, leftover computer components

          RORSCHACH
          You sure this is the correct location,
          Daniel?

          DAN
          Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes
          in industrial plastics. At least they
          did.

          INT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT

          They enter the large, dark industrial section of the
          building. They pass huge PROCESSING VATS, CONVEYOR BELTS.

          DAN
          I tapped into all the databases--tax
          records, business registries, real estate
          records--trying to get a bead on who's
          behind Pyramid but it's a never ending
          paper trail.
          Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT--
          --he turns his FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE
          squatting in the warehouse. Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the
          Homeless People run away.

          RORSCHACH
          Daniel.

          DAN
          They're harmless, Rorschach.

          RORSCHACH
          Daniel.
          Rorschach is looking down at something. Dan heads over and
          sees a DEAD BODY in the early stages of decomposition. He
          turns the body over--bullet between the eyes just like Moloch
          . but we recognize the corpse--it's journalist Doug Roth.

          DAN
          Hey, I know this man.

          RORSCHACH
          Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled
          Dr. Manhattan on national television.

          DAN
          No I didn't watch that interview.
          This was the guy who was doing a story on
          Adrian when I went to see him.

          RORSCHACH
          Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was
          probably working to set up Veidt also.
          Dan stands there thinking. As if hit with an epiphany. He
          opens his mouth like he can't believe what he's going to say.

          DAN
          Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian?

          RORSCHACH
          Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no sense.

          DAN
          On the surface it doesn't, but hear me
          out--Adrian's the only one who could've
          taken on the Comedian in hand to hand
          combat. He's the only one with the
          finances to create an entire company for
          the sole purpose of setting up Dr.
          Manhattan. And Adrian was directly
          involved in arranging that broadcast. He
          probably supplied this journalist with
          the whole cancer list.

          RORSCHACH
          That doesn't explain the attempt on
          Veidt's life.

          DAN
          If we say that Adrian set that up
          himself, he could've had the hitman shoot
          his assistant first. It was a risk, but--

          RORSCHACH
          But why?

          DAN
          I don't know. Let's go ask him.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT

          The endless white blanket that is Antarctica is interrupted
          by a SPLASH OF COLOR in the distance. As we approach, we see
          that the color is a BIO-DOME--a tropical RAINFOREST inside.
          This is part of KARNAK: Adrian Veidt's Arctic Fortress.

          INT. KARNAK - BIO-DOME - NIGHT

          Adrian stands at the entrance of the Bio-Dome, amidst the
          exotic foliage, where a GROUP of SCIENTISTS and ENGINEERS are
          gathered. They all hold CHAMPAGNE FLUTES--Adrian raises his
          glass for a toast when the HEAD SCIENTIST interrupts.

          HEAD SCIENTIST
          Mr. Veidt, may I?

          ADRIAN
          By all means, Eric.

          HEAD SCIENTIST
          I just would like to say that when I was
          first offered this position, I was
          hesitant. A multi-year commitment to work
          in Antarctica?

          But the opportunity to experiment with
          Dr. Manhattan's atomic fusion energy was
          too great for me to pass up, too great
          for any of us to pass up. And now that
          our work is finished, and we finally get
          to go home, I can say that it was all
          worth it. Mr. Veidt, you are a genius.
          The world will be a better place because
          of you.

          ADRIAN
          I certainly hope so.
          The group applauds. Then they sip their champagne. All except
          for Adrian
          The group goes around congratulating each other, when
          suddenly the Head Scientist COLLAPSES, choking. The others
          surround him, trying to help--
          --when one by one they each start collapsing themselves--
          POISONED by the champagne.
          Adrian regards them all, writhing on the floor, and leaves.

          EXT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - NIGHT

          In the alley, the Gang Members who killed Hollis Mason stand
          around the Owl-Ship arguing amongst themselves, when Dan
          appears behind them.

          DAN
          Something I can help you with, boys?
          They all spin around, frightened at the costume.

          GANG MEMBER 1

          I told you we had the wrong guy.
          The Gang Leader shits his pants as Dan steps closer.

          L-listen, I didn't mean to kill that old
          guy. Things just got outta hand

          Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away.

          Not now, Daniel.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING

          The Owl-Ship slows to a hover besides an OLDER BUILDING.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
          Rorschach's Journal. Final entry?
          Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is
          behind everything. Apparently, the Owl-
          Ship is capable of the trip to
          Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine
          a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is
          faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used
          to joke that he was fast enough to catch
          a bullet. I believe he could. He could
          kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one
          would know.
          Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the
          building. He places his JOURNAL in an ENVELOPE.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I have done my best to make this legible.
          Whether I am alive or dead upon this
          reading, know that whatever the nature of
          this conspiracy--Adrian Veldt is
          responsible.
          He drops the envelope into the MAIL SLOT, climbs back up the
          ladder.

          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I appreciate your recent support and hope
          the world survives long enough for this
          to reach you. For my own part, I regret
          nothing. I have lived my life free of
          compromise, and step now into the shadow
          without complaint. Rorschach. October

          LAURIE
          Static?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Tachyon particles. Tachyons are a rare

          You're right, Jon--what does human life
          matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm
          not going to debate you when you clearly
          don't see anything terribly miraculous
          about life. I guess quantum physics
          doesn't allow for miracles.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          No, thermodynamic miracles are--

          Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all
          the other worthless humans. And look, you
          were wrong. You said this ended with me

          life on life's terms. And yet you
          continuously refuse to see things from my
          perspective. If only you'd try to see the

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I tried to explain. Thermodynamic
          miracles--events with odds against so
          astronomical, like oxygen turning into
          gold. I have longed to witness such a
          thing and yet I neglect that in human
          coupling, millions upon millions of cells
          compete to create life over generation
          after generation: Until finally, your
          mother loves a man--Edward Blake, the
          Comedian--a man she has every reason to
          hate. And out of that contradiction,
          against unfathomable odds, it was you,
          only you, that emerged. To distill so
          specific a form from all of that chaos;
          Your creation is like . turning air
          into gold. A miracle.

          LAURIE
          But if my birth is a miracle you, you
          could say that about anyone.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes, anyone in the world. But the world
          is so crowded with miracles that they
          become commonplace and we forget. I
          forget.
          They stand there in silence. Connected for the first time in
          years.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Now. Dry your eyes.
          FROM ABOVE: We see the full CRATER--the ARGYRE PLANITIA.
          Round, with two, eye-like BOULDERS set side by side, a RIDGE
          of land curling below . like a smiley-face.

          DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)(CONT'D)
          And let's go home.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAWN

          The owl-Ship sails through a TOWERING CLOUD BANK. The COAST
          approaches as SNOW starts to fall.

          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - DAWN

          Dan stares ahead, stoic. Thinking about Hollis, Laurie and
          Adrian. He glances at a MONITOR, tracking heat signatures.
          There's a LARGE SIGNAL ahead.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          104.

          CONTINUED:

          DAN
          I've got a large reading ahead. Anything
          that's emitting that much heat out here,
          must be a pretty big facility. Adrian.

          (BEAT)
          We're not going to make it, are we?
          Rorschach says nothing . when a halting WHINE sputters
          from the engines. A HUGE CLIFF APPEARS before them.

          RORSCHACH
          The engines--

          DAN
          They're icing up, hold on!
          Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAWN

          The ship, tiny before the massive ice-wall, climbs slowly.
          It's going to be close. The wall is 100 yards away now, the
          top-most edge barely in view. 50 yards. 20 and then

          SILENCE--

          DAN
          We just lost the engines--find something
          to grab on to!
          The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS
          across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN

          Dan opens the hatch. Shrieking WIND blows the snow in. Dan
          pulls on a white, FUR-LINED SNOW-OWL costume.

          DAN
          The engines are de-icing. You sure I
          can't fit you with something warmer?

          RORSCHACH
          Fine like this.

          EXT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN

          Rorschach pulls up his trench-collar against the bitter wind.
          Dan pulls two stand-up HOVER-SCOOTERS from an OUTSIDE HATCH.
          They exchange a look and ride the scooters off into the snow.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN

          Adrian, dressed in his Ozymandias costume, sits alone in the
          massive hall, opposite a wall of giant PLASMA-SCREENS which
          show various television NEWS CHANNELS showing all the IMAGES

          OF WAR IN THE WORLD.
          Adrian sighs and hits the remote--the screens become ONE
          IMAGE--ALEXANDER THE GREAT slicing the Gordian Knot.
          By Adrian's feet is an exotic LYNX. Its unnatural beauty
          almost hides a feral danger in its eyes. Adrian pets the
          beast.

          ADRIAN
          See this painting? Alexander the Great.
          Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he
          struck North for Gordium, where the
          world's greatest puzzle waited. A great
          knot, impossible to untie. For a young
          man determined to rule the world, it was
          a challenge he couldn't resist. So he
          sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral
          thinking, you see.
          Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          What is it, girl?
          He hits the remote--the TV screens switch to MULTIPLE VIEWS
          OF Dan and Rorschach, heading toward Karnak.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Ah. It's all right, girl. Everything's
          all right.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - SNOWFIELDS - DAWN

          Flying on the scooter, Dan wipes frost and fog from his
          goggles. He then looks up and--
          --sees KARNAK, a GARGANTUAN GLASS PYRAMID, rising out of the
          snow, the Bio-Dome attached to it.

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN

          Adrian watches Dan and Rorschach reach the door on the
          monitors.

          CONTINUED:

          ADRIAN
          Really, getting even this far is an
          admirable effort, given their
          limitations. Of course the ice they're
          skating on is slippery and thinner than
          it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep
          themselves.
          On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          Let's hope they know when to stop.

          INT. KARNAK - DAWN

          Having burnt through the control panel, Dan pushes the huge
          door open. They enter the grand palace, dwarfed by its
          Macedonian massiveness.

          DAN

          JESUS

          (BEAT)
          I don't understand any of this. Adrian's
          a pacifist. He's never killed anyone in
          his life. He's a vegetarian for Christ's
          sake!

          RORSCHACH
          Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're
          squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get
          a second chance.

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN

          Dan and Rorschach pass the wall of plasma screens into--

          INT. DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS

          --the dining hall, where Adrian eats alone, at a long table.
          Though they're only a few yards away, Adrian doesn't appear
          to see them, hidden by some PILLARS.
          Dan and Rorschach signal to each other, quiet. Adrian eats--
          --and Rorschach RUSHES him from behind--
          --Adrian moves at the last second, grabs Rorschach's arm,
          ELBOWS him in the chest, spins and BACKHAND FISTS him,
          sending him flying back.

          ADRIAN
          Mind your manners.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          107.

          CONTINUED:
          Dan draws his PEN-LASER.

          DAN
          Adrian, don't make me--
          Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan
          FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray--
          --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS,
          Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm.

          ADRIAN
          Now. What can I do for you?

          DAN
          You know! You killed the Comedian! You
          set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid
          Industries, hired all those people, gave
          them cancer and blamed it on Jon!

          ADRIAN
          Yes.

          DAN
          Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do?

          ADRIAN
          What we always intended--to improve the
          world.
          As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a
          FORK. He tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian
          effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS
          it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor.
          Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschach up
          and they follow.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          I never intended to kill the Comedian--
          that was an accident. Part of his duties
          as a government operative was to keep
          track of all former masked heroes, make
          sure there was no rocking of the boat. He
          must have liked Rorschach because he
          allowed him to continue to exist. I had
          thought that the Comedian might be
          incompetent, but he disproved that
          hypothesis when he discovered what was
          really going on. here in Karnak--no easy
          task. Even my staff was unaware--I made
          sure to keep each department separate.

           ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but
          still, he understood the scope of what I
          was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I
          never thought he'd actually talk. But by
          the time he visited poor Moloch, he was
          cracking badly. So I had to kill him.

          INT. CONTROL HALL - CONTINUOUS

          As they enter the control hall, Rorschach moves to attack
          Adrian again when he and Dan hear a growl . the Lynx
          steps in between, protecting its master.

          ADRIAN
          After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan
          nearly a decade in the works after
          analyzing confidential psychological
          profiles which predicted his withdrawal
          from human existence. By then,
          Rorschach's mask theory, 'though
          erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I
          faked my own assassination--

          DAN
          Why take that risk? What if the hitman
          shot you first instead of your assistant?

          ADRIAN
          I suppose I'd have to be fast enough to
          catch the bullet then, wouldn't I?
          Adrian smiles enigmatically.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          After apprehending my own assassin, I
          shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth,
          disposing of him, and soon after that,
          the journalist Doug Roth, tying up all
          the loose ends if you will. Then I knew
          nothing stood in the way of my triumph.

          DAN
          Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to
          do?

          ADRIAN
          I'm firing a beam of concentrated energy,
          synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself,
          into the hearts of nine key regions
          around the globe, crossing all
          traditional politics and ideologies;

          Pyongyang, London, Jerusalem, New York--
          destroying approximately three million
          people.

          DAN
          Three million people? You're joking.

          RORSCHACH
          He's not. Listen to his voice.

          DAN
          Rorschach, he's making it up!

          ADRIAN
          I understand your disbelief, Dan. When I
          began the plan ten years ago, my moral
          safeguards gave me pause at the necessary
          sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct.
          What we were doing with the Watchmen was
          pointless--the savage nature of humankind
          would inevitably lead to the end of the
          world. So in order to save the world, I
          had to trick it--to frighten the world
          towards salvation with history's greatest
          practical joke.

          DAN
          By killing millions of people? And when
          were you planning on doing this?

          ADRIAN
          When? Dan, my dear friend, I am the
          smartest man in the world--do you
          seriously think I'd explain my master
          stroke if there remained even the
          slightest chance of you affecting it's
          outcome?

          Laurie drops roughly to her knees.

          Wait, this is Adrian's compound? Are you
          saying he's responsible for this--
          Jon walks toward the building, entranced. Distracted.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of
          others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to
          Laurie ninety seconds ago

          LAURIE
          What, Daniel? Millions of others? Jon
          don't start that crap now, not here!

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're,
          muddling things up. I'd better follow him

          INSIDE
          In a burst, he's gone.

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Jon materializes in the hall. Adrian sprints like lightening,
          out of the room, followed by the Lynx.

          RORSCHACH
          No, don't let him escape!

          DAN
          Jon, stop him, he killed millions of
          people, who knows what else he'll do.
          Jon walks calmly after Adrian.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Jon, are you okay? You seem drugged.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of
          others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to
          Laurie ninety seconds ago

          DAN
          What? Where's Laurie?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're,
          muddling things up. I'd better follow him

          INSIDE
          Jon follows Adrian into the next room.

          INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          Jon enters the MAZE of advanced technology.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Adrian, don't be foolish. Even if I can't
          predict where I'm going to find you, I
          can turn the walls to glass. The tachyons
          were clever but it's time to give up
          Jon spots the Lynx in a METAL CORRIDOR.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Very well. If I must, let us follow this
          through to the bitter end.
          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS is Adrian, waiting by a
          CONTROL PANEL. He takes one last look at his Lynx.

          ADRIAN
          Forgive me, girl.
          Jon enters the corridor with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a
          SWITCH. The Lynx' FUR STANDS ON END as ENERGY CRACKLES
          BETWEEN THE METAL WALLS. The Lynx HOWLS.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Adrian? Adrian, don't--
          LIGHT BLASTS through Jon and the Lynx--both are OBLITERATED.
          Adrian peers around the corner, winded by his success.

          ADRIAN
          You know, I really wasn't sure that would
          work.

          LAURIE (O.S.)

          ADRIAN--
          Adrian turns. Laurie aims the prison guard's pistol at him.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          You're such an asshole.
          Adrian cries out, LEAPS at her as she FIRES--
          --and hits Adrian. He COLLAPSES. Dan and Rorschach find them
          as Laurie approaches Adrian's body

          DAN
          Laurie, shoot him again!
          Adrian's hand falls from his chest to the floor, blood
          trickling, as his PALM OPENS--
          --holding a BULLET inside.

          LAURIE
          Oh shit.
          Adrian opens his eyes and KICKS her in the stomach, sending
          her flying back.

          DAN
          LAURIE! If you've hurt her, I'll--

          ADRIAN
          Oh Dan. Grow up.
          Adrian exits as Dan helps the winded Laurie to her feet.
          Together, Rorschach, Dan and Laurie follow him back to:

          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - MORNING

          Adrian approaches his wall of TV screens when--

          DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)

          I AM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU ADRIAN. VERY

          DISAPPOINTED.
          Jon, now 100 FEET TALL, SMASHES THROUGH THE WALL. Adrian
          crawls desperately away, grasping for his remote on the
          floor. As Jon approaches him, Jon SHRINKS to six feet.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          Restructuring myself was the first trick
          I learned! It didn't kill me before, did
          you seriously think it would kill me now?
          You are nothing but a man. And the
          world's smartest man means no more to me
          than its smartest termite!
          Out of tricks, out of traps, Adrian lifts the remote.

          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
          What is that, Adrian? Some new, ultimate
          weapon?

          ADRIAN
          Yes. Yes, you could say that.
          Adrian goes back to his wall of screens, watching the news
          reports. We hear SOUND BITES and IMAGES: "India and Pakistan
          immediately call for truce," "China stands down," "US
          withdraws forces," "Israel agrees on cease fire."
          TEARS stand in Adrian's eyes. He raises his fists in triumph.

          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
          I did it. I DID IT! I've saved Earth from
          Hell. Next, I will elevate her to the
          vaulting stature of Heaven.

          LAURIE
          Next? You can't get away with this!

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          116.

          CONTINUED:

          ADRIAN
          No? Will you expose me, undoing the peace
          so many have just died for? Morally,
          you're in checkmate, just like the
          Comedian was.
          Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I'm afraid he's correct. Exposing Adrian
          would only doom the world to nuclear
          destruction again.

          DAN
          He's right. All we did was fail to stop
          him from saving Earth.

          LAURIE
          We we can't say anything about this

          ?

          RORSCHACH
          You're joking, of course.
          Rorschach walks toward the exit.

          DAN
          Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this
          out!

          RORSCHACH
          Never. Not even in the face of
          Armageddon. Never compromise.
          Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing
          this, Dan runs after Rorschach.

          DAN
          Rorschach!
          Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the
          exit.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Where are you going, Rorschach?

          RORSCHACH
          Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America.
          People must be told. Evil must be
          punished.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          117.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Rorschach, you know I can't let you do
          that.
          Rorschach pauses. Dan is halfway there . Rorschach
          removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes.

          RORSCHACH
          Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If
          you had cared from the start, none of
          this would be necessary. None of this
          would have happened. So what are you
          waiting for? Do it.

          DAN

          NO WAIT!

          RORSCHACH

          DO IT!!!!
          Jon WAVES HIS HAND and BLOWS RORSCHACH APART. Dan collapses
          to his knees, sobbing. Jon contemplates the BURN-MARK where
          Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears--
          --reappearing across the hall where Laurie is. She is also in
          tears, watching all the horrible footage on the TV screens.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Laurie. I'm leaving this galaxy. For one
          a little less complicated.

          LAURIE
          Leaving? I, I thought you regained an
          interest in human life.

          DR. MANHATTAN
          I have. I think maybe I'll create some.
          Goodbye, Laurie.
          He kisses her on the cheek--

          ADRIAN
          Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made
          myself feel every death, see every
          innocent face I've murdered to save
          humanity--you understand, don't you?

          DR. MANHATTAN
          Without condoning or condemning, I

          UNDERSTAND
          And with that, he disappears. Forever.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          118.

          CONTINUED: (3)
          Across the hall, Dan recovers from mourning Rorschach. He
          stands, gritting his teeth. Walks toward Adrian.

          ADRIAN
          What's on your mind, Dan?

          DAN
          Your death.

          ADRIAN
          Really. You want to kill me?

          DAN
          Yeah. You might have created peace, but
          not at the expense of justice. You need
          to pay for what you've done.

          ADRIAN
          That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That
          sounds more like Rorschach.

          DAN
          Exactly.
          Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV
          screens.

          ADRIAN
          Only you're not Rorschach, are you now?
          How do you expect to succeed where he
          failed?

          DAN
          Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't.
          Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life.
          His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is
          informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About
          justice. About life.
          But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with
          ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so
          focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final
          strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily.

          LAURIE
          Dan!
          Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her
          attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor,
          knocking her out.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          119.

          CONTINUED: (4)
          Dan falls to his knees, bloody and beaten. Out of tricks, out
          of time, he searches his belt for something, anything, and
          finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate, he

          FLICKS IT AT ADRIAN--
          Who merely SNATCHES the owl-Wing out of the air. He laughs.
          Prepares to finish Dan off.

          ADRIAN
          I have to say, I've always thought your
          choice of an owl was quite juvenile.

          DAN
          Really? I've always liked owls
          Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt.
          Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND
          falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          because you can never hear them
          coming.
          BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL-
          SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan.
          Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor.
          Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered.
          Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a
          fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying.

          ADRIAN
          I . don't regret my actions. I know
          in my heart . I did the right thing.

          DAN
          So do I.
          Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies.

          INT. OWL-SHIP - MORNING

          Dan sits painfully in the passenger seat, as Laurie tries to
          pilot the ship out of Adrian's bedroom.

          DAN
          That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick
          to the left
          The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out
          more glass.

          DAN (CONT'D)
          Now, the thrusters . There.
          She HITS THE THRUSTERS. The ship FLIES from the control room.
          It's afterburners IGNITING the room, and Adrian's body.

          EXT. ANTARCTICA - MORNING

          The Owl-Ship RISES into the sky, the Pyramid of Karnak
          BLAZING from it's tip like a Roman candle. Dan watches out
          the window, until his eyes slip shut

          EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MORNING (SOME TIME LATER)

          Time has passed. The disintegrated buildings are being
          rebuilt. The shock of the attack is wearing off, and though
          the streets may not be as crowded as they once were, a sense
          of normalcy is returning.
          Sally Jupiter walks the sidewalk, looking for an address.

          INT. DAN AND LAURIE'S TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

          Sally mixes herself a tall drink at the bar. Sally calls out:

          SALLY
          You sure you don't want a drink?

          LAURIE (O.S.)
          I'm okay. Thanks.
          We finally see Laurie now--her hair dyed, appearance changed.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          Mom--I just want to get this out of the
          way . . I know Eddie Blake, the
          Comedian--I know he was my father.
          Sally freezes.

          LAURIE (CONT'D)
          I remember.
          Sally downs her drink, immediately starts making another.

          SALLY
          It, it was years later, he stopped by out
          of the blue, and, and apologized. I don't
          know, I just couldn't stay mad. It
          just happened--
          Laurie kisses her mother's teary cheek.

          LAURIE
          Mom. People's lives take them strange
          places. You never did anything wrong by
          me.
          Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.

          SALLY
          What the hell is that?

          LAURIE
          Oh that's Dan. Home from "work."
          The bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the
          secret ELEVATOR. He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed
          with color. Buttoning up his shirt, he spots Sally.

          DAN
          Oh hi.

          SALLY
          Hello, Dan. Excuse me, I should clean up.
          Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom.
          Dan and Laurie embrace, kiss.

          LAURIE
          Any bad guys last night?

          DAN
          There are always bad guys. Even in
          today's world.
          Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York
          skyline being rebuilt.

          LAURIE
          Dan.

          DAN
          Hmm?

          LAURIE
          Will it be alright? The world, I mean.
          He puts his arm around her shoulder.

          DAN
          As long as no-one ever finds out that
          Adrian was behind it all, the public will
          think ion is still up there, watching.

          SEYMOUR

          UH

          --I leave it entirely in your hands.
          --and picks up Rorschach's Journal . Just as he's about

                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

                               VALIANT
               Check the scrawl.

                               DOLORES
                      (reads)
               R.K. Maroon.

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

                               DOLORES
               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

                               VALIANT
               Keep reading...

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (reads)
               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.
               T-t-that's all, folks.
                      (turns to
                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,
                folks!

     CARTOON MUSIC UP.

                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

                               VALIANT
               Check the scrawl.

                               DOLORES
                      (reads)
               R.K. Maroon.

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

                               DOLORES
               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

                               VALIANT
               Keep reading...

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (reads)
               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.
               T-t-that's all, folks.
                      (turns to
                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,
                folks!

     CARTOON MUSIC UP.

                                               IRIS OUT.

                                THE END

                          Act I

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!

                          Act I

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!

             Don't bother us now, honey -- this old
             incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to
             lose a lot of our chicks.

                       DOROTHY
             Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh,
             but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right
             over the back with a rake just because
             she says he gets in her garden and chases
             her nasty old cat every day.

                       DOROTHY
             Oh, but he doesn't do it every day --
             just once or twice a week. And he can't
             catch her old cat, anyway. And now she
             says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --

                          AUNT EM
             Dorothy!     Dorothy!   We're busy!

                       UNCLE HENRY
             Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch
             troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know,
             she ought to have somebody to play with.

                       AUNT EM
             I know, but we all got to work out our
             own problems, Henry.

                          UNCLE HENRY
             Yes.

          Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

          place. Then Toto won't get in her
          garden, and you won't get in no trouble.
          See?

                    DOROTHY
          Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's

          kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a
          poor sour-faced old maid that -- she
          ain't got no heart left. You know, you
          should have a little more heart yourself,
          and have pity on her.

                    DOROTHY
          Well, gee, I try and have a heart.

                    DOROTHY
          This?

                    HICKORY
          Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't
          have no more dust storms. Can you imagine
          what it'll mean to this section of the
          country? I'll show you. It works
          perfectly now. Here's the principle. You
          see that fan -- that sends up air
          currents into the sky. These air currents

                    SCARECROW
          Do you think if I went with you this
          Wizard would give me some brains?

                    DOROTHY
          I couldn't say. But even if he didn't,
          you'd be no worse off than you are now.

                    SCARECROW
          Yes -- that's true.

                    DOROTHY
          But maybe you'd better not. I've got a
          witch mad at me, and you might get into
          trouble.

                    SCARECROW
          Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch!
          I'm not afraid of anything --- except a
          lighted match.

                    DOROTHY
          I don't blame you for that.

                    SCARECROW
          But I'd face a whole box full of them for
          the chance of getting some brains. Look -
          - I won't be any trouble, because I don't
          eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage
          things, because I can't think. Won't you
          take me with you?

          brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me!
          Hah!

                    TIN MAN

                    SCARECROW
          Oh, you don't think we're going to stand
          by and let her get away with fireballs

          had! And it's funny, but I feel as if
          I've known you all the time. But I
          couldn't have, could I?

                    SCARECROW
          I don't see how. You weren't around when
          I was stuffed and sewn together, were
          you?

                    TIN MAN
          And I was standing over there rusting for

          Still, I wish I could remember.    But, I
          guess it doesn't matter anyway.   We know
          each other now, don't we?

          That's right.

             very mediocre commodity. Every
             pusillanimous creature that crawls on the
             earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has
             a brain!

             that as it may. Back where I come from we
             have universities, seats of great
             learning -- where men go to become great
             thinkers. And when they come out, they
             think deep thoughts -- and with no more
             brains than you have.... But! They have
             one thing you haven't got! A diploma!

             confer upon you the honorary degree of

          Well, you can't. As for you, my fine
          friend -- you're a victim of disorganized
          thinking. You are under the unfortunate
          delusion that simply because you run away
          from danger, you have no courage. You're
          confusing courage with wisdom. Back
          where I come from, we have men who are
          called heroes. Once a year, they take
          their fortitude out of mothballs and
          parade it down the main street of the
          city. And they have no more courage than
          you have. But! They have one thing that
          you haven't got! A medal! Therefore --
          for meritorious....

          As for you, my galvanized friend, you
          want a heart! You don't know how lucky
          you are not to have one. Hearts will
          never be practical until they can be made
          unbreakable. I could have been a world

          EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

          A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering
          black spruce. A flock of pintails skims over the treetops,
          heading south before the first snowfall.
          A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag
          strapped to his back. Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy
          looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time.
          Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in
          the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a
          hard-charging engine.
          An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it
          hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but
          the car comes straight at him.
          The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down
          on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to
          spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows.
          Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their
          leather-sleeved football jackets. GILMAN, the largest of the
          four, shakes his head and laughs.

          GILMAN
          Kid didn't even move. You see that?
          Where's your survival instincts,
          boy?
          The boy says nothing. He readjusts his bookbag and resumes
          his long walk northward.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          Hey!
          Gilman grabs the boy's shoulder and spins him around-
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          The hell you going? You hear me
          talking to you?
          One of the other football players, MASON, walks over and
          inspects the boy's face.

          MASON
          This is the kid whose old man
          robbed the truck stop last year.
          Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck
          and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him. The four lettermen
          tower over the small boy.

          CONTINUED:

          GILMAN
          You the one with the convict daddy?
          The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking.

          MASON
          That's him.

          GILMAN
          What's the matter, you about to
          piss your pants? Answer me.
          The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully.
          Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring,
          against the.boy's cheek.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          You a tough guy like your daddy?
          Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The
          boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          You want to play tough guy with me?
          Huh?
          Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his
          stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face.
          The boy falls to the ground. Blood spills from a gash in his
          cheek where the class ring cut him.

          MASON
          (a ringside announcer)
          Right cross to the face... and he's
          down!
          The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy.
          The boy stands. There is still no sign of emotion on his
          face. No fear, no anger, no evident pain.

          GILMAN
          What's the matter? You want some
          more?
          The boy doesn't look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy
          in the side of the head, knocking him down again.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          (to his friends)
          Let's get out of here.

          Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder.

          MASON
          You gave that little pissant
          something to think about.
          Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be
          sprawled and crying on the ground.
          Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt,
          and walks toward Gilman.

          GILMAN
          You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna
          knock the--
          But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something
          impossible happening. The gash on the boy's cheek knits
          itself shut, leaving no sign of injury.
          Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing
          toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another punch.
          And then another.
          The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights
          with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and
          headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy.
          Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down,
          trying to protect his face from the blur of blows.
          Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite
          to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off.
          The other two football players, amazed to see their leader
          getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe.
          The boy growls as he batters the bully. He grabs Gilman's
          collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground,
          prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist.
          Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and
          razor sharp.
          Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits
          hollering and stares. The other two football players blink
          and slowly back away.
          Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl
          backwards, away from this beast on top of him.

          But the boy is more shocked than-any of them. He stares with
          horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed.
          He stands and stumbles away from Gilman. Mason runs over,
          lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him
          toward the Oldsmobile.
          The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and
          speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road.
          The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see
          fear in his eyes. He screams, a scream that echoes over the
          black spruce, into the darkening northern sky.

          LOGAN wakes. with a wordless shout, sitting upright,
          shirtless, in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets.
          KAYLA SILVERFOX (25) wraps her arms around him and whispers
          in his ear.

          KAYLA
          It's okay... shh... it's okay.
          Logan pants, chest heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered
          sheets in his fists. Kayla holds him tight until his bone
          claws retract.

          I'm right here with you. Okay? I'm

          Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears her long black hair pulled
          back in a ponytail. She's been sleeping in one of Logan's

          KAYLA (cont'd)
          The war dreams or the one where

          Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down. He relaxes
          into Kayla's arms.

          LOGAN
          The one where I'm a kid.
          Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his
          forehead. He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm. He
          takes her arm and looks at the wound.

          A traveling carnival has come to a seaside New England town.
          The brightly-lit Ferris Wheel spins a few hundred yards
          inland from the dark Atlantic.
          LOCALS roam through the carnival, lining up to ride the Tilt-
          A-Whirl. KIDS carrying plumes of cotton candy race from shoot-

          The crowd hushes. A tall man in a hooded robe shuffles toward,
          the stage like a boxer long past his prime. He stands in
          front of the gawkers, head bowed, face shadowed by his hood.

          Finally BEAK throws off his robe and raises his wings to the
          crowd. As advertised, he looks like an amalgam of man and
          bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings.
          His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated
          by a long sharp beak. He stares back at the gaping crowd.
          Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous. His skinny limbs
          don't seem very strong and he projects an air of weary
          resignation, not menace.
          But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers,
          the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their
          father's legs.

          INT. BEAK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

          Sherrlene and Beak sit at a card table, playing gin and
          drinking bourbon.

          SHERRLENE
          I'm gonna knock with three.

          BEAK
          Are you kidding me?
          He throws down his hand in disgust.

          SHERRLENE
          You always hold out for gin. You
          could have knocked a while ago.

          BEAK
          Yeah, well, I'm an eternal.
          optimist.
          Sherrlene tallies the points.

          SHERRLENE
          All right, I'm gonna hit it. You
          want to come look for shells with
          me on the beach tomorrow?

          BEAK
          I don't want to scare away any
          tourists.

          SHERRLENE
          Aw, sweetie, it's winter. No
          tourists. I'll come get you in the
          morning.

          side of his feathered head.

          BEAK
          Goodnight, Sherrlene.

          SHERRLENE
          Night, Beak. Sweet dreams.
          Sherrlene closes the door behind her and Beak flips through
          the deck of cards, preparing for another lonely night.
          A knock on the door.

          BEAK
          You forget your purse?
          (another knock)
          All right, all right, I'm coming.
          He stands and opens the door.

          A towering figure in a long black coat looms beside the
          trailer's door.

          VICTOR CREED is shrouded in shadows, but when he grins his
          white fangs gleam. He drapes his arm around Beak and drags
          the birdman inside the trailer.

          Creed shoves Beak back into his seat, picks up the bottle of
          bourbon, examines the label, and guzzles it. Beak opens his
          mouth but no words come out. Finally:

          Creed smiles down at his feathered target. Beak tries to
          shield his body with his wings.

          An awful, prolonged shriek escapes from the trailer.

          EXT. CABIN - DAY

          The small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine forest.
          Winter has come to the north country; the ground and tree
          branches are covered with several inches of snow.
          Logan chops firewood behind the cabin, splitting the logs
          with expert axe strikes, smoking a cheap cigar.
          His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air.

          LOGAN.
          Smells like government.
          Behind Logan, two approaching men in dark suits and black
          overcoats glance at each other. Logan, halving another block
          of wood, doesn't turn around.
          One of the newcomers, STRYKER, was a colonel in the Special
          Forces. He still has the look. His hair is cropped short, his
          bearing is military, and his blue eyes are fierce.

          haven't aged a day. Everyone else
          gets old and gray, but not you.

          STRYKER
          We never lost you, my friend. I

          Logan and Agent Zero stare at each other. There is a history
          between these two and clearly the memories are not fond.

          AGENT ZERO

          Logan spits the butt of the severed cigar from his mouth and
          clenches his fists.

          a load of firewood and . stacks. it beside the cabin.

          STRYKER
          We're putting together a team. Best
          men in the business. Men with...
          special qualities. Men like you.

          LOGAN

          Logan walks around to the front of the cabin. Stryker and
          Agent Zero follow. Logan's battered old pickup truck is
          parked beside the newcomers' Lincoln.

          STRYKER
          It's a team of hunters. We're going

          Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to
          warm it. Stryker taps on the window. Logan grits his teeth
          and rolls down the window, not looking at the colonel.

          EXT. DISTRICT UNIFIED SCHOOL - DAY

          Logan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school.
          He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building.
          The school day has ended. STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS or
          DADS for the ride home.
          As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking
          around. Something's not quite right.
          Logan'ducks his head at the last. possible second and a
          snowball whizzes past, missing him by inches.
          Six FOURTH GRADERS (four boys and two girls) charge at him,
          hurling snowballs and screaming.

          FOURTH GRADERS
          Get him!
          Logan jumps back around the corner, out of sight. The fourth
          graders chase after him, round the corner with their throwing
          hands cocked, ready to launch some serious ice.
          Logan is nowhere in sight.
          The fourth graders turn in confused circles, searching for
          their target, snowballs melting in their hands.

          LOGAN (O.S.)
          Hey, fellas.
          The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a second-
          floor window ledge. He has already formed six perfect
          snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders.
          The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with
          Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan.

          KAYLA
          Nice.
          Logan, caught with a snowball in his hand, looks sheepish.

          KAYLA
          So why can't they get someone else?
          Logan thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a
          degree of self-loathing in his tone.

          LOGAN
          I'm the best there is at what I do.
          And what I do best isn't very nice.

          only thing I'm good for.

          himself of an errant thought.

          Kayla drops Logan off at the logging camp. The site is
          already loud with motorized activity. TRIMMERS remove the
          limbs from fallen trees. TEAMSTERS in forklifts load logs
          onto flatbed trucks.
          Logan comes around to the driver's side window, holding his
          orange Husqvarna chainsaw in one hand.

          KAYLA
          Be careful.
          Logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips. He turns and
          walks towards a crew of LUMBERJACKS circled around a
          SUPERVISOR with a clipboard.
          Logan turns when he hears a honk. Kayla leans out the window.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          I love you, by the way.
          Logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this

          The lumberjacks laugh loudly. Damage done, Kayla waves a
          cheerful goodbye and drives away from the camp.

          Kayla hits the brakes and checks-her watch. She's late. She
          taps the horn.
          A FOREMAN ambles over to her, in no particular rush.

          Logan and three other lumberjacks-- PHELAN, MARCUSE, and VAN
          MIER-- tramp through the woods towards their designated area,
          carrying their chainsaws and helmets.
          Phelan, whiskey-bellied and flushed from the exertion, has
          fallen behind.

          PHELAN
          You all want to ease the pace a
          little bit? Trees ain't going
          anywhere.
          Logan, in the lead, stares at a crude smiley face carved into
          a tall pine tree. His gaze travels from the carving to
          something sitting on the forest floor.

          Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly
          collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the
          brakes and the truck shudders to a halt.
          The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His
          hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's
          been sleeping in the woods for weeks.
          Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can
          speak, the man in the long black coat turns.
          It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is
          massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons
          curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks
          as he smiles at her.
          What terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark's eyes,
          black and loveless and utterly inhuman.

          over the hood: screeeeee. Five parallel gashes now scar the
          hood, carved straight through the steel.

          EXT. TIMBER STAND - CONTINUOUS

          Logan, hearing a noise the other men can't, rises from his
          crouch. He looks to the west, listening carefully.

          PHELAN
          What's the matter--
          Logan holds up a hand: quiet. He hears a distant scream. A.
          voice he knows better than any other.
          He runs, leaving his astonished co-workers behind.
          No one can run through the woods faster than Logan and'Logan
          has never needed to run faster. He vaults fallen trees, ducks
          under branches, accelerates when he hits the access road.

          EXT. ACCESS ROAD - MINUTES LATER

          Logan sees the pickup truck in the distance. Even a hundred
          yards away he can tell that something is.wrong.
          It seems impossible that he could run any faster, but now he
          does, reaching the truck in seconds. He sees the claw marks
          gouged through the steel hood.
          He sees.the driver's side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty
          yards. from the truck.
          And finally he sees Kayla, curled in the fetal position on
          the side of the access road. Blood puddles beneath her. Her
          skin has already begun to lose its 'color.
          He runs to her, kneels beside her body, hands checking for a
          pulse, listening for breath, trying desperately to find any
          sign of life in her lifeless form.

          LOGAN

          He rocks back and forth, her lifeless body clutched tightly
          in his arms, his eyes clenched shut.
          The veins bulge in his neck, every muscle in his body tenses,
          as if there were a beast inside him trying to break free of
          his skin.

          INT. CASADY'S BAR & GRILL - DAY

          The local dive opens early. TOWN DRUNKS sit by themselves,
          smoking cigarettes, sipping the day's first hair-of--the-dog,
          reading the paper or staring into their beer.
          Victor Creed sits at the bar, carving a crude smiley face
          into the wood with the claw of his index finger. He looks up
          and sees the BARTENDER staring at him. The bartender doesn't
          approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything.
          Creed taps the rim of his glass. The bartender comes over
          with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey. He fills
          Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour.
          Creed stares at the bartender. He taps the glass again. The
          bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim.
          Creed raises the whiskey to the light.

          VICTOR CREED
          Stuff don't work on me. I drink and
          drink and I never feel any
          different.
          He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow. He looks
          around the bar, at the pool table in the back, the Wurlitzer
          jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          You got any insurance on this
          place?

          BARTENDER
          Insurance? I guess so. Why?
          Creed wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.

          VICTOR CREED
          'Cause it's about to get ugly.
          Logan walks into the tavern, sniffing the air. He sees Creed
          sitting on the barstool, back to the door.

          Logan approaches the bar, never taking his eyes off creed.
          Finally Creed turns to look at Logan. He stands, towering
          above the smaller man.
          Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creed's
          hand. Creed knows Logan is looking at it. He lifts his hand
          to his mouth and licks the blood off.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          Sweet girl. Tasted like strawberry
          jam.
          The bone claws burst from Logan's hands, pale, white, and
          serrated. He growls and swings at Creed's head.
          The big man is fast. He ducks under the claws, grinning and
          circling like a boxer, happy that he's finally got a decent
          adversary.
          The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar
          fights, but not ones featuring clawed mutants. They run.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          You can scare off the civilians
          with those, sonny boy. But I got
          claws of my own.
          He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing
          first blood. Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins.
          -The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power
          stupendous. A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out
          the guts of the jukebox. Logan jumps at his enemy and gets
          swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard.
          Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool
          table. Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize
          Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear. Creed's fist
          shatters the slate and the table collapses.
          Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the
          eight ball rolling past. He picks it up and hurls it at
          Creed's head.
          Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes
          his fist shut. He opens his hand and lets the powdered
          remains spill onto the floor.
          Logan springs to his feet and swings at creed, again and
          again, his claws whooshing through the air.

          Creed, despite his bulk, is an elegant fighter. He circles
          just out of reach, grinning as the claws slash past his face.
          Creed grabs Logan's right wrist as it flies by. He grabs the
          left wrist. His wet fangs glisten as they plunge toward
          Logan's throat.

          With no room to dodge, Logan drives his head forward,
          smashing Creed's face with a glorious headbutt.

          As Creed staggers back, Logan kicks him in the chest,
          knocking the big man over the bar, where he crashes into the
          bottles of liquor and slides to the floor in a tumult of
          glass shards and alcohol.
          Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the
          tables. He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar.
          The cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol. Creed roars and
          rises to his feet, a burning man.
          He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan. The flames
          consume his overcoat, licking at his skin. Creed slaps them
          out with his palms, apparently oblivious to the pain.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          You put up a better fight than your
          girl did.
          Creed snatches Logan and slings him headfirst through the
          plate glass window.

          Logan hits the snow-covered pavement hard, splinters -of glass
          in his hair, his face bloodied from dozens of small cuts.
          Creed steps out the bar. As Logan struggles to his feet Creed
          kicks out his legs and drops him again.
          Creed crouches beside Logan, grabs the back of his head, and
          smashes his face into the concrete.
          The beating gets savage, creed hammering Logan again and
          again. Logan's healing factor cannot keep up with the
          violence being done to his body.

          VICTOR CREED

          but this is another level of suffering.

          Creed stands, staring down at Logan's unmoving body. Sirens

          Logan presses the claws of his left hand to the wolf's
          throat. The wolf quits fighting, mewling submissively. He
          goes slack in Logan's grip, rolling over to signal surrender.
          Logan stands over the newly-subservient alpha wolf. The other
          wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion.
          Intense light shines on Logan's face. He turns and sees that
          he's surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS wearing tactical armor.
          Powerful flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their
          guns, which are pointed at Logan.
          The wolves flee, dodging through the pines, their paws
          kicking up snow.

          Hands in the air, now!
          Logan charges at the soldiers.
          The soldiers fire their weapons. These are not rifles but
          high-powered Tasers. Twelve darts sink into Logan's skin,
          each connected to a silvery wire.
          Thousands of volts of electricity course through Logan's
          body.

          James Hudson cautiously slides his barn door open. He holds
          an old shotgun in his hands, a gun he hasn't fired in years.
          He advances slowly into the barn, sunlight from the open door
          falling on the scattered straw. A vintage motorcycle covered
          in a tarp stands near the side wall.
          Hudson looks inside each sheep pen. His thick-wooled SHEEP,
          ready for breakfast, bleat hopefully.
          In the third pen Hudson finds Logan, who has covered himself
          with straw. A few curious sheep sniff at the fugitive's face.
          Hudson stares at Logan, who stares back somewhat, well,
          sheepishly.

          JAMES HUDSON
          Son... What in hell are you doing?

          He turns and Logan begins covering strategic places with wads
          of straw.

          work boots.
          A heaping breakfast lies before him: scrambled eggs, pork
          sausages, pancakes with maple syrup, a steaming mug of
          coffee.
          Logan devours everything in front of him, looking up only to
          nod in thanks as Heather scoops more food onto his plate.

          I'm just wondering. We're twenty
          miles from town. It's a miracle you
          didn't get hypothermia out there.

          Nice chopper you got out there, by

          Logan dives across the table, trying to knock her out of the

          window frame and straight through Heather Hudson's heart.

          He lowers the passenger window and gets a bead on Logan, who
          swerves to keep himself (and his more fragile motorcycle) a
          tricky target.

          Agent Zero fires six shells in rapid succession. Hundreds of
          steel pellets scream over the motorcycle, perforating the
          face of a smiling farmer on a fertilizer billboard.
          Logan turns and sees the SUV closing on him. Agent Zero rams

          He holds out his left hand and extends his claws. The tips of
          the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly.
          The SUV cannot brake in time. As it hurtles past the
          motorcycle, Logan's claws hit the SUV's front tire and shred
          it instantly. A split-second later he shreds the rear tire.
          The SUV totters, falls to its side, and barrel rolls across
          the empty road. It ends up on its roof in a drainage ditch,
          wheels still spinning in the air.
          Logan turns his bike and pulls up next to the upended SUV. He
          lowers the kickstand, stands, and walks to the driver's side.
          Agent Zero, bloodied and dazed, has managed to push open the
          door. He leans out and aims his shotgun at Logan, who slices
          the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws.

          Francis has a gentle smile as he feeds the lemurs leaf-eater
          biscuits. He speaks to them as they shriek,: clambering over
          his lap, biscuits clutched in their tiny hands.

          Even at this hour the gym is packed with aspiring PUGILISTS.
          Las Vegas has become the Mecca of world boxing, and many 'of
          the fighters here exhibit impressive skills as they batter
          the heavy bag, tap at the speed bag, and jump rope.
          Logan walks toward a ring in the center of the gym. Two young
          BOXERS inside the ropes, wearing headgear and sparring
          gloves, dance around throwing quick jabs that don't land.
          JOHN WRAITH (45) stands outside the ring, watching this
          action with evident distaste. He wears a black cowboy hat,
          sunglasses, and a handlebar mustache. He has the swagger and
          drawl of a rodeo cowboy.

          with the toe of his boot, and heads for the supermarket.

          INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

          Two STOCK BOYS, wearing bright blue vests over red shirts,
          stand at one of the aisle dividers, hiding behind a stack of
          breakfast pastries. They are plainly terrified.

          STOCK BOY #1
          Say something.

          STOCK BOY #2
          You say something. It's your

          STOCK BOY #1
          Dude...
          The stock boy peeks around the divider. FRED J. DUKES,
          a.k.a., THE BLOB, stands in the center of the aisle, tearing
          open bags of pork rinds and pouring them down his gullet.
          Dukes is the biggest man you've ever seen. By a long shot.
          Just shy of seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton,
          he's beyond fat. Beyond obese.
          His eyes look like pinpricks in the swollen enormity of his
          face. When he shifts his bulk, ripples cascade down his
          flanks, his flesh trembling with each breath.

          LOGAN (O.S.)
          Jesus, Dukes...
          Dukes, mouth and chin dusted with fried pork skin, turns his
          head to examine the pest standing next to him.
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          Maybe it's time to give the pork
          rinds a rest.
          Dukes swings his arm. Despite his enormous mass, the man
          moves with surprising speed. Not quick enough to catch Logan,
          though, who ducks beneath the blow.
          Dukes's forearm, thicker than a fire hydrant, smashes through
          the steel shelving. Bags of pork rinds and potato chips
          tumble to the floor.
          Snikt! Logan shows his glittering claws to the big man.
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          I'll fillet you standing, fat man.
          That what you want?
          Dukes hesitates. That is not what he wants.,
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          .Where's Victor Creed?
          Dukes grunts and bulls forward, toppling the heavily-laden
          shelves into the next aisle. Panicked SHOPPERS scream and run
          for the exits.
          Dukes blasts through the cereal aisle, too, with a great
          rending of steel, his giant shoes crushing boxes of Lucky
          Charms as he stomps into the produce section.

          A coconut bounces off Dukes's head. Enraged, the giant turns
          and sees Logan standing by a pile of hairy coconuts, tossing
          one in his hand like a baseball.
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          You're gonna help me, bub. You_just
          don't know it yet.
          Dukes bellows and runs at Logan. A coconut pelts him in the
          face, angering him further. Logan jumps out of the way as
          Dukes brings down his massive fists. Coconuts explode.
          Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked
          grapefruits, clusters of bananas.
          After a thirty second rampage Dukes is exhausted, his giant
          chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and face
          splattered with remnants of crushed fruit.
          Logan jumps onto Dukes' back. The fat man roars and spins
          around, trying to buck the little rider, but Logan's got one
          arm wrapped around Dukes' throat and he's not letting go.
          The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down.
          Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow's face,
          reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights.
          Dukes quits, his massive shoulders slumping. He sinks to his
          knees, his great bulk splitting the linoleum floor.
          Logan presses his claws against Dukes' quivering jowls.
          LOGAN (cont'd)

          Come on, he's your friend. When was
          the last time you talked to him?

          FRED J. DUKES
          Friend? He don't have any friends.
          All he's got is victims.

          LOGAN
          Careful, Dukes. I can smell a lie
          before you even tell it.
          The Blob begins to cry, the great bellows of his cheeks
          trembling, tears and snot dribbling down his face.

          Logan pulls a handkerchief out of his back pocket and hands
          it to Dukes.

          LOGAN
          All right, take it easy.
          Dukes blows his nose into the handkerchief, one of history's
          loudest and most violent nasal ejaculations.
          He offers back the soiled handkerchief. Logan waves it off.
          LOGAN (cont'd)
          It's a gift.
          Dukes takes a deep breath, gathering himself.

          Talked about it all the time-- how
          hot the girlies were. That's all I
          know.
          Logan shaves Dukes' jaw with the edge of his claw.

          LOGAN
          Nah. You know more than that.
          Dukes tilts his face, trying to keep his face from getting
          scraped off.

          FRED J. DUKES
          Joint's owned by a guy named
          Barbarus. Shared a cell with Creed
          in the ultramax. Anyone knows where

          we have information that he was in
          Las Vegas two nights ago. We'll
          find him soon.

          GENERAL MUNSON
          This is turning into a goddamn
          disaster, Colonel.

          STRYKER
          I disagree. I'd say the experiment
          has been a success.

          GENERAL MUNSON
          Success? Are you kidding me?

          STRYKER
          Weapon X is a prototype. Nothing
          more. He's the walking proof that
          enhanced skeletons are viable.
          That, along with the healing factor
          we've replicated from his blood,
          will insure that the Eleven is
          capable of protecting our species
          from extinction.

          At this point, Logan is merely an
          inconvenience. He won't be for
          long.

          GENERAL MUNSON
          I'm sorry, William. I've lost
          confidence in your leadership. I'm
          going to recommend your dismissal
          to the Joint Chiefs.
          Stryker stares out the window at the distant lake, with no
          visible reaction to the General's words.

          doing. But I don't. War with the
          mutants is not inevitable.
          The general coughs. He begins to look confused as he coughs
          again, his breathing gone suddenly ragged. He clutches at his
          chest.
          A thin smile curls Stryker's lips. He turns to regard the
          General.

          STRYKER
          You're having a massive heart
          attack, sir. Leading cause of death
          for men in your age bracket.
          The general gasps for air, trying to rise to his feet. In his
          death throes, he knocks the glass of water from the table. It
          shatters on the floor.

          A heavy rain falls in the French Quarter. There is no sign
          outside the club, only.a gargantuan BOUNCER standing in front
          of an unmarked door in a dark alley.
          The bouncer apprises the stocky mutant walking his way.

          Only when we go CLOSE ON THE BOUNCER do we realize he has a
          single eye, large and bloodshot, centered in his forehead..

          INT. CLUB SUPERIOR - MOMENTS LATER

          The dimly-lit club is the size of a warehouse and jammed with
          PARTYING MUTANTS. Most of them look like normal humans but a
          few are "overts," distinguished by curling horns, scaled skin
          and other genetic abnormalities.
          A sexy WAITRESS walks by with a tray of drinks. She winks at
          Logan. A "Kiss Me, I'm a Mutant" button is pinned to her
          shirt.
          Industrial beats pour out of speakers bolted to the ceilings.
          Logan surveys the room. A young PUSHER approaches, his long
          sideburns shaved into scimitars running down his jawline.

          Logan's fist splits the clipboard and crushes the skinhead's

          The VIP MUTANTS -sit at plush booths, downing shots of
          tequila. They grope their GIRLFRIENDS. They arm wrestle and
          compare tattoos and gobble down fried oysters.
          BARBARUS sits in a corner booth. He wears a custom-made wife-
          beater. The brutally-muscled mutant has four arms, all
          sleeved in tattoos.
          One hand pours himself a new glass of Jack Daniel's. A second
          hand gouges his name into the table top with a black steel
          commando knife. The third drums the beat of the current song
          on the vinyl booth's backrest.
          The fourth hand pets PANTERA, the nubile mutant sitting on
          his lap, a beautiful young woman entirely covered in
          glistening black fur. Her yellow eyes glitter.
          Logan approaches the table. Barbarus stares up at him.
          Pantera purrs, yellow eyes on Logan.

          The other MUTANTS quiet down, watching the fireworks.
          Barbarus swings, the four knives whistling through the air.
          Logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as
          Barbarus advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel.
          Logan slashes and one severed hand falls to the ground.
          Barbarus howls, stabbing at Logan with his three good arms.
          Logan's claws flash through the air again, and another neatly
          severed hand lands on the table.
          Logan retracts his claws and curls one finger: come at me.
          Barbarus, shamed and furious, gathers himself and charges.
          Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the ball of his
          foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a
          well-hit baseball.
          Barbarus crashes to the floor. Pantera hisses and pounces at
          Logan, her black claws aimed at his face. Logan backhands
          her. She hits the floor and slides across the hardwood.

          Wraith hits the gas and the Mustang squeals out in reverse.
          He slams on the brakes, shifts into drive, and guns the car
          right at Creed.
          An instant before impact, Creed sidesteps the car and punches
          through the driver's window.
          It's a miracle of a punch, timed perfectly, a crushing shot
          to Wraith's jaw. Wraith loses control. of the car and it
          sideswipes a parked Hummer, spinning to a stop against a
          concrete wall.
          Wraith blinks and tries to clear his head. Creed reaches
          inside the broken window and hauls the Texan out. He lifts

          INT. HINES' HOUSE - NIGHT

          Carol Hines, the Army surgeon last seen in Alkali Lake,
          unlocks her front door and steps inside her house.
          she looks exhausted, with deep circles under her eyes. She
          puts her keys and the mail on a table by the door and then
          looks up, startled, when she hears SHRIEKING.
          Hines, very nervous, advances into the dark kitchen.
          She flicks on the lights. A red kettle on the stove top
          whistles. A mug waits on the counter. Hines, mystified, turns
          off the burner.

          LOGAN (V.0.)
          Pour yourself a cup of tea.
          Hines spins around. Logan sits at the kitchen table, an unlit
          cigar in his mouth.

          They both sit at the kitchen table now. Logan smokes his
          cigar and watches Hines, who clutches her mug of tea with
          trembling hands.
          Logan watches her through the haze of smoke.

          LOGAN
          Careful, Doc. I can smell a lie. I
          can hear it. Maybe you start to
          sweat a little bit. Maybe the pitch
          of your voice changes. But I'll
          know.

          Hines opens her mouth, closes it, opens it again.

          what they'll do to me.

          the Weapon Ultra program. Started
          sixty-five years ago. They've been
          trying to make the perfect soldier

          it's mutants.

          LOGAN
          So where does Weapon X fit in?
          Hines closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.

          HINES
          You don't understand. X is a letter
          but it's also a Roman numeral.
          Weapon "Ex" is a nickname.
          Officially, you're Weapon Ten.

          prototypes. The final product is
          almost ready. Weapon Eleven.
          Logan's face darkens as the extent of his betrayal becomes
          clear to him.

          on his orders?
          Logan stares at her for a long count. she stares back,
          terrified but resolute.

          What's this?
          Cornelius sets the case on the table and opens it. Six
          gleaming, armor-piercing bullets rest in green felt niches.

          CORNELIUS
          We saved the leftover adamantium
          from the Weapon X procedure.
          Stryker plucks one of the bullets from its niche and rolls it
          between his fingers, examining it with a practiced eye.
          CORNELIUS (cont'd)
          Each one's got a high-explosive
          core. Two in the head and Logan's

          STRYKER
          They won't kill him?

          CORNELIUS
           According to the computer models we
          ran, there's a 30 percent chance
          his healing factor will
          reconstitute the gray matter. But
          those synaptic bridges that form
          our memories? Gone. If he survives,
          his brain will come back fresh.

          STRYKER
          A blank slate... easy to train.
          Stryker fondles the shining bullet lovingly.

          She's a pretty little thing.

          CORNELIUS
          Only problem is, the procedure can
          only be done here at Alkali Lake.
          Stryker swings the chamber shut and holsters his gun.

          EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY

          Hines, driving an old Ford, pulls up.to the guard house at
          the perimeter of the compound. A YOUNG SENTRY salutes her.

          YOUNG SENTRY

          Hines smiles brightly, trying to hide her nervousness.

          HINES

          The sentry looks into the car's cabin. The passenger seat is
          empty. The back seat is empty.

          It's all standard procedure but Hines is close to panicking.
          She opens the glove compartment and hits the trunk release.
          The sentry inspects the trunk... nothing but a coil of rope
          and a roll of electrical tape. He slams the trunk door.

          Logan and Hines stand at the top of a steel staircase, forty
          feet above the concrete floor of a massive cavern.
          Created in the 1960s by an underground hydrogen bomb test,
          the Alkali Lake cavern is the second biggest in the country,
          smaller only than the salt caverns of the Gulf Coast, home of

          high-powered machinery. Heavy steel pillars support the
          ceiling of the cavern.
          Ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor,
          arrayed in a grid, each tank slightly larger than a coffin.
          TECHNICIANS walk in between the tanks, checking gauges,
          writing notes in clipboards.
          More technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the
          cavern, overlooking the Eleven, entering information into the
          computers that monitor the sleeping army.
          Logan is awed by the sight. Hines has descended the staircase

          Dr. Cornelius and an ASSISTANT stand near a machine that is
          wired to the electric chair, fiddling with the controls, but

          I asked you nicely to join the

          But I knew if nothing else could
          motivate you, revenge would.
          Stryker smiles at Kayla, a proud professor beaming at his
          student.
          STRYKER (cont'd)
          Tell him. Tell him about the day
          you died.
          Kayla, head bowed, is silent for a long count. When she
          speaks her voice is a strange monotone, devoid of feeling.

          KAYLA
          They gave me a syringe full of
          hydrochlorothiazide.

          EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AN EARLIER DAY

          Perhaps the colors are desaturated to let us know that this
          is a scene we've witnessed before, or thought we did.
          Kayla sits behind the wheel of her pickup. Victor Creed walks
          toward her, black talons raking five gashes on the hood.
          Kayla has been expecting him. She pulls her backpack out from
          behind the seat and takes from it a hypodermic needle and a
          plastic IV bag filled with dark blood.
          Creed tears the truck's door off its hinges and tosses it
          twenty yards. Kayla injects herself with the hypodermic.

          KAYLA (V.0.)
          Reduces the heartbeat to almost
          zero. Breathing virtually stops.
          Makes you flatline for six minutes.
          Kayla hops down from the truck. She holds out the IV bag to
          Victor, who casually pierces it with his claw.
          KAYLA (V.0.) (cont'd)
          I'd been drawing my own blood every
          night for the past week. I had four
          liters ready that morning.
          Kayla smears. her own blood on her body and empties the rest
          of the bag on the pavement. She lies down in the puddle in a
          fetal position, her breathing already beginning to slow.

          But still a weakness.
          Stryker signals to Cornelius. The doctor and his assistant
          attach a nasty-looking copper halo to Logan's skull. The halo
          is wired to the electric chair.
          Logan never takes his eyes off Silverfox.

          Don't be angry at her. She was just

          What's he gonna do with us when the
          other mutants are dead? Put us in a

          Creed hesitates, considering the logic of her words. A fanged
          smile splits his face.

          VICTOR CREED
          Don't try your head games on me.
          I've gutted better telepaths than
          you.
          Creed rears back to hammer Kayla, a blow that would separate
          her head from her body.
          Logan catches Creed's fist inches from Kayla's face.

          VICTOR CREED
          Oh, I'm happy picking on men.
          Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight
          begins.
          This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted. Every
          lunge would kill any other adversary. Every parried blow
          would shatter a normal man's arm.
          Kayla, bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet. She
          helps up Hines and pushes her toward the door.

          KAYLA
          Get out of here.
          Hines doesn't have to be told twice. She flees. Creed sees
          his plaything running out the door. He snarls in frustration.

          VICTOR CREED
          You're ruining my party.
          He grabs hold of Logan and hurls him headfirst through the
          cell wall-- a concrete support wall.

          Logan crashes to the floor, covered in rubble. Creed steps
          out of the cell, licking his fangs.
          Creed tries to stomp Logan's face, but the smaller man rolls
          out of the way and gets back on his feet.
          The mutants battle down the corridor, claws whistling through
          the air.
          A team of SENTRIES charge around the corner, wearing tactical
          armor and carrying XM8 assault rifles. They level their
          rifles at the battling mutants.

          SENTRY #1
          Get down! Get down!

          SENTRY #2

          Logan and Creed, trying to punch holes in each other, ignore
          the sentries. Kayla, staring down the barrels of the big
          guns,. holds up her hands.
          She concentrates, staring into the sentries' eyes.

          KAYLA
          We're here as guests of Colonel
          Stryker.
          The sentries' hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance.

          SENTRY #1
          Very sorry about that.

          KAYLA
          You boys are no longer needed here.
          Go back to barracks.

          SENTRIES
          You got it. See ya later. Bye!
          The sentries wave cheerfully and depart.
          Creed and Logan are equally skilled, but Creed's superior
          size and strength begin to wear the smaller man down.
          Creed slams him into the wall, opening fissures. Holding both
          of Wolverine's wrists up with one hand, Creed grabs
          Wolverine's face with his free hand.

          How you gonna fight without eyes,
          little man?
          Logan brings his knee up hard, smashing his adamantium-
          enhanced kneecap into Creed's groin.
          The big man groans. Logan spins Creed around, jamming him
          against the wall. He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of
          his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment.
          Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall. He strikes
          at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again. All six
          of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall.
          He brings his hands. together, the adamantium blades slicing
          through granite as if it were cheesecake.
          Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him.
          He grabs Logan in a-bear hug.
          A large section of the wall behind them falls out, and,
          unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through
          the hole, disappearing from sight.
          Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice, looking
          out onto the gargantuan Weapon XI cavern.

          INT. WEAPON XI FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

          Logan and Creed fall seventy feet, clawing at each other in
          mid-air.
          Logan hits the floor hard, the impact blasting a small crater
          in the concrete.
          Creed manages a rolling fall, cat-quick and dexterous.

          The lids of ten thousand isolation tanks slide open. As the
          camera roams among the Eleven, needles and hoses detach from
          their bodies, releasing their metallic grip.
          The cloned Creeds begin to stir in their stainless steel
          coffins.

          Creed pounces on Logan, who is still severely injured from
          the fall. Creed tears into the smaller man mercilessly,
          slinging him around the cavern, gouging him with his black
          talons.
          Creed batters Logan with a series of savage blows. Logan
          falls, his healing factor overwhelmed, barely conscious.
          Creed plants one heavy black boot on Logan's face and presses
          down hard. He leers at his defeated foe.

          cannot be contained, a rage so vast it could only be called
          berserker.
          .Logan rolls toward his tormentor, sweeping his claws straight
          through Creed's ankle, severing the foot.
          Creed screams and falls to his knees.

          The uppermost section shears off and drills into the floor
          with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the concrete for
          thirty feet around the impact site.
          Stryker realizes what Logan is doing.

          Logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it. Creaks
          and groans sound overhead, as the tremendous weight above
          exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports.
          Most of the ten thousand can't get close to Logan, but they
          all want in on the first kill.
          Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle
          of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood
          of the Eleven.
          He reaches a third pillar and chops through it.
          Kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit.
          STRYKER (cont'd)

          STOP HIM, YOU IDIOTS! STOP HIM!
          Even Logan can't hold back the tide for long. Talons rake his
          face, his arms, his chest. But still he battles, slicing
          through a fourth pillar, a fifth.
          Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling. Dust and rocks
          fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen.
          Logan sees that the cavern's collapse is imminent. He can no
          longer hold off the Eleven's assault.
          An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using
          his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars
          with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree.
          One of the clones follows, using his black talons in the same
          fashion, grabbing at Logan's feet.
          When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing
          clones, he severs the pillar below his feet. The clone
          chasing him can climb no farther, can do nothing but roar and
          hiss at his escaping prey.
          Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla
          waits beside the open door. He races up the stairs.
          Stryker sees his dream in ruins. He runs for the nearest
          exit.
          Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety,
          when the cavern ceiling gives out. Thousands of tons of stone
          and steel come crashing down.
          Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before
          she would be crushed.

          The compound has essentially imploded, the major structures
          falling into the massive pit created by the cavern's
          collapse.
          Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater
          into a raging fire pit. Smoke billows up from the molten
          core.
          A few dazed survivors, SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS, have escaped
          the carnage, but Alkali Lake no longer exists as a military
          base. Thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind.
          Logan and Kayla walk away from the burning crater, never
          looking back. They head through the woods toward the lake
          that glitters in the sunlight.

          have already healed. She strokes his jaw. and smiles sadly.
          One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her
          leg. She takes it and looks down at the blank page.
          She has no pen. She touches her chest, just above her heart,
          wetting her finger with her blood.
          She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it,
          folds it once and places it in Logan's hand.
