1.   ARRAKIS - A SCENE FROM SPACE

     Also known as DUNE, home of the Fremen, former
     Zenzunni wanderers.

1A.  INT. ROCK LEDGE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     BLACK

     FADE IN to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of
     the REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO, who sits against smooth
     black rock. Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and
     her skin is a haunting translucent white. Her voice
     ECHOES as if in a great cavern.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe.

           RESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES
               Bi-la kaifa.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe. We know
               of spice...the spice called melange...the
               greatest treasure in the Universe. It
               exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis,
               Dune. We know of spice and the Bene
               Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding
               plan of ninety generations to produce the
               Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will
               awaken.

           RESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES
               Bi-la kaifa.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               And now the prophecy...

     Silence...then a powerful low organ NOTE resounding
     in the cavernous space.

            REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D)
               He will come...the voice from the outer
               world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad,
               which will cleanse the Universe and bring
               us out of darkness. He will have been born
               of a Bene Gesserit mother.
--
     The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the
     Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ
     BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice.

     The picture FADES.

1B.  KAITAIN - A SCENE FROM SPACE

     Home planet of House Corrino and Shadam IV, Emperor
     of the known universe.

2.   INT. DROP - NIGHT

     FADE IN to:

     ...interior of one drop of water. The image changes
     subtly.

2A.  EXT. - DROP - NIGHT

     PULL BACK to a shot revealing the outside of the
     drop. There is a distant ROARING and within the drop
     we can see the distorted image of a space ship
     landing on a sophisticated landing field.

3.   (Deleted)

3A. EXT. LANDING FIELD - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     On the dark landing field, chemicals spill out of
     the ship in troughs and tank-suited Guildsmen begin
     to swarm out of a hatch opening.

4. through 6.  (Deleted)

7.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in
     his Throne Room.

     Suddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and
     quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND
     begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly
     begin to clear the large room. Several women are
     rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman,
     IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring
     look to her father, the Emperor.

                         IRULAN
               Father.
--
                         EMPEROR
               Irulan.

     She sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him
     now, speaking to him. Irulan turns and leaves. The
     Emperor moves away from his officers to the center
     of the now-empty room. He drops his golden robe from
     his shoulders. He stands in his elegant black
     uniform, thinking.

     The Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar
     Officers leave her alone with the Emperor.

                         EMPEROR
                    (quickly)
               A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here
               within minutes!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We felt his presence.

                         EMPEROR
               I shall want telepathy during his visit
               and a report when we're finished.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Their minds are so.... They move in
               strange directions....

                         EMPEROR
               Yes?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Forced spice evolution of humans changes
               many things.... I must sit close to him.

                         EMPEROR
               He will not permit anyone but me to see
               him. You must be outside this room.... Do
               what you can.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I am your Truthsayer, my lord...
                    (sensing something outside the room)
               He is here, my lord.

     Under the carved inscription "Law is the Ultimate
     Science", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide
     open and FIFTY GUILDSMEN wheel in a forty-foot long
     giant black box. One of the Guildsmen addresses the
     Emperor through a translating device.

                   TANKED GUILDSMEN #1
               The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.
--
     The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother.

                         EMPEROR
               Leave us.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Yes, my Lord.

                         EMPEROR
                    (after she has gone)
               We are alone...

8.   INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a
     seat on a chair just outside the door. She closes
     her eyes.

9.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Inside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED
     GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a "V"
     formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens,
     slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass
     tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR
     twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty,
     pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper.

     The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas,
     and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic
     chemical spills dripping from under the tank.
     Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the
     Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a
     huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep
     blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an
     intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the
     tank translates into English and broadcasts it into
     the room.

                        NAVIGATOR
               We have just folded space from Ix...

                         EMPEROR
                    (extremely nervous)
               Yes?... How was your journey?

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (after a long pause)
               Many machines on Ix... new machines.

                         EMPEROR
               Oh yes?
--
                        NAVIGATOR
               Better than those on Richesse.. You are
               transparent... I see many things... I see
               plans within plans.

                         EMPEROR
               Is there a problem?... Usually there is a
               problem when one of you makes a visit.

     No answer.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (finally)
               The answer is within the problem...

10.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother
     sits, her eyes closed, straining.

11.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     A very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild
     Navigator. She is not getting the English version
     but a much different language version which is
     fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song
     monologue.

12.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                        NAVIGATOR
               I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides,
               House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you
               behind it.

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

     The Navigator breathes the spice-gas heavily and
     swishes gently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               You must share with us.
--
                         EMPEROR
               The Atreides house is building a secret
               army!... using a technique unknown to
               us... a technique involving sound. The
               Duke is becoming more popular in the
               Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I
               have ordered House Atreides to occupy
               Arrakis to mine the spice... thus
               replacing their enemies the Harkonnens....
               House Atreides will not refuse because of
               the tremendous power they think they will
               gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron
               Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and
               launch a sneak attack on House Atreides...
               I have promised the Baron five legions of
               my Sardaukar terror troops.

                        NAVIGATOR
               So the Harkonnens will rid you of House
               Atreides...

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

13.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene
     mentally. She suddenly sees and flinches.

14.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     The Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very
     close to her. We hear the Navigator speak to her.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (to Reverend Mother, mentally)
               Reverend Mother... I will give you the
               Tleilaxu Path.

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
                    (an excited whisper)
               A chance for escape? But for whom?

15.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                         EMPEROR
               Can you hear me?... If this visit has
               anything to do with spice...
--
     The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite
     violently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the
               spice has given me accelerated evolution
               for four thousand years... it has enabled
               you to live two hundred years... the spice
               helps make the sapho juice, which gives
               the red-lipped mentats the ability to be
               living computers... the secret side of
               spice... the water of life.

16.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE  - NIGHT

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               He shouldn't speak of this...

15.  BACK TO SCENE

                        NAVIGATOR
               ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the
               metaphysical ability to see beyond...to
               have superior powers... Our power to fold
               space is in the spice... Without us, your
               empire would be lost on isolated scattered
               planets... You would be lost.

                         EMPEROR
               I can assure you...

                        NAVIGATOR
               Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly
               of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...

16.  BACK TO SCENE

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               Here it comes...

17.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                        NAVIGATOR
               We ourselves... foresee a slight problem
               within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul
               Atreides.

                         EMPEROR
               You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides...
               his father.

24.  EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     High on the rock cliff stands Castle Caladan, Its
     appearance us dark and medieval. There is a window
     on the seaward wall lit from within...

25.  INT. TRAINING ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     ...by a drifting glowglobe. Paul sits at an L-shaped
     table studying filmbooks and maps of Arrakis and the
     Universe.

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     We SEE vast star fields and galaxies.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               Here we are now... nineteen light years
               beyond...

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     We SEE the galaxies move as we HEAR a HUM.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (whispering)
               ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.

     We HOLD on this, then we see Arrakis grow larger in
     the filmbook screen and we SEE it is a planet of
     vast deserts.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
                    (whispering again)
               It does look dry....

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     The picture grows larger again, and we see the
     Arrakeen Valley.

                     FILMBOOK (V.O.)
               Each day the palms along the outer wall of
               the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough
               water to sustain the lives of one hundred
               men. The palms were placed by the
               Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in
               front of the city Fremen.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Where are the Harkonnens from here?

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     The star fields and galaxies move slightly then.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (whispering)
               There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron
               Harkonnen... the enemy.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

     In the background, FOOTSTEPS grow louder, pounding
     on thick wooden floors. THUFIR HAWAT, GURNEY HALLECK
     and DR. YUEH enter. Paul has his back to the door.
     Thufir suddenly looks perturbed when he notices
     this.

                          PAUL
                    (without turning)
               I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back
               to the door.

     Hawat suppresses a smile.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming
               down the hall.

                         THUFIR
               Those sounds could be imitated.

                          PAUL
               I'd know the difference.

     Paul rises and turns to face them.
--
                         THUFIR
                    (inner voice)
               Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

                          PAUL
               My father sent you to test me. Music then?

     Thufir scowls.

                         GURNEY
               No music. I'm packing this for the
               crossing. Shield practice.

                          PAUL
               Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice
               -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.

                         GURNEY
                    (angered)
               Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for
               cattle and love play... not fighting.

                          PAUL
               I'm sorry Gurney.

                         GURNEY
               Not sorry enough.

     Gurney draws his knife.

25B. SHIELD EFFECT - THE FIGHT

     Gurney activates his body shield, sending a
     shimmering FORCE FIELD around his body. He advances
     swiftly toward Paul. Paul snaps on his FORCE FIELD,
     draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself
     hurriedly for the fight.

                         GURNEY
                    (his voice sounding strange through
                    the forcefield)
               Guard yourself for true!

     Gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious
     attack. Paul falls back. The shield edges CRACK
     loudly as they touch each other.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What's gotten into Gurney? He's not
               faking.
     Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly
     around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger
     as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul
     directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney
     against the table, plunging at just the right moment
     to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade
     right at Gurney's neck.

                          PAUL
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Is this what you seek?

                         GURNEY
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Good... the slow blade penetrates the
               shield... but look down.

     Paul looks and sees Gurney's blade at his groin.

                     GURNEY (CONT'D)
               We'd have joined each other in death.
               However, you did seem to finally get the
               "mood".

                          PAUL
               Would you really have drawn my blood?

                         GURNEY
               If you'd fought one whit below your
               abilities I'd have scratched you a good
               one.

     Paul stands and snaps off his shield as does Gurney.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Things have been so serious here lately.

                         GURNEY
               Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but
               this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we
               leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The
               Harkonnens are real.

     Thufir, Yueh, Gurney and Paul stare at each other
     for a moment in silence. Dr. Yueh moves forward and
     begins to take Paul's pulse rate and to collect
     other data with a small black machine.

                          PAUL
               Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on
               the worms of Arrakis?
--
                        DR. YUEH
               I have obtained a filmbook on a small
               specimen... only 125 meters long.

                          PAUL
               Only?!

     They smile at each other.

                        DR. YUEH
               There are have been documented sightings
               of worms as large as 450 meters in the
               deep desert -- far from where we'll be in
               Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south
               polar regions are marked forbidden....
               Why?

                          PAUL
               The storms and the worms. Is it true, that
               the sand can blow at seven hundred
               kilometers per hour?

                          YUEH
               It can render flesh to dust in minutes.
               And these dry winds can generate
               tremendous static electricity in the
               atmosphere. Our body shields won't have
               enough power to operate in the open air on
               Arrakis.

                          PAUL
               Well, how do the Fremen survive there?

                          YUEH
               We don't know much about the Fremen...
               They live in the deep desert... some of
               them in the cities and they have blue-
               within-blue eyes...

                          PAUL
                    (smiling)
               The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the
               blood by the spice -- melange. Could the
               spice affect us in other ways?

                         THUFIR
               Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we
               know the Harkonnens would not have given
               up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

                          PAUL
                    (rising)
               The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but
               behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.
--
                         THUFIR
               You will make a formidable Duke!

     Paul bows.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Now remember... the first step in avoiding
               a trap is knowing of its existence.

                          PAUL
               I know.  But if it is a trap then why are
               we going?

                         THUFIR
               We have our new army.
                    (in the same breath)
               Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.

     Thufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end
     of the training room, calls out to them.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Clear and lock the room.

     Gurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS
     above each doorway.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Activate a fighter.

25C. ROBOT FIGHT

     Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling.
     As the robot begins to rotate and go through several
     frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places
     a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it
     around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box.
     Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound
     through the weirding module as he rushes towards the
     robot.

                         GURNEY
                    (to Yueh)
               Precise control....

26.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     The hallway is empty in the foreground but in the
     distance a changing of the guard is seen.

26A. through 26B.   (Deleted)

27.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks down the stairway.  In the distance,
     moving troops are packing Atreides belongings.
     Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large
     bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried
     blood.

                          PAUL
               The bull that killed my grandfather... is
               this an evil omen?

     Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant
     black head.

                          PAUL
                    (happily)
               Duncan!

                         DUNCAN
               Paul.
                    (they shake hands)
               I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I
               have to go on ahead.

                          PAUL
               Why?  I wish you were coming with us.

                         DUNCAN
               It's something for your father.  He wants
               to talk to you.
                    (places hand on Paul's chest)
               I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of
               God be with you.

                          PAUL
               May the hand of God be with us all,
               Duncan.

28.  EXT. CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks to meet his father near the wall.

                          PAUL
                    (diffident)
               Father.

                        DUKE LETO
               Thank you for joining me, Paul.
                    (voice tired)
               It will be good to get to our new home and
               have all this upset behind us.

28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA

     They look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes
     below.

     The Duke turns to Paul.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               My son.
                    (out loud)
               Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
               three generations....  He swears you are
               the finest student he's ever taught.
               Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same....
               It makes me feel very proud...

                          PAUL
               I want you to be proud of me.

     Paul smiles up at his father.  The WIND blows the
     Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the
     green and black Atreides banner against the night
     sky beyond.  The RAIN starts again -- lightly.  Paul
     takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in
     the wind.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (studying the dark sea below)
               I'll miss the sea... but a person needs
               new experiences... they jar something deep
               inside, allowing him to grow.  Without
               change, something sleeps inside us... and
               seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.

     Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he
     sees the Duke's signet ring.  Again he smiles at his
     father.

                                                FADE TO:

29. through 29A.    (Deleted)

30.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul is sweating during his sleep and WHISPERS as if
     struggling with some disturbing thought.
--
                          PAUL
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert
               Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet...
               moving... moving.

31.  DARK WATER - MENTAL IMAGE

     We see Paul's dream. It is very dark.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     Suddenly a drop falls into the black, and white hot
     widening rings appear on the dark water's surface.

     Darkness again. Two moons rise in the darkness. As
     the second appears:

                          VOICE
               The second moon, your moon...

31A. INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Dark again. A figure turns toward Paul. It is a
     BEAUTIFUL GIRL in deep shadow. She speaks.

                     BEAUTIFUL GIRL
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

32.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     CU Paul's face in fitful sleep.

33.  EXT. COURTYARD - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     In a small stone courtyard, the back-lit figure of a
     woman moves towards us through the heavy RAIN and
     darkness. As she nears us, the large, protective
     glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a
     beautiful woman -- JESSICA.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               I  know she has come to test him... no man
               has ever been tested with the box... only
               Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.

     The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius
     Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes
     her back toward the Castle. The rain rushes loudly
     into the storm drains.
--
34.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (whispering again)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet...
               moving... moving.

     CU Paul's face.

     Paul's eyes snap open. He hears footsteps outside
     his door. As the door opens he closes his eyes,
     however, and he pretends to be asleep. Jessica and
     the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway
     looking at him.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We'll salvage what we can... but I can
               tell you.. dear God... for the father...
               nothing.

     Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned! She
     turns back to look at Paul. Her hands tremble.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               Did you really think that you could bear
               the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               My greatest student... and my greatest
               disappointment.... He's awake!... He's
               listening to us.
                    (considering)
               Good... Ready yourself, young Paul
               Atreides... I want to see you in your
               mother's chamber in one quarter of an
               hour.

     She turns and walks away. Jessica remains at the
     door and calls out to Paul in the darkness.

                         JESSICA
               Paul?... This is very important...

     Jessica leaves, closing the door behind her. Paul
     sits up in bed.

                          PAUL
               Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father...
               nothing?

35.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Jessica and the Reverend Mother enter. It is quite
     dark. Jessica WHISPERS a code number and a glowglobe
     LIGHTS on a very dim setting.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (angrily)
               Jessica... You were told to bear only
               daughters to the Atreides... Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               It meant so much to him...

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You thought only of a Duke's desire for a
               son?... Desires don't figure in this! An
               Atreides daughter could have been wed to a
               Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We
               may lose both blood lines now.

                         JESSICA
               I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll
               pay for my own mistakes.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               And your son will pay with you.

42.  INT. DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Under a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on
     a scroll-like piece of paper.

     Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a
     cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red
     hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which
     seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING.

     He pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE
     COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He
     leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside
     the window.

     FADE TO:

35.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul enters the room and Jessica closes the door
     behind them.

                         JESSICA
               Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius
               Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe
               you...
                    (to Reverend Mother)
               Please...
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Jessica, you know it must be done. I
               enjoin you to stand guard at the door and
               practice the meditation of peace.

                         JESSICA
               Your Reverence.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What does she fear?
                    (out loud)
               What about my Father?

                         JESSICA
               Paul... please, Paul... listen to the
               Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

     Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks
     to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training
     which permits an adept to control others merely by
     selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if
     two people are talking -- one normal and the other
     gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is
     strange, yet subtle.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (using The Voice)
               Now you come here.

     Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he
     fights her controlling him.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               She's using The Voice.
                    (out loud)
               No.

     She sees him struggling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (inner voice)
               Some strength there. Surprising!
                    (out loud)
               Come here.

     The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               See this... Put your right hand in the
               box.

     Paul stares at the hole in the box.
--
                          PAUL
               What's in the box?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Pain.

     Just then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul
     sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               STOP! Put your hand in the box.

     Paul's hand goes in. Fear passes over his face.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The Voice again.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't
               pull away or you'll feel that poison. A
               Duke's son must know about many poisons --
               this one kills only animals.

                          PAUL
               Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an
               animal?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Let us say I suggest you may be human.
               Your awareness may be powerful enough to
               control your instincts. Your instincts
               will be to remove your hand from the box.
               If you do so you will die. You will feel
               an itching -- there... see? Now the
               itching becomes burning... heat, upon
               heat, upon heat.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               It burns.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               SILENCE... SILENCE.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(struggling to compose
                    himself)
               I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.
               Fear is the little death that brings total
               obliteration. I will face my fear... I
               will permit it to pass over me and through
               me.

     The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her
     ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches
     away breathes hotly. She is smiling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You feel the flesh crisping?

36.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     Paul's inner mind sees his hand on fire with all
     sorts of sores. The skin is bubbling.

37.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Flesh dropping off.

38.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     He pictures this. The destruction of his hand is
     complete -- now only blood spurts out and burns.

39.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul's face registers extreme pain.

                          PAUL
                    (cannot help the explosion)
               THE PAIN!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child
               ever withstood that much. I must have
               wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of
               the box and look at it, young human.... Do
               it!

     Paul pulls his hand out of the box. No sign of
     anything wrong. He turns his hand, flexes his
     fingers. He looks to the Reverend Mother.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (explaining)
               Pain by nerve induction... A human can
               resist any pain. Our test is crisis and
               observation.

                          PAUL
               I see the truth of it.

                    (inner voice)
               Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will
               he be ours to control?
                    (out loud)
               You know when people speak the truth?

                          PAUL
               I know it.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother holds her hand against
     Paul's head. She closes her eyes.

40.  INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE

     She sees a blurred image of Paul's earlier dream.
     She sees the beautiful girl turn. She hears a
     muffled voice say "Tell me of your homeworld, Usul".

41.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Your mother wants you to tell me about
               your dreams. I only want to know one
               thing.... Do they come true?

                          PAUL
               Not all of them... I know which ones will.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

                          PAUL
               What is it?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (profoundly)
               The person who can be many places at
               once... the one who bridges space and
               time.... He will look where we cannot.

                          PAUL
               Where?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Do you know of the Water of Life?... the
               Truthsayer drug?

                          PAUL
               I have heard of it.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               It is very dangerous... very painful. The
               Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see
               within.... There is a place terrifying to
               us... to women. It is said a man will
               come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go
               where we cannot... Many men have tried...

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died....
                    (she calls out loudly)
               Jessica!

     Jessica enters immediately and sees with great
     relief that Paul is still active.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the
               regular order of training. His safety
               requires The Voice.

                          PAUL
               I've heard enough of my safety... What
               about my father?... I heard you talking.
               You speak as if he was dead. Well, he
               isn't!

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She tries to hold him.

                          PAUL
               Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell
               me he won't die!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               What can be done has been done.

                          PAUL
               MOTHER! Tell me!

     The Reverend Mother covers herself and moves quickly
     to the door.

     HOME PLANET OF HOUSE HARKONNEN - As seen from space,
     the black planet as we saw it in Paul's filmbook.

47.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The surface of the planet is a vast sea of black
     oil. A small cable car traverses high above the sea
     toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a
     rectangular box over 100 stories high. Before the
     city there are rows of huge black towering steel
     heads atop massive furnaces. SMOKE billows out of
     their mouths.

48.  INT. CABLE CAR - GIEDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the cable car stands PITER. In one hand he
     holds the cylinder with DUKE Leto's ring imprint.

                          PITER
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.
               It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts
               acquire speed -
               The lips acquire stains -
               The stains become a warning -
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.

48A. INT. GREEN PORCELAIN ROOM - GEIDI PRIME

     Somewhere in the interior of Geidi Prime, we are in
     a green porcelain room. Two large Harkonnen
     soldiers, using large hoses, are washing down the
     walls and floors of the room. WE MOVE DOWN into the
     water rushing along the floor towards troughs.
     Closer, WE SEE bits of flesh, hair, and blood.

49.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The car zooms past gigantic faces, and the furnaces
     far below ROAR with tremendous power. The city now
     looms gigantic and overpowering -- millions of
     electrical cables stretch off the top into dark
     energy taps above the city.

50.  INT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the city the cable car passes into a huge
     inner chamber filled with open-topped lime green
     porcelain rooms with tremendous electrical lines
     criss-crossing above.

52.  INT. BARON'S ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     In front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops
     and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and
     enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being
     treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body.
     The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the
     Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and
     sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some
     time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room.

                          PITER
               My Lord!

                          BARON
               Piter.

     Piter moves up to the Baron.

                          PITER
               The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon,
               Baron, and I have here your answer from
               Duke Leto.

                          BARON
               What does Leto say, Piter?

                          PITER
               He wishes to inform you that Vendetta --
               as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,
               the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He
               does not wish to meet or speak with you.

                          BARON
                    (swallowing; angry)
               I made my peace gesture... the forms of
               Kanly have been obeyed.

     He throws down the cylinder.

                          PITER
               As you instructed me, I have enlightened
               your nephews concerning my plan t...
--
                          BARON
               My plan!

                          PITER
               The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd,
               Rabban... go quietly... no other great
               house of the Landsraad must ever know of
               the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The
               entire Landsraad would turn against the
               Baron and the Emperor.

                         DOCTOR
               Put the pick in there Pete
               And turn it round real neat.

     His assistant does so.

     Rabban breaks open a squood (living food).  The
     squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the
     blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty
     container of tiny animal meat into the dark water
     trough running through the center of the room.
     Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter,
     holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white
     pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who
     is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to
     arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall
     opposite the Baron.

                          BARON
                    (as the Baron watches the boy)
               You're so beautiful my Baron
               Your skin, love to me
               Your diseases lovingly cared for
               For all eternity.

                          BARON
               I will have Arrakis back for myself... he
               who controls the Spice, controls the
               universe... and what Piter didn't tell you
               is we have control of someone who is very
               close to Duke Leto.  This person... this
               traitor... will be worth more to us than
               ten legions of Sardaukar.

                          FEYD
               Who is the traitor?

                          BARON
                    (laughs)
               I won't tell you who the traitor is or
               when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will
               die before these eyes and he'll know that
               it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who
               encompasses his doom.
--
     The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the
     wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the
     Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet
     in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats
     down under the giant, humming electrical tube light
     and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which
     drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink
     glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The
     Attendants stand completely still with fear.

     The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands
     petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as
     they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins
     SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug,
     located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped
     and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then
     the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS
     continue to roar.

     Jessica mount the steel stairs to their ship.  In
     the doorway, they turn back for a final look.

     The Duke places a hand on Paul's shoulder.  We see
     the signet ring.  Jessica is there.  She tries to
     get Paul to look at her but he scowls and turns to
     his father.

                         JESSICA

     other in the silence which follows.

57.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     We pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot
     high control room filled with orange spice gas. On
     the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and
     filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being
     converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of
     machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a
     Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims
     through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional
     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe.
     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his
     mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and
     changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The
     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light
     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe.
     It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator
     begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the
     stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into
     the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins
     to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical
     lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the
     Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges
     deep into the light. The navigator swims to the
     point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull
     and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks
     and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a
     roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this
     hole through the rings of light. The Navigator
     becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost
     in darkness. The sounds fade.

     reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside
     them.

                        DR. YUEH
               Listen here.... You can here the people of
               Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry
               "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?

                         JESSICA
               So many reminders of the scarcity of
               water.

                        DR. YUEH
               Have you noticed the line of palms along
               the wall... the Harkonnen put them in...
               to flaunt their water wealth in front of
               these people.... Each day those palms take
               enough water to sustain the life of one
               hundred men.

                         JESSICA
               The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know
               you had so much reason to hate them.

                        DR. YUEH
                    (swiftly)
               My wife... you didn't know my wife...
               they...

                         JESSICA
                    (out loud)
               Forgive me...
                    (inner voice)
               ... His wife was Bene Gesserit too... the
               signs are al over him.... They must have
               killed here.

     Jessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on Yueh's
     cheek.

                        DR. YUEH
               I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.

     Above them a series of iron curtains begins to open
     over deep rock window slots, sending  narrow shafts
     of light down across the room. TWO ATREIDES WOMEN in
     uniform approach.

                    ATREIDES WOMAN #1
                    (referring to several robed figures
                    standing in the room)
               My lady... the local people... the maids
               and servants await your inspection. Hawat
               has cleared them.

     Dr. Yueh turns to Jessica.

                        DR. YUEH
               The Harkonnens may have tampered
               medically.... please wait.

     He turns a yellow light on a moves it over the
     crowd. The yellow light beam plays over the blue-
     within-blue eyes. One of the women, the Shadout
     Mapes, watches Jessica continuously. Yueh's hand
     shakes slightly.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands)
               He's hiding something -- holding something
               back.
                    (She studies his face closely.)
               It's not just his wife... He's a good man
               though. He's probably trying to save my
               feelings...
                    (We see her mouth.)
               I could use The Voice... make him tell
               me... It would only shame him.
                    (We see her eyes.)
               I must place more trust in my friends.
                    (We see Yueh turn toward her,
                    fearful.)

77.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul wanders through the darkened passageways alone,
     his footsteps echoing as goes. He takes pleasure
     observing the details of the rock Palace but all the
     while he feels an uneasiness -- a feeling of fear
     builds in him.

78.  INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul enters a small bedroom and sits down on the
     bed. He opens the filmbook, and activates it.

78A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     We SEE a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice
     harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a
     narrator speaks over.

                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One carryall handles four spice mining
               teams; however, it will fly only two
               harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine
               hundred and thirty harvesters and nine
               hundred and eighty-one carryalls....

78.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul looks up. Across the room he sees a tray of
     small pastries which have been laid out. He goes to
     them and scans them with his poison detector, which
     he carries on his belt. A pleasant tone SOUNDS and
     the word "safe" appears in green light. Paul takes a
     pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed.
     Suddenly he stops. He looks at the pastry.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Spice...

     As he continues eating he notices the sunlight
     through the slates over the window begins to GLOW
     white hot. Paul's eyes are intense as the light
     GLOWS brilliantly.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (whispering inner voice)
               Terrible purpose.... What is it?

78B. INSERT - RED DROPLETS

     Some red droplets appear rushing through the white
     light. Three images follow:

               A Fremen... Could she be the operator?
               No...

                      SHADOUT MAPES
               I must cleanse the way between us.... You
               saved my life... and we  Fremen pay our
               debts. It's known to us that you've a
               traitor in your midst. Who it is we cannot
               say but we're certain of it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A traitor...

     Before he can speak the Shadout Mapes is gone --
     running off down the passageway. Jessica enters.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (looks to Jessica)
               There is a traitor among us.

               Set up a sonar probe immediately!

83.  INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Dr. Yueh sticks his head out the doorway as SEVERAL
     TROOPERS run past.

84.  INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Duke Leto is calling on a radio phone. GENERALS
     surround him, as well as Gurney.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (on phone)
               Thufir?... anything?... keep looking.
                    (Inner voice)
               ...and a traitor... God help us.

85.  INT. SUB-SUB-SUB-BASEMENT - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     TROOPS come off an elevator. The glow-span indicates
     the very bottom floor of 18 sub-floors. The ground
     is uneven rock and the ceiling is low. The troops
     fan out shining chemical lamps here and there. A
     soldier suddenly stops. Ahead in his light is a dead
     Harkonnen -- bloody vomit dried around his mouth. He
     lies beside an electronic device.

86.  INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Dr. Yueh covers his face with his hands in a
     darkened room... sobbing.

86A. EXT. WALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     SEARCHLIGHTS sweep over the faces of City Fremen who
     are sitting or moving solemnly around the outer wall
     of the Palace. Some are chanting "Mahdi" and "Lisan
     al-Gaib." Others hold up one open hand as a sign
     they feel the messiah is near. A slow-moving spike-
     backed dog sucks ants up out of a small anthill; he
     snorts.

86B. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     In the darkened Hall we can HEAR the distant sound
     of the Fremen reverberating.

87.  INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Duke Leto sits with Paul, Thufir, EIGHT GENERALS and
     SIX SUB-LIEUTENANTS. The Duke's small dog wanders
     under the table and rests his head on the Duke's
     boot. In front of Thufir is a device FLASHING
     brilliant light bursts over his face. The others are
     all talking among themselves. Suddenly Thufir's face
     turns brilliant red (as red as his sapho-stained
     lips) and he begins speaking rapidly into the
     machine in code using a strained high voice.
--
                         THUFIR
                    (Mentat voice)
               Sector 6 - 80 -- copy the sixth -- the
               summit -- the eight the quadrant over the
               ninth plus eighty -- four circles -- weave
               the eighty and call the fourth copy --
               enter nine -- seven by seven a seven the
               seven call seven B seven -- enter the
               circles call the sixth copy the sixth over
               the summit.... eight.

     The machine FLASHES several bright irregular
     SIGNALS. Then it stops and HUMS. The blood leaves
     Thufir's face.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
                    (very fast and casually)
               Eight.... Thufir Hawat... Mentat... Master
               of Assassins.

     The hum stops. Thufir turns to Duke Leto. He looks
     up. Everyone is quiet now.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               The Palace is now secure. The city of
               Arrakeen is under martial law... we have
               troops here headquartered underground on
               sub-floors six through ten. The rest of
               the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and
               we have some on the airfield. Our new army
               is still training, but everything is
               shielded.... With the shielding, we are
               impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire,
               for your inspection of spice mining
               operations, but since the attempt of the
               young master, I am against your leaving
               the Palace.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (very angry)
               The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives
               have already been taken. We must crush the
               Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all
               know what to do.
                    (Turning towards Gurney)
               ...Gurney! We desperately need more spice
               miners... many are threatening to leave on
               the next shuttle. We need spice drivers,
               weather scanners, dune men ... any with
               open sand experience. You must persuade
               them to enlist with us.

                         GURNEY
               They shall come all for violence: their
               faces shall sup as the east wind. And they
               shall gather the captivity of the sand.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (squints at Gurney)
               Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and
               take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I
               arrive. We will not be prisoners here in
               this place.

                         GURNEY
                    (artfully easing the Duke's anger)
               Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I
               forth to my work.

     Gurney strides off. Thufir sits, contemplating. Paul
     and Duke Leto smile at each other and shake their
     heads.

88.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Jessica is sitting in a small room, smiling, reading

     Outside in the passageway, feet suddenly move
     quietly toward the door to Jessica's room.

92.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Jessica HEARS this and looks up just as the Shadout
     Mapes silently enters her room.

                         JESSICA
                    (staring at the blue-eyed woman --
                    waiting for possible danger.)
               Yes?

                      SHADOUT MAPES
               I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper,
               Noble Born. What are your orders.

                         JESSICA
               You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not
               noble born. I'm the bound concubine of
               Duke Leto -- mother of the heir
               designate.... "Shadout"... that's an
               ancient word.

                          MAPES
                    (strangely asked)
               You know the ancient tongues?

                         JESSICA
               I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all
               the hunting languages.

                          MAPES
               As the legend says.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has
               been here planting protective legends
               against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And
               that day has come. I must play out this
               sham.
                    (out loud)
               I know the Dark things and the way of the
               Great Mother. Miseces prejin.

     Mapes takes a step backward to flee.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
               I know many things. I know you came
               prepared for violence with a weapon in
               your bodice.
--
                          MAPES
               My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a
               gift if you should prove to be the one.

                         JESSICA
               And the means of my death should I prove
               otherwise.
                    (inner voice)
               Now we will see which way the decision
               tips.

     Slowly Mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a
     sheathed knife. She unleashes it.

                          MAPES
               Do you know this my lady?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               It could only be one thing....
                    (out loud)
               It's a crysknife.

                          MAPES
               Say it not lightly...
                    (very slowly)
               Do you know its meaning?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Here is why this Fremen has taken service
               with me, to ask that one question. Delay
               is as dangerous as the wrong answer.
               Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa
               is... maker of death.
                    (out loud)
               It's a maker...

     Mapes SCREAMS with elation and grief.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               Maker?... Maker is the key word... the
               tooth of the worm? That was close...
                    (out loud)
               Did you think that I, knowing the
               mysteries of the Great Mother, would not
               know the maker?

                          MAPES
               My lady, when one has lived with prophecy
               for so long, the moment of revelation is a
               shock.

     Mapes sheathes the blade... slowly
--
                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               There's more here... yes!
                    (out loud)
               Mapes, you've sheathed that blade
               unblooded.

     With a GASP Mapes drops the knife into Jessica's
     hands and opens her blouse.

                          MAPES
               Take the water of my life!

     Jessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and,
     with the blade, scratches a line just above Mapes'
     right breast.

                     MAPES (CONT'D)
               You are ours.... You are the one.

     Jessica's eyes stare ahead. She knows these words
     ring with truth.

     The Duke, Paul and SEVERAL ARMED GUARDS enter a
     tunnel to a `thopter landing pad which is
     illuminated by a shaft of light coming from a
     chimney-like exit above. DR. KYNES and his Fremen
     guard are standing next to Gurney.

                          KYNES
                    (to Gurney)
               So, this is Leto the Just...

                         GURNEY
                    (sharply)
               I hope I made myself clear. You may call
               him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And
               there is a more ancient term you might
               keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               Play out your little comedy while you can
               off-worlders...

     Gurney turns and activates a device...

93A. INSERT - ORNITHOPTER OPENING

     ...which causes the ornithopter behind to fold open
     ready for flight.
--
93B. INT. TUNNEL - OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
DAY

     The two parties meet and are introduced.

                        DUKE LETO
               So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial
               Ecologist?

                          KYNES
                    (turning to Gurney)
               I prefer the more ancient term,
               planetologist... Noble Born.

                        DUKE LETO
               This is my son, Paul.

                          PAUL
               Are you a Fremen?

                          KYNES
               I am a servant of the His Majesty the
               Emperor. I have served His Majesty on
               Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               He's hiding something.

                        DUKE LETO
               I understand we have you to thank for
               these stillsuits, Doctor.

                          KYNES
               They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit
               well, my lord.

                          PAUL
               "Your gift is a blessing of the river."

     Kynes' FREMEN GUARDS, hearing this are siezed with
     agitation. Kynes QUIETS them, then studies Paul.

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               The Mahdi will greet you with holy words
               and your gifts will be a blessing.
                    (spoken, nonchalantly)
               Most of the desert natives here are a
               superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With
               your permission, I will check the security
               of your suits.

     Gurney and the guard move forward warily.

                         GURNEY
                    (angrily)
               The Duke is to be addresses as...
--
     Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit,
     checking seals and pulling on straps.

                          KYNES
               Basically...

                         GURNEY
                    (leaping forward to protect his Duke)
               Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               It's all right Gurney.

     Gurney steps back.

                         GURNEY
               Yes, Sire.

                          KYNES
               It's a high-efficiency filter and heat
               exchange system. Perspiration passes
               through the first layer and is gathered in
               the second. The salt is separated.
               Breathing and walking provide the pumping
               action. The reclaimed water circulates to
               catchpockets from which you can drink
               through this tube at your neck. Urine and
               feces are processed in the thigh pads.
               Should you be in the open desert, remember
               to breathe in through your mouth, out
               through the nose tubes.

     The Duke is now properly fitted. Kynes places the
     noseplug into his nose.

                     KYNES (CONT'D)
               With a Fremen suit in good working order,
               one can sustain life for weeks, even in
               the deep desert.

     He removes the noseplug.

                        DUKE LETO
               My thanks.

                          KYNES
               With your permission...

     Kynes turns to Paul, running his hands over the
     slick fabric. He stands back with a puzzled
     expression.
--
                          KYNES
               You've worn a stillsuit before?

                          PAUL
               No.

                          KYNES
     Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how
     to do that?

                          PAUL
               No one. It... seemed the proper way.

                          KYNES
               That it is.
                    (inner voice)
               He shall know your ways as if born to
               them.

     Kyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely
     now.

                         GURNEY
               We're wasting time, Sire.

     Duke Leto, Dr. Kynes, Gurney and Paul enter the
     ornithopter...

               Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's
               where I told your sandmaster to
               concentrate his harvesting.

95.  EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     They crest the top of the wall which opens out into
     a black, level expanse of rock, cratered and
     fractured. On the other side is the huge, seemingly
     endless plain of sand, the Great Desert. In the hazy
     distance, flashes of light can be seen.

96.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                          PAUL
               Will we see a worm?

                          KYNES
               Where there is spice and spice mining
               there are always worms.

                          PAUL
               Always?

                          KYNES
               Always.

                          PAUL
               Why do they come?

                          KYNES
               To protect their territory. Vibrations
               attract them.
--
                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I've registered him now... a knife is a
               sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a
               person born to command... He's hiding many
               things.
                    (out loud, suddenly)
               Is there a relationship between the worms
               and the spice?

     Kynes turns instantly and stares at Paul. Gurney
     sees the wonder in Kynes' eyes.

                         GURNEY
               The young master is a trained Mentat, an
               advanced student of Prana Bindu has
               studied under some of the finest teachers
               in the Universe.

     Kynes takes a second look at young Paul.

                          KYNES
               As I said... they defend the spice sands.
               As to their relationship with the spice...
               who knows.

               Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

                          KYNES
               That's it... spice mining... no other
               cloud quite like it. See the spotters over
               it? They're watching for wormsign... the
               telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the
               surface, too Sire... worms can travel too
               deep for their waves to show... Looks like
               a good patch of spice.

                        DUKE LETO
               Wormsign? Is it wormsign?
--
                          KYNES
               Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp
               eyes Sire.... May I?

     Kynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct
     frequency.

98A. through 99.    (Deleted)

100. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER

     From the window, we see that the sand below is
     rippling, like water with a big fish just under the
     surface.

                          KYNES
                    (into radio, after having found the
                    frequency)
               Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign!

          STATIC... then a voice.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Who calls Pad Nine?

                         GURNEY
                    (quickly)
               Don't mention the Duke... This is an
               uncoded channel.

                          KYNES
               Unlisted flight northeast of you...
               wormsign on intercept course... estimated
               contact fifteen minutes.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix.
               Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very
               precise estimate. Who is on that unlisted
               flight?

     Kynes clicks off the radio.

                        DUKE LETO
               What happens now?

                          KYNES
               The carryall will come and lift off the
               spice harvester. Try and get in close over
               the harvester... you'll find this
               interesting Sire.
--
     The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the
     direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...

101. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     ...huge amounts of sand being spewn out of the
     gigantic stack atop the metal and plasteel
     harvester.

102. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                          KYNES
               They'll work until the very last minute.

     The yellow cloud of the harvester envelops them. The
     Duke flies up to get a closer look.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Spotter control... no sign of the
               carryall... it isn't answering.

     Everyone looks at one another.

                         GURNEY
               The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Spotter control -- give me a report by the
               numbers.

     Over the radio MANY VOICES report they have no
     contact with the carryall.

                        DUKE LETO
               Damn it... Harkonnens.

     He punches a control button and grabs a microphone.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (into microphone)
               We are coming down to take you off the
               harvester... All spotters are ordered to
               comply.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)

                        DUKE LETO
                    (angrily)
               Duke Leto Atreides....

     Gurney and Paul turn to each other, worried.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Yes... yes, Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               How many men do you have?

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire,
               we can't leave this spice...

                        DUKE LETO
               Damn the spice! Get out of there.

103. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     All the spotters begin landing and the Duke descends
     directly in front of the harvester which has stopped
     mining yet emits a tremendous rythmic GRINDING
     noise. No one is coming out.

104. INT./EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER/DESERT - DAY

     Gurney nervously scans the sky for enemy ships. A
     very low, powerful SOUND starts now and the ground
     begins to shake.

105. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     A hatch opens and MEN come pouring out.

106. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - DAY

                        DUKE LETO
                    (yelling at the men)
               Two men in each of the spotters... You!...
               over here... run!!

     The ground is really shaking now.  A tremendous low
     THUNDERING sound grows along with a high rasping
     HISS.

                          KYNES
                    (to Paul and Gurney -- yelling over
                    the noise)
               I can't see him yet but he's very close...
--
                        DUKE LETO
                    (out loud to himself as he watches
                    the men scrambling)
               Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy.

     FOUR MEN begin tumbling into the Duke's machine.

                         GURNEY
               Come on boys... come on.
                    (Then, to the Duke)
               We're going to be heavy, Sire.

     The men press on Gurney and Paul.  Paul can feel the
     fear. The sound is a horrible ROAR and deeper
     RUMBLING now and the `thopter is vibrating and
     shaking violently.  The air suddenly begins to SPARK
     with static electricity.

                          KYNES
                    (nervous)
               Here he is... We've got to go.

     The Duke closes the doorways, surveys the area one
     last time, then takes the controls.

106A.     INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     The ship strains and lifts off -- slowly.

     Paul sees the brown powder clumped on the suits of
     the men... their bluish eyes.  He smells the spice.
     He begins to feel its affect.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice as a blinding light
                    comes and goes)
               Spice!... pure un-refined spice!

                          KYNES
                    (murmuring)
               Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the
               coming and going of him.  May his passage
               cleanse the world.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (yelling)
               What's that you're saying?

                          KYNES
               Nothing.

     A spice miner turns and sees Kynes, who remains
     silent.
--
                     SPICE MINER #1
                    (astonished)
               Liet!

                     SPICE MINER #2
               Shhhhh.

     Paul hears this, then looks to Kynes -- locks on his
     image.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Liet?

                          KYNES

     Paul looks down as the Duke banks over the
     harvester.

107. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

Static electricity is IGNITING in the air and the sand is
swirling around the harvester.  Then they see it.  A wide
hole emerges from the sand, glistening spokes within it.
The hole is twice the size of the harvester.  Suddenly
the machine turns and slides into the hole, parts of it
EXPLODING.  The SOUND is deafening.  The Duke's ship is
WHINING to stay aloft.

     Duke Leto walks into the room.  The NIGHT GUARD
     comes to attention as he passes.  DUNCAN IDAHO,
     wearing a dark, dusty stillsuit, emerges from the
     shadows.  DUKE LETO and DUNCAN meet at the foot of
     the steps.  The men embrace and separate.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (happily)
               Duncan!  What have you discovered about
               the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why
               haven't we heard from you?

                         DUNCAN
               My lord... I suspect so much.  I think
               they are the allies we seek... they are
               strong and fierce... they do not give
               their loyalty easily or quickly....  As
               you know, the Imperium has never been able
               to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone
               thinks that there are but few -- wandering
               here and there in the desert.... My lord,
               I suspect an incredible secret has been
               kept on this planet... that the Fremen
               exist in vast numbers... vast numbers...
               and it is they that control Arrakis.

     The BARON's face --  expressionless.  The SOUND of
     his ship screams in the background.  The DOCTOR is
     seated beside him.

118  INT. SUB-BASEMENT PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
NIGHT

     The Duke walks down the steps to a very narrow
     passageway.  The passageway becomes very dark.

     Suddenly the Duke hears a strange MEWLING sound.  He
     turns down an even darker passageway.  He can hear
     the shield WHINING in the distance.  He almost has
     to feel his way.  Up ahead he sees a shape.  He
     bends down and sees the SHADOUT MAPES dying on the
     cold stone floor in the darkness.  She tries to
     speak but cannot.  She falls.  Suddenly the Duke
     HEARS the shield generator start whining down.

                        DUKE LETO
               What happened?  What?
                    (as Mapes dies)
               The shield!

     The Duke reaches to activate his shield be a large
     dart is shot into his shoulder.  The Duke lurches
     upwards then tumbles to the ground.  Out of the
     darkness comes Dr. Yueh.  The dart drops and
     CLATTERS as if a dream.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (mind racing -- struggling)
               Yueh!

                          YUEH
               I wish to kill a man... not you, my dear
               Duke, but the Baron....  You were dead
               already... but you will be close to the
               Baron before you die.  You will be tied
               and drugged but you can still attack.
               When you see the Baron you will have a new
               poison tooth.  He will want you close so
               he can gloat over you.  One bite on this
               tooth and a strong exile...

                        DUKE LETO
               Refuse...

                          YUEH
               No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will
               save the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

     Yueh removes the Duke's signet ring and shows it to
     him.

                      YUEH (CONT'D)
               For Paul...

     He implants the tooth.

     Yueh becomes more and more blurred.  His image
     begins to fade.  His lips move in the darkness.  The
     generator WHINE is low and going lower and lower.

                      YUEH (CONT'D)

     battle.  Gurney and a squad of TROOPERS climb
     through bodies and thick smoke.  Gurney has the
     Duke's dog safely inside his coat.  The little dog's
     head sticks out -- looking about.  Gurney strokes

     Suddenly twelve huge Sardaukar round a corner on a
     quick march.  Duncan turns his shield up and charges
     them.  Behind them he sees Paul and Jessica bound in
     straps and being carried.

     Duncan attacks and fights valiantly but he is
     outnumbered.  In the fight the lights are blown out

     Piter moves to Yueh, a knife glistening in his hand.
     It flashes into his back.  A GASP escapes Yueh's

     say "I thought as much."  He stands stiffly, then
     falls gasping.  He tastes his own blood, then dies.

     The distant FIRES play over Jessica's face as she
     sees Yueh's triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin

     He turns and hits Paul in the shoulder with a
     stungun.  Paul recovers and starts taking long,
     calming breaths.

     up Jessica's skirt.  He starts breathing hard.  Paul
     clears his throat.

               Excellent!

     Guard #1 finds himself removing Jessica's gag.
     Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems
     powerless to stop him.  Once, it's off Jessica
     smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter
     floor.

     The two men stare at one another a moment.  Then
     Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard
     #2's chest, killing him.  Guard #1 pulls the knife
     out, smiling.  The ornithopter begins to veer off
     into a dangerous nose dive.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1

                         JESSICA
                    (The Voice)
               First cut my son's bonds.
--
     Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking
     his eyes off Jessica.  The ornithopter gets closer
     and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield
     Wall.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               That's it.

     The blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's
     legs.  Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and
     his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and
     drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out
     the man's mouth.  Paul grabs the controls but it's
     too late.  The ship falls into the rock.

130A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter slides across the rock, shearing off a
     wing.  Suddenly they are beyond the rock three miles
     above the great desert and plummeting fast toward
     the dunes below.

130. BACK TO SCENE

     Paul pulls desperately on the controls and manages
     to keep the ship aloft and flying into the deep
     desert.

                         JESSICA
               Oh, my God!

131B.     EXT. PALACE - ARRAKEEN - NIGHT

     CU violently burning palm.

133. BACK TO SCENE

     Nefud exits - TWO HARKONNENS wheel in the stretcher,
     and swing it round - one of the GUARDS hands Piter
     his knife back - the Guards exit and the door closes
     - Piter moves up to Duke Leto and leans over him
     moving his knife across the Duke's face.

     The Baron flies down to the stretcher.

                          BARON
               Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the
               insignia off your uniform.  Such
               carelessness.

     Leto shows no sign that he has heard.
--
                          PITER
               It was Feyd.

     Leto's POV:  The Baron and his Mentat are only DIM
     FARAWAY SHAPES.  Their voices reach Leto as if
     travelling across a greater distance.  The Baron
     looks to Leto and then moves to him, looking him
     over.

                          BARON
               It was Feyd?
                    (laughing)
               It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet
               ring?  I must have his ring.

                          PITER
               The ring?... he was brought to us as is,
               Baron.  I...

                          BARON
               You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

                        DUKE LETO
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh... Yueh... dead... Paul and Jessica
               safe... the tooth!

                          PITER
               He's coming round, my Lord.

     The Baron moves from behind a table stacked with
     dirty dishes and foodstuffs and goes to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (inner voice)
               Wait... he must be near...

                          BARON
               Where is your ring?

     The Baron's face is now very close to Duke Leto's.

                     BARON (CONT'D)
               You do not answer!

                        DUKE LETO
                    (very faint)
               A... little... closer....  The... water...
               of my life... for Paul.

     The Baron briefly wonders at these words and then
     turns to Piter.
--
                          BARON
               He's crying!
                    (he hits Duke Leto)
               He's crying!  He's crying, Piter.  What
               does he mean?

     Piter moves forward.  The Baron sees a suculent
     piece of chicken skin on the table.  He picks up the
     plate, then the chicken skin.

     Leto's POV:  It's grown HAZY again.  The Baron is
     beginning to move away, reaching for the small piece
     of chicken skin.  Piter leans close to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
               Now!

     We hear a CRUNCH, hear a tumultuous RUSHING SOUND as
     Piter's face is pushed forcibly away.  The Baron is
     turning, a dumbfounded look on his face.  He drops
     the plate, and backs away.

     There is a tremendous ROARING.  Bits of visions of
     Caladan rush through Leto's ever-darkening
     consciousness --

     MENTAL IMAGES:

134. through 134A.  (Deleted)

134B.     EXT. CLIFF WALL - CALADAN - DAY

     The Atreides banner, the green of it, then the
     black.  The blackness flaps; then all fades to
     SILENCE.

135. INT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - NIGHT

     As they fly deeper into the desert with the ship
     shuddering and straining, Jessica suddenly cries out
     with tremendous premonition and fear.

                         JESSICA
               Leto!  Leto!

     Tears course down her cheeks as Paul turns to her.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (to Paul)
               Leto!  He's dead!  He's dead...

               I have NO FEELINGS!!  Why?

136. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     Duke Leto and Piter lie dead.

137. INT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     The Baron floats near the ceiling in a small
     passageway.  He is ecstatic.

                          BARON
                    (screaming)
               I'm alive!!!  I'm alive!!!

137A.     INT. HARKONNEN `THOPTER - NIGHT

     Paul is fighting the controls of the Harkonnen
     `thopter.

137B.     CLEAN POV

     Harkonnen `thopter lights on dunes.

137A.     BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               I can't maintain any altitude... we'll
               never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe
               that small rock.

                         JESSICA
               Where are we do you think?

                          PAUL
               The South Polar regions... the forbidden
               area.  We must make it to that rock...

137C.     EXT. HARKONNEN `THOPTER - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter violently hits the sands and flips up -
     - almost turning over.  It falls slowly back,  then
     slides down the side of a dune.
--
137D.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
               Hurry!

     He jumps out of his seat.

                         JESSICA
               Bring these satchels!

     She hands him one.

                          PAUL
                    (at doorway)
               Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm.

     As Paul puts the satchel over his shoulder, he feels
     something.  He looks at his father's ring.  He
     stares at it silently, then closes his hand around
     it.  They jump outside.

                         JESSICA
                    (starting to cry)
               A million deaths are not enough for

                    (inner voice)(reacting to his
                    mother's tears)
               Where are my feelings... I feel for no
               one...

138. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica running.  Paul pulls Jessica to a
     place in the wall where a small overhang offers
     shelter.  Jessica falls to the ground.  She CRIES,
     pouring out her grief, but soon the sound of it is
     carried away by the building rush of WIND.  Paul
     turns and looks out to the open desert, this portion
     of which is a dust ocean.

138A.     PAUL'S POV:

     The Mouse Moon has risen.

     Ripples of dust undulate tide-like in the light of
     the moon.  The WHISPERING grains billow up like the
     foam of waves as they hit the rock.

138. BACK TO SCENE

     Paul turns, his face illuminated by the two moons
     above.  His eyes lock on the moon which has the
     image of the mouse.

               The second moon... from the dreams...

138B.     INT. PAUL'S EYE - NIGHT

     We move into Paul's eye, where the mouse moon appear
     and revolves slowly.  The moon begins to explode.
     The pieces of the moon soar toward us burning with
     white-hot flames.  Within the flames we see...

139. (Deleted)

139A.     EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     ... the burning Palace of Arrakeen.  We move closer
     to it.

189B.     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     We then see Duke Leto's face.  The Baron leans over
     the Duke and clutches the skin on the Duke's face.
     He begins pulling it.  The skin on the Duke's race
     slowly rips open -- making a hideous tearing SOUND.
     Black SMOKE issues forth from the hole which teats
     larger.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (distorted)
               House Atreides is ruined.
                    (less distorted)
               This moon holds my past.

139C.     INT. VESTIBULE - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Inside and through the SMOKE Paul sees Feyd tear the
     Red Duke insignia off his father's uniform.  He sees
     Feyd laughing.  The moving, now-brilliant red hawk
     insignia becomes...

139D.     EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     ... a burning meteor ROARING over the castle on
     Caladan.  The meteor crashes in the black sea.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               This moon holds my future.
--
139E.     INT. WATER - NIGHT

     Foaming confusion turning into a small, twisting
     fetus under the sea.  Its eyes closed.  Moving close
     to it, its eyes snap open.  Through the eyes is the
     pale white face of JESSICA.

139F.     EXT. SHIELD WALL - DESERT - NIGHT

     There is a huge soaring WIND sound and beyond
     JESSICA the dunes roll like ocean waves.

139G.     EXT. MOUSE MOON - NIGHT

     The moon continues to spew out pieces of moving
     images which are seen then disappear as fast as
     sparks.  The broken, burning pieces float eerily
     toward us over the undulating dunes below.  One
     image floats closer.  It is a hand folded into a
     fist.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               I am only a seed...

     The fist begins to open.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The seed must grow.

     The hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating
     out the very center of the palm.  The hand floats
     eerily forward.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The sleeper must awaken.

139H.     EXT. WATER - NIGHT

     The last image which passes is foaming and spitting
     dark blue water.  As the image passes, the black
     smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to
     blackness.

140. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Through the darkness we move to Paul's clenched
     hand.  It opens, revealing the signet ring in the
     very center of his palm.  Paul looks upward to the
     moons of Arrakis.  He looks back to the ring, then
     to his mother.

                          PAUL
               Listen to me!... you wanted to know about
               my dreams... and I've just had a waking
               dream... do you know why?...

                          PAUL
               The spice!  It's in everything here.  The
               air, the soil, the food...  It's like the
               Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!!
               You knew the spice would change me.  But
               thanks to your teachings it's changed my
               consciousness.  I can see it... I can see
               it.

                    (inner voice)
               He knows.

                          PAUL
               You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood...
               I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm
               something different, something unexpected!

142B.     EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul's head goes down.  He places the ring on his
     finger.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Father... now I have become a killer and I
               will continue to kill until I have avenged
               your death.

145. BACK TO SCENE

     Rabban stops up the ramp.  He wears a large smile.
     His thick head sweats and sweat runs down his thick
     neck.  He goes inside and the doors swing closed.

146. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     He enters the ship and moves down within to the
     Baron's headquarters, passing two dwarves cooking a
     dead legless cow which hangs from chains.  Rabban
     tears out the cow's tongue and eats it.  Then he
     exits through a door which closes behind him.

147. INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     The Baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of
     a large steel shower, while Nefud and a DWARF play a
     strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse,
     screaming MUSIC.  The Baron SEES Rabban enter, but
     continues to fly around the shower.

                          BARON
                    (very excited)
               Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides
               blood!  We've gutted them.  We've gutted
               them!
                    (laughs)

     The Baron floats to Rabban and begins lovingly
     massaging Rabban's massive neck as he speaks to him.

                          BARON
               Rabban, Rabban...  I place you in charge
               of Arrakis.  It's yours to squeeze, as I
               promised.  I want you to squeeze and
               squeeze and squeeze.
                    (massaging in rhythm)
               Give me spice!  Drive them into utter
               submission.  You must not show the
               slightest pity or mercy... as only you
               can...  Never stop!
                    (releasing him)
               Go....  Show no mercy!

                         RABBAN
               Yes, my lord Baron.

     Rabban leaves just as Feyd steps out of the shower.
     The Baron turns to him lovingly.
--
                          BARON
                    (to Feyd)
               And when we've crushed these people enough
               I'll send in you Feyd... they'll cheer you
               as a rescuer... lovely Feyd... really a
               lovely boy.
                    (suddenly he smiles and screams)
               Where's my doctor?

148. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     As Rabban leaves, he looks into one room of the
     ship.  Behind the glass porthole sits Thufir Hawat
     bound head and foot, his eyes darting this way and
     that.

148A.     EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica are in stillsuits.  Paul is looking
     through a Fremkit.  He finds a paper with Dr. Yueh's
     mark on it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh's left the plans for the weirding
               modules.

148B.     EXT. MOONS - ARRAKEEN - DESERT - NIGHT

     The moons have moved further across the sky.

148A.     BACK TO SCENE

     Suddenly Paul turns and studies his mother.  A
     stronger WIND comes up.

                          PAUL
               We have to get to that mountain of rock.
               We have entered the time when all will
               turn against us and seek our lives...

     Jessica gets up.  They make their way up the crest
     of a dune by a small rock.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               It's further than I thought... a worm is
               sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper,
               that should divert it.
--
     Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica
     SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of
     rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)(as Paul leaves to light
                    the thumper)

     Paul plants the thumper which begins a powerful

               Remember... walk without rhythm and we
               won't attract a worm... it'll go to the
               thumper.

                         JESSICA
                    (puts in her noseplug)
               I'm ready.

     Paul and Jessica move into camera and exit right.

151B.     EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT

     Another burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems
     to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to
     ache.  Suddenly they HEAR the thumper start behind
     them.

                          PAUL
               Keep going...

152. EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER)

     Their breathing becomes very labored.  The sand
     moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up.
     Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS
     shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops.
     Paul turns.

                          PAUL
               Faster!!
--
                         JESSICA
                    (screaming)
               It's deafening!

     Their bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet
     the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm
     SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look.

153. EXT. WORM - DESERT - NIGHT

     A flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward
     them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous
     and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed.
     The power of this worm is awesome.

153A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (screaming)
               Run!

                         JESSICA
               I can't... I can't.

     She turns to see.  Then she runs.

153B.     EXT. DRUM SAND - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand.
     The SOUND is very loud.

                          PAUL
               Drum sand!

     The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground.
     Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They
     run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud.
     Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white
     LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they
     find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm
     changes.  They turn.

154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking
     through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an
     eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth
     arches forward searching for them.

155. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow
     slit of rock.
--
155A.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot
     penetrate the narrow opening in the rock.

156. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of
     hundred feet.

156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     Still the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the
     worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS
     drive through the black stone.  Over and over again
     the worm mindlessly hits at the rock.

156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny
     passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock
     prevents them from moving back any more.

156C.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     The breath from the worm is like a hurricane of
     WIND.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Cinnamon... the spice!
                    (out loud)
               Do you smell it?

                         JESSICA
               Yes...

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I know the secret.  The worm is the
               spice... the spice is the worm.

157. (Deleted)

157A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Suddenly a colossal section of the rock wall cracks
     and topples off into the worm's mouth.  Instantly
     the worm pulls back.  A huge FIRE roars deep within
     the worm consuming the rock.
--
158. INT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm now can get even closer to Paul and
     Jessica.  It looms up again and crushes its mouth up
     against the rock.

158A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Another fissure opens, and suddenly half the rock
     wall protecting them splits off entirely and
     falls... taking Paul with it.

158B.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     ...against the worm.

159. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight
     down two hundred feet.  His feet skid along the face
     of rock.  He bounces and brakes.  He hits and jumps.
     He careens from one boulder, flies upside down,
     rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand.
     Unhurt, he jumps up and scrambles up another part of
     the rock to safety.

160. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She presses against the narrow ledge that is left
     after the worm assault.

161. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm is just coming up again when distant
     THUMPING is heard.  The worm, as if charmed by the
     sound, turns and moves off towards it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A thumper.

161A.     (Deleted)

162. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Jessica climbs further up and manages to get over to
     a place where she can meet up with Paul, who is now
     climbing back.
--
                         JESSICA
                    (crying)
               What's happened?...  Why did it leave?

                          PAUL
                    (breathing heavily)
               Someone started another thumper....  We're
               not alone.

     They climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth
     of a dark crevice.  Paul and Jessica try to see into
     the inky black hole.

163. EXT. CREVICE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Slowly Paul and Jessica enter, inching forward.  A
     low moan of WIND comes up.  Paul can see nothing,
     then suddenly he SEES stars above and SEES the hint
     of stairs cut into the rock.

                         JESSICA
                    (whispering)
               Man-carved steps.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               Yes...

     They climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow
     dark channel of stone.  As they make their way
     through the rock, suddenly there is a burst of
     lightning which illuminates a whole troop of Fremen
     standing silently in front of them.

164. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
               Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us
               of.

                         STILGAR
                    (to Jessica)
               Are you trained in the ways of the desert?

                         JESSICA
               No, but many consider my training
               valuable.

                         STILGAR
               I will take the boy-man... he shall have
               sanctuary in my tribe...
--
     A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the
     Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and
     just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon,
     Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls
     again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar
     helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat.
     Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky
     incline.

165. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     He then jumps higher up and presses himself between
     two rocks on a low cliff overlooking the rest of the
     Fremen troop.

166. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The troop starts shooting projectile weapons in
     Paul's direction.

                         STILGAR
               Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding
               way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great
               gods... if you can do this to the
               strongest of us you're worth ten times
               your weight of water.  As a leader of my
               people I give you my bond: teach us this
               weirding way and you both shall have
               sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with
               our water.

                         JESSICA
               Then I will teach you our way of
               battle....  you have the word bond of a
               Bene Gesserit.

                        A FREMEN
               It is the legend.

167. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Up on the rock, Paul turns.  He takes a step, then
     notices a small figure standing in front of him.  It
     is a girl.

                          CHANI
               I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would
               not have permitted you to harm my tribe.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet....
               is this Kynes' daughter?

     Paul stares at her in wonder.
--
                          CHANI
               Come with me.  I'll show you an easier way
               down.

     They exit.

168. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
                    (to Paul, as they meet)
               You have strength... real strength... You
               shall be known as Usul, which is the
               strength of the base of the pillar.  This
               is your secret name in our troop.  But you
               must choose the name of manhood which we
               will call you openly.

                          PAUL
                    (thinking)
               What do you call the mouse shadow in the
               second moon?

                         STILGAR
               We call that one Muad'dib.

                          PAUL
               Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?

                         STILGAR
               You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother
               shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We
               welcome you.

     Wind blows a cloud of dust through the rock.  High
     above the moon with the mouse shadow glows
     brilliantly.  It dissolves into the sun.

168A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Paul, Jessica and the Fremen march through the
     dunes.

171. through 171B.  (Deleted)

172. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DUSK/SUNSET

     HEAT WAVES and sand dunes.  Mysterious SOUNDS echo
     in the distance as the giant sun is setting.

     Chani takes Paul to the top of a dune.  They stare
     at the sunset and a huge rock outcropping in the
     distance.
--
                          CHANI
               Seitch Tabr.

     Paul looks at the rock, then turns to her.

                     CHANI (CONT'D)
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

     These words rend Paul's soul.  He cannot speak.  He
     reaches out and touches her hand - her cheek.

174. INT. ENTRANCE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The Fremen troop enters into a large square room
     with slot passageways going off in various
     directions.

175. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     They all move down one of the passageways which are
     beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns.  They
     are like passages in the pyramids, dark with sharp
     turns and inclines upwards or downwards, some very
     steep and long, and others descending hundreds of
     feet.  There is a strong, moaning WIND.

176. through 177.   (Deleted)

178. INT. PASSAGEWAY/STAIRS - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A quiet WIND can be heard -- deep and moaning.

                         JESSICA
               Moisture...

     She looks at Paul.  He, too, notices.

                          PAUL
               Wind traps... huge ones.

     Down a long, sloping, narrow passageway they go
     until they reach a stairway cut into the stone.  It
     is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they
     descend.  The WIND sound grows.  The air grows
     colder and damper.  Paul and Jessica share another
     questioning look.  At the bottom of the stairs they
     pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly
     opens out on something so totally unexpected it
     shocks Paul.
--
179. INT. RESERVOIR  -SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     It is enormous, deep reservoir of black water
     sitting silently in the depths of this sietch and
     stretching out into the darkness.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Water on Arrakis!!!
               I have seen this place in a dream.
                    (out loud)
               A treasure.

                         STILGAR
               Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have
               thousands of such caches.  Only a few of
               us know them all.  When we have enough...
               we shall change the face of Arrakis.
               Listen!...

     There is the sound of water dripping.  The lights
     are extinguished - reflections play on Paul's face.

                    STILGAR (CONT'D)
               The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets.

179A. through 180   (Deleted)

180A.     REVISED SCENE - HALL OF RITES

     Thousands of Fremen wait below.  Paul enters a rock
     ledge, guided by two monks, which is crowded with
     Fremen and old Fremen Monks.  Below the crowds
     continue to watch and wait while a giant wind organ
     moans.  A Monk steps up to Paul.

                          MONK
               We sense that you may be the "voice from
               the outer world".  Both moons told us of
               you.  You must pass tests before we will
               know... you must conquer the beast of the
               desert, both his outer and his deadly
               inner powers.
                    (moves back)
               Speak to us... from the outer world.

     Paul turns and gathers courage to address the
     multitude below.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I am only a seed.
                    (out loud)
               I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib.
--
                         CROWDS
                    (loud murmur)
               Muad'dib!

                          MONK
               The legend.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               No one ever dreamed there would be so
               many.
                    (out loud)
               Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once
               again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar,
               your leader, has asked me and my mother to
               crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more
               than this.  We must totally destroy all
               spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild
               and the entire universe depends on spice.

               "He who can destroy a thing, controls a
               thing".

               I will take one hundred of your warriors
               and train them.  This one hundred will
               train the thousands that remain.  When the
               spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to
               Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor
               himself will be forced to deal with us.
               Arrakis will become the center of the
               Universe.
                    (inner voice)

182. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - DAY

     Large room with a low ceiling.  A drummer playing
     makes a low ECHOING MUSICAL HIT.  A big block of
     stone is moved across coarse sand -- back and forth
     -- fast.  A rhythm is started -- powerful.  Paul
     enters, pauses and looks to Jessica - he stands in
     front of over 100 Fremen men.  Jessica sits behind
     him alongside Stilgar.

     A large rock obelisk has been placed near Paul for
     this demonstration.

                          PAUL
               The weirding way has long been a Bene
               Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help,
               my father isolated an element of the
               weirding way and externalised it.
--
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
               Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my
               father's armies were never able to fully
               develop this new form.  This is what I
               will teach you.  You will be the fiercest
               and most feared fighters in the Universe.

               Our way of battle is built on rhythm.  You
               understand rhythm like this but you do not
               yet understand the rhythm of the higher
               sounds, sounds that heal and build...
               sounds that destroy.  Motion is the base.
               You understand the motion... but you do
               not yet understand the motion that heals
               and builds... motions that destroy...

               Orato!
                    (he moves forward)
               This obelisk is of your hardest stone.
               Kick it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Hit it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Yell at it...

                          ORATO
               Break!

     The Fremen laugh -- the rock doesn't move.

     A Fremen with a lasgun tries to cut it.  Paul
     motions him back, slightly.

                          PAUL
               Move back!

     Paul also moves back.  He switches on his weirding
     module.  He opens his mouth and makes a small SOUND,
     which the module amplifies.

                          PAUL
               Chuksa!

     The sound shatters the obelisk to pieces.  The one
     hundred Fremen YELL with surprise and awe.

                       100 FREMEN
               Achiii!

               This is part of the weirding way that we
               will teach you.  Some thoughts have a
               certain sound... that being the equivalent
               to a form.  Through sound and motion you
               will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter
               bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or
               burst his organs....  We will kill until
               no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

                       100 FREMEN

               To avenge my father, I will turn you into
               killing machines.

     Stilgar turns to Jessica.

                         STILGAR
               Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me
               she is too old... She has been calling
               through space and time for you to come and
               let her rest.  She asks that you pass
               within.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               They want me to take the Water of Life...
               the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous,
               yet... we must move swiftly if we're to
               secure our place among these Fremen.
                    (out loud)
               I will try to pass within.

                         STILGAR
               Death may be the result....  Are you sure?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               I must do this for Paul, but what of my
               unborn child?

188. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Fremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in
     on a litter.  The old Reverend Mother is old a frail
     yet extremely beautiful and mysterious.  She turns
     to Paul and Jessica with a strange look.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
                    (to Jessica, in an ancient voice)
               So you are the ones.

     She turns away towards the monks who are very busy
     blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice,
     purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow
     on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting
     chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low
     notes below.

     Paul looks to his mother.

     He then sees Chani.

     CU Chani.

     CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her.

     Stilgar motions to Paul.

                         STILGAR
                    (whispering to Paul)
               Do you know the Water of Life?... Come...
               ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries...
               the end and the beginning.

     He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost
     a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through
     an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very
     strange and somewhat horrifying scene.

189. INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a
     stone chamber.  The chamber is then covered with a
     wire top.  Valves are turned and water rushes into
     the chamber.  The worm begins to writhe violently
     and leap and bang against the bars above.  The worm
     begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it
     begins to gag.  Some monks and watermasters quickly
     drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out
     using large steel hooks.  They hold the worm above a
     large tub.  A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed
     in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a
     beautiful deep blue bile as it dies.

189A.     INT. MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial
     containers.  Paul turns to Stilgar.
--
                         STILGAR
               The Water of Life.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The most lethal poison in the Universe.

     Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation
     with the Reverend Mother:

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               ... Many men have tried.

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died.

190. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Stilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall
     of Rites.  A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses
     the crowd, silencing them.  The other monks move
     back carrying their smoking cleansing bags.

                         MONK #1
               One among us has consented to enter the
               rite.  She will attempt to pass within
               that we not lose the strength of our
               Reverend Mother.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(turning to his mother)
               What if she should fail?

     He brings the jug close to Jessica.

                         MONK #1
               Drink!

     Jessica drinks.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic.
               I must transform the poison configuration
               within my body... the blue must be made
               clean.

     She swallows.  Her body contorts and spasms
     violently.  She screams.  The Reverend Mother
     screams with her.

     We see Jessica sitting, shoulders tight and spasming
     -- straining, her eyelids half-closed and
     flickering.

194. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The old Reverend Mother slowly extends a hand toward
     Jessica's shoulder.

195. JESSICA - MENTAL IMAGE

     Inside Jessica, we see the Reverend Mother Ramallo's
     hand descend through the dark void.  Shimmering
     water starts to ripple, lightly stirring an image of
     Jessica.

     As the hand penetrates, something deep within her
     starts to GLOW.  It is a fetus, a female.  The
     Reverend Mother Ramallo's hand flinches as it
     touches the fetus.  The fetus sparks to life -
     screaming and rapidly spasming upwards on its
     umbilical cord.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
                    (whispering urgently into Jessica's
                    ear)
               You should have told us.

197. JESSICA'S MENTAL IMAGE - FETUS

             REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (V.O.)
                    (gasping)
               Great Mother!  This changes both!  What
               have we done?
--
197A.     INT. THE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     Jessica and the fetus rush mentally through a dark
     strangely worm-like tunnel until suddenly, a gaping
     black hole appears.  A horrible WIND, SPARKS and
     circles of expanding light issues from it.

                      JESSICA (V.O)
                    (inner voice)(fearful)
               No!  This is the place where we cannot
               look.  The place only for the eyes of the
               Kwisatz Haderach.

197B.     THE FETUS - NIGHT

     The fetus twists down the tunnel to join Jessica,
     her umbilical cord trailing behind.  She SCREAMS as
     she looks into the hole.

197C.     THE NAVIGATOR - NIGHT

     She and Jessica see a shape moving deep within the
     windy hole.  It is a Third Stage Navigator, ROARING.

                         JESSICA
               What is this?...  Is this what kills the
               men who enter here?

     She quickly takes the fetus back up the tunnel.  As
     they move:

                 JESSICA (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               Now my daughter and I are both Reverend
               Mothers.

             REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (V.O.)
                    (distant)
               I've been a long time waiting for you.
               Here is my life.

198. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The old Reverend Mother Ramallo slumps forward onto
     the stone, dead.  The crowd waits.  The corpse is
     tenderly removed.  Jessica very slowly opens her
     eyes and looks about her.  The monk holds the jug to
     her lips.

                          MONK
               Change it that we may all drink of it.
--
     Jessica spews water into the spout.  The monk swirls
     the jug, sniffs at the spout and then drinks.

                      MONK (CONT'D)
               It is changed!

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               She did it!

199. INT. HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The Fremen suddenly turn their attention to Paul....
     They whisper "It is the prophecy!"  They soon begin
     to CHANT... "Muad'dib....  Muad'dib" over and over
     again.  The chanting sounds fill the hall along with
     the ghostly wind organ.

     Paul continues to stare at Chani.  He moves to her.
     Chani turns.  Paul is at her side.  Their eyes meet
     and lock.

                          CHANI
                    (whispering)
               Come with me.

203. INT. PASSAGEWAY ON ROCK LEDGE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     At the end of the dark black corridor, Chani turns
     and she and Paul fall together in a long kiss filled
     with love.

                          PAUL
               Chani....  I love you... I've always loved

169. INT. STAIRCASE - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The Baron and Feyd descend several steps into a
     darker area of Geidi Prime.  Feyd is carrying a
     strange creature in a small wire cage.  The Baron is
     floating as he descends.

                          BARON
                    (takes a drink)
               Feyd, even though he's aging, Thufir is
               one of the finest Mentats in the
               Universe... and he's mine, Feyd... all
               mine....  Quiet now.

                          FEYD
               I will.

170. INT. BASEMENT ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     Nefud stands eating candies behind Thufir's chair.
     Nefud has a stun gun, even though Thufir's hands are
     tied.  The Baron enters with Feyd.

                          BARON
               Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your
               heart plug already....  Don't be angry.
               Everyone gets one here.  But this is not
               why we're here.  We've brought you a
               little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it
               if you wish to live.  A poison has been
               introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By
               milking this smooth little cat body each
               day you receive your antidote... it must
               be done each day....  Also, you must do
               something for me if you wish to live.  You
               know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat...

     Thufir gives the Baron a weak, wide-eyed stare.

                          FEYD
               All I can see is an Atreides that I want
               to kill.

                          BARON
               Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now,
               aren't you Thufir?

                         THUFIR
                    (inner voice)
               My dear Duke... how I have failed you.

211. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Jessica's face shows signs of straining.  Women move
     around her, Chani and Harah at her side, helping her
     give birth.  Suddenly ALIA is born and her freshly-
     born moist body is held up in front of Jessica.
     Alia's eyes snap open, burning brightly.

                          HARAH
               What will you call her?

                         JESSICA
               Alia.

     As they lift Alia for Jessica to see...

                          ALIA
               Mother.

210. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Paul walks down the steps into the training room -
     followed by Harah's two sons.  He pauses at the foot
     of the steps.

                          PAUL
               Activate your weirding modules...

     Paul activates his, and the Fremens follow suit.

                          PAUL
               Set the range for two meters.

     Paul walks down the line of Fremen.

               Korba...

                          KORBA
               Chuuuk-sa...

     He fires the module and the arm of the robot is shot
     off.  Paul smiles and hits him on the shoulder -
     Paul walks on.

     One of the FREMEN calls out to Paul.

                        A FREMEN
               Muad'dib!...

     The word `Muad'dib' causes a tremendous power to
     build.  The module shakes violently in his hand - it
     suddenly fires upwards, and the wall explodes.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               My own name is a killing word.  Will it be

               Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest
               fighters to serve you as your guard... the
               Fedaykin.

     He pauses, then holds up his brilliantly red hand.

213. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     An EXPLOSION.  Paul turns and his eyes are totally
     blue.  He lifts binoculars to them and looks.  He
     sees the Fremen fighters below charging at the
     Harkonnens.  As the Fremen run they make powerful
     SOUNDS with their weirding modules, exploding
     everything in their path and catching things on
     fire.

213A.     EXT. CARRYALL - DESERT - DAY

     In the distance, a huge spice carryall is shot down
     and it falls to the ground EXPLODING more violently
     on impact.

                    (to Stilgar)
               They're even better on the battlefield

                    (inner voice)
               Sound... as a weapon.  If only you could
               see them, father.

     Paul smiles as he looks at the battle in the
     distance.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (his V.O. from the past)
               When the spice flow stops, the entire
               Universe will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron
               and the Emperor himself will be forced to
               deal with us.

214. INT. PASSAGEWAYS - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Rabban stares dumbfounded as many Harkonnen wounded
     and dead are brought through the passageway beyond.
     Rabban grabs a Harkonnen and asks:

                         RABBAN
               What happened?  What happened to you?
               What is he saying?

                    WOUNDED HARKONNEN
               Muad'dib!...  Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!...
               Muad'dib!

215. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES; dunes.  A big thumper is forced into the
     sands.  A RHYTHM is heard pounding on Fremen hand
     drums and rhythm instruments.  Feet scramble.  Black
     stillsuited Fedaykin warrior bodyguards gather.
     Stilgar turns.

                    (to Paul)
               Usul... It is time you become a
               sandrider... and travel as a Fremen.  Take
               the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and
               ride as a leader of men.

217. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     As Paul leaves the troop to plant the second
     thumper:

                     STILGAR (V.O.)
               Two thumpers are planted.  The worm may
               not surface for the first - he will rise
               for the second.  Remember, when the worm
               approaches, you must be utterly still...
               and close enough to plant the hook firmly
               under a ring segment....  The worm will
               turn to lift this exposed area as far from
               the abrasive sand as possible and it will
               take you with it -- to the top.  Do not
               get too close as he approaches... the sand
               will engulf you....  Wait till the head of
               the worm passes -- then go... quickly.

                    STILGAR & FREMEN
               Shai-Hulud... Shai-Hulud.

     In the distance the telltale SOUND of the worm's
     approach begins.  This worm is deep underground and
     the sound is low and the ground trembles violently.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Only the very strong ones travel this
               deep....

     The SOUND and VIBRATIONS continue to build.  In the
     distance, the Fedaykin and Stilgar watch.

                         STILGAR
                    (to the others)
               Usul has called a big one.  Again... it is
               the legend.

219. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES... dunes RHYTHM.  THUNDEROUS approach of
     the worm.  Paul still cannot see the worm, but the
     sound begins to drown out the Fremen rhythm
     instruments and the sand begins to VIBRATE.
     Suddenly, Paul SEES...

219A.     EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - DAY

     ...a mountain of sands rise up, towering, thundering
     -- lightning SPARKS fissuring throughout the air
     above the worm.

     The mountain approaches at a terrifying speed.
     Then, the worm appears -- rushing.  The mouth, at
     first a small opening, begins to widen -- exposing a
     thousand glistening teeth.

219B.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Paul freezes.  He lets the worm get closer and
     closer.  The HEAT WAVES distort the gigantic form,
     making it more hideous -- more foreign.  He moves
     forward.  The others watch anxiously.  This worm is
     big.  It is so much larger than imaged.  Its top
     towers 125 feet in the air.  The segments are each
     ten feet wide.

219C.     EXT. VERTICAL SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Paul gets close and running alongside, he plants the
     hook under a segment and pulls back.  The SOUND is
     excruciatingly loud.  The sand is so deep and more
     is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm.
     Paul gets caught in it and falls. He narrowly
     escapes being sucked under the beast.  He gets up --
     runs again and plants the hook once more.  He runs
     faster, bending the segment open to expose the
     tender flesh.

219D.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Suddenly the worm begins to turn.  Paul pulls
     himself up the body as it turns -- holding onto the
     hook.  Soon he is fifty -- sixty -- seventy feet off
     the ground -- going higher.  The giant worm gets the
     second thumper and Paul at that moment climbs to the
     top.  He plants the second hook.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A sandrider!...

     Paul works the hooks into the breathing holes along
     the body...
--
219E.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     ...causing the great beast to make a slow turn
     toward Stilgar and the bodyguard.  They set
     themselves and as the worm passes...

219F.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     ...they all clamber on, climbing up the sides to the
     top.

                          PAUL
                    (yelling)
               Long live the fighters!

     They return the traditional CALL and Paul steers the
     maker in a giant circle.  They head out across the
     dunes.

     Fighting is going on between Fremen and some

                          PAUL
               We surprised a band of smugglers.

                    (racing into thick smoke)
               Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.

     Paul and Stilgar move through the smoke.  A man runs
     up with a maula pistol aimed at Paul but Paul spins
     and punctures the man's chest with a sound from his
     weirding module.  Paul turns and a large figure
     comes through the smoke.  They surprise each other.
     The figure holds a gun.

                          PAUL

     The Emperor sits on his throne.  Behind him are his
     Sardaukar officers.  In front of him are several
     Guildsmen.  One holds a large electrical apparatus
     up to the face plate of another which translates his
     strange voice into English.

     snap open and he sees Chani looking down at him (the
     last image of the future in the desert).

     In the hollow of a huge dune, Paul stops with Chani.
     They share a look into each other's eyes.  Paul
     turns towards the Fedaykin and nods.  They move in
     quickly to tie and wrap Paul in Fremen rope.  They
     move back and wait quietly.  Chani moves in very
     close to Paul.  She holds a glass vial of the blue
     water of life.

                          PAUL
               Hurry!  All I see is darkness.

                          CHANI

               or in death... let Shai-Hulud judge now.
                    (whispering)
               You are my life.

     She pours the blue liquid into Paul's mouth.  Slow
     move into Paul's face as:

     whole of the desert.

     Paul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani
     stares at him in awe.

     which is crowded with Fremen warriors who chant
     "Maud'Dib" along with the powerful sounds of the
     WIND ORGAN and FREMEN war DRUMS.

     Paul raises his open hand.  SILENCE.  Only the organ
     continues with a soft low NOTE.  The Fremen wait.

               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     A quiet, haunting MOAN of recognition of a master
     rises from the Fremen.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (loud)
               Your time has come.
                    (inner voice)
               Father... our time has come.
                    (out loud again)
               A storm is coming -- our storm... and when
               it comes it will shake the Universe.
               Emperor... we come for you.

     A thunderous ROAR arises.  War DRUMS pound.  The
     ORGAN blows hurricaine of power through the sietch.

                          PAUL
                    (he raises crysknife)
               Long live the fighters!

                         STILGAR
               Long live the fighters!

     Fremen carrying weapons begin moving out in long
     lines from the Hall as the war DRUMS pound.

     The WIND is howling and is starting to blow the

     Another sietch door opens and hundreds and thousands

     Thousands of Fremen are running, planting thumpers

                          PAUL
               Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the
               atomics.  I want an opening through the
               entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have
               wormsign?

     Stilgar and Gurney laugh.

                         STILGAR
               Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of
               which even God has never seen.

     Paul smiles.

261. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Looking down over the huge desert it looks like a
     living sea of wormsign.  Everywhere ripples appear
     and worms are surfacing.
--
261A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Thousands of Fremen are running, positioning
     themselves to mount and ride.

262. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Dust clouds grow faster and the speed of the WIND
     increases.  Sand particles hit at a rock outcropping
     and up close they sound like giant warrior drummers
     pounding before battle.

263. EXT. HARKONNEN SHIPS - DESERT - NIGHT

     Suddenly above come hundreds of SCREAMING space
     ships zooming down across the desert floor and
     towards the landing field.

266. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The storm is howling now.  Sand blasts against rock

267. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY

                         EMPEROR
               Bring in that floating fat man... the
               Baron.

     The Baron is brought in.  Distant warning SIGNALS
     begin.  The Baron is fighting to contain his fear
     because RABBAN'S HEAD SITS ALL BLOODY ON THE FLOOR
     in front of him.  Finally the Emperor speaks.

                         EMPEROR
               Why have you brought me here?

                          BARON
               Your Highness... There must be some
               mistake... I never requested your
               presence.

                         EMPEROR
               Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it.
               Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad
               judgement in assigning to Rabban --
                    (he gestures toward the head)
               -- the governorship....  You forced me to
               come here and set things straight...
               personally.
--
                         A VOICE
               Bring in the messenger.

     Alia is brought in by the Sardaukar soldiers.  She
     is smiling.

                          ALIA
               I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor
               Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be
               very pleased with you.

                         EMPEROR
               Silence!...  I do not court your brother's
               pleasure.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother looks horrified and
     grabs her throat.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (struggling, speaking)
               Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!!
               Kill her.
                    (points to Alia, who is smiling at
                    her)
               Get out of my mind!!!

                          ALIA
               Not until you tell them both who I really
               am.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (strained speech void of emotion)
               Sister of Paul Muad'dib.

     The Reverend Mother slumps.  The Baron's mouth flies
     open.  The Emperor's face goes pale, his lips
     tremble.

                         EMPEROR
               Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?!

     He turns quickly and looks at the two Guild agents
     present in the room.  They stare at him icily.  Alia
     is smiles happily.

268. INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Paul smiles.

                          PAUL
                    (laughs)(to Gurney and Stilgar)
               Alia keeps pace with the storm.
--
     Gurney and Stilgar don't understand.  Suddenly
     enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the
     Shield Wall.

                          PAUL
               Gurney, now!

     Gurney gives a hand signal and...

                         GURNEY
                    (they put on their hoods)
               Atomics!

269. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     ...TWENTY EXPLOSIONS of hydrogen bomb intensity go
     off in a row, cutting a huge gorge through the width
     of the massive Shield Wall.  As the EXPLOSIONS go
     off, a WIND howls, destroying much of Arrakeen and
     covering the rest with tons of sand.  Sand rips at
     the Palace and the Emperor's ship.

270. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY

     Alia smiles as they HEAR the tremendous roaring,
     atomic screams of the explosions.  The Emperor's
     ship's warning SIGNALS are now close and loud.

                          ALIA
               My brother is coming... with many Fremen
               warriors.

     A Sardaukar rushes in.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               The Shield Wall is gone.

                         EMPEROR
               Impossible!

                          ALIA
               Not impossible.  I told you... He is here
               now.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               Majesty, into the ship!

                         EMPEROR
                    (to his officers)(rising)
               Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this
               little abomination to the storm.

     They all leave the room, including the Sardaukars.

                          BARON
               I have her, Majesty!

     The Baron floats down to her.  Alia turns to him --
     still smiling.  With a flash of her hand she reaches
     out and swipes at the Baron's face.  He CRIES OUT in
     pain.  She pulls his suspensor plugs and pushes him
     back, then slowly shows him the tiny needle she
     holds in her hand.  He spins crazily as he screams
     from the poison.

273. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Worms, each with hundreds of Fremen on them, come
     slithering through the newly-formed canyon in the
     Shield Wall.

273A.     EXT. WORMS - SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Paul rides the lead worm with Gurney and Stilgar by
     his side.  The storm is howling and blowing with
     horrifying intensity.

273B.     INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

     The Emperor and his Sardaukar officers in a darkened
     room where they are horrified to see on the screens
     the hundreds of worms which are coming into the
     Arrakeen valley.  All their faces show fear.

272. BACK TO SCENE
     INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - GREEN THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Suddenly the wall behind Alia and the spinning Baron
     is completely blown away by a BLAST.

     The Baron floats and spins out into the storm.

274. EXT. ARRAKEEN - DAY

     As the worms enter the Arrakeen basin they meet the
     Sardaukar.  The Sardaukar don't have a chance -- the
     worms suck them up by the hundreds.  The Fremen on
     the worm's backs fire weapons, killing the few
     Sardaukar the worms leave behind.

275. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     The space ships which were recently airborne are now
     crashing because of the storm.
--
272A.     NEW SCENE

     The Baron floats and spins high in the dust clouds
     of the storm over the Arrakeen Valley.

274A.     NEW SCENE

     The worm, that Paul, Gurney and Stilgar are riding,
     suddenly rears up.  Its mouth opens.  The Baron
     appears as a tiny spinning shape.  He flies directly
     into the mouth of this collosal worm and is
     devoured.

277. EXT. STEEL TENT - LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     A thousand Fremen battle Sardaukar outside the
     Emperor's tent.  They soon overpower them and rush
     into the giant steel structure.

278. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     The entire airfield is now filled with wild worms,
     Fremen, and dead or dying Sardaukar.

276. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Alia moves dreamily among the dying Sardaukar.

279. through 280.   (Deleted)

281. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul enters the Palace hall and the first thing he
     sees is the giant bull's head.  The horns have been
     blown off and the Atreides banner has been stuffed
     and wired into the mouth.

     A WIND moans through the Palace.

     Paul turns.  Gurney and several guards bring in the
     Emperor, Irulan, the Reverend Mother, Sardaukar
     generals, Guildsmen, Feyd and Thufir.  The Fedaykin
     and Fremen troops line the walls.

     Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil
     smile.

     Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back
     defiantly.  Paul moves his gaze to Irulan, who
     lowers her eyes.  He then sees his old teacher,
     Thufir Hawat, whose tired eyes wander helplessly.
--
                          PAUL
               Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the
               captives.  Let him stand free.

                         GURNEY
               My Lord?

                          PAUL
               Let him stand free!

     The Emperor turns nervously to Feyd, who passes a
     golden dagger to Thufir.

                          FEYD
                    (to Thufir)
               The antidote...

                         GURNEY
                    (gestures to Thufir)
               Thufir.  Come.

     Thufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They
     come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely
     tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks
     Thufir over.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               A knife....
                    (out loud)
               In payment of the many years of service to
               my family, you may know ask of me anything
               you wish.  Anything at all.
                    (quietly)
               Do you need my life, old friend?

     He turns his back on him.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (quiet)
               It is yours.

     Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide.

                          PAUL
               I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to
               strike, do it now.

     Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old
     Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing
     motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags.

     His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul
     urgently.
--
                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Three... generations... of you...

     His breath escapes him and he is dead.

                          PAUL
                    (to the guards)
               Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.
               Do him all honor.

     The guards do as they are instructed.

                          PAUL
               Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild
               Heighliners above us containing many Great
               Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM
               BACK!

                         EMPEROR
               How dare you speak to me...

                      GUILDSMAN #2
                    (speaking into electric microphone)
               Stop your speaking!!

                          PAUL
                    (to the Guildsmen)
               Good.  You have some idea of what I would
               do but I will tell it to one who has never
               been seen... one who hides deep in the
               Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it
               first.

                      GUILDSMEN #3
                    (fear)
               No!

     Paul smiles as we move closer and closer to him.

282. INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     Suddenly we are in the Heighliner control room, near
     the floor in the chemical spills.  We move up into
     the orange gas.  THUNDERING begins to shake the
     Heighliner.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Where are you....  Let me see you or there
               will be no spice.
--
     We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING.
     Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.

                   PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D)
               You know what I'm about to say is true....
               I have the power to destroy the spice
               forever.

     The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a
     horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and
     grows louder and louder.

283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING
     and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen
     stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and
     frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend
     Mother then turns and glares at Paul.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking
               into that place where you dare not look.
               You'll find me there staring back at you!!
               You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety
               generations to produce the one person your
               schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I
               will never be yours.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Stop him, Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               Stop him yourself.

                          PAUL
               You saw a part of what the race needs in
               the beginning.  In time you perverted the
               truth.  You sought to control human
               breeding and intermix a select few
               according to a selfish master plan.  How
               little you understand.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You mustn't speak of...

                          PAUL
                    (using The Voice)
               SILENCE!

     The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his
     shout.  Her breath is knocked out of her.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I remember your gom jabbar, now you
               remember mine.  I can kill with a word.
--
     A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the
     prophecy.

                       FEDAYKIN #1
               ...and his word shall carry death eternal
               to those who stand against the righteous.

     Feyd hears this and is angered.

                          FEYD
               The righteous!

                          PAUL
                    (to Emperor)
               There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the
               Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.

                         EMPEROR
               If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my
               blade in his hand.

                          FEYD
               I wish it.
                    (steps forward)

                         GURNEY
               This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me,
               please, my Lord.

                          PAUL
               The Emperor's blade.

     Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile.
     Paul takes out his crysknife.  They begin to circle
     each other.

     Paul smiles, circling still.  Suddenly, Feyd leaps,
     his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily
     evades it, moving away.  They begin to circle again.

     He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously
     close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on
     his face.

                          FEYD
               Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill
               you!  I will kill him!

     Feyd smiles.  He lashes out biting Paul's hand.
     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.

     Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also
     forward.  Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again
     reels away.  Again, Feyd thrusts.
--
     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd
     moves away effortlessly.  Feyd counters and kicks
     Paul to the ground.

                          CHANI
               Paul!

     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.

                          FEYD
                    (smiling)
               Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps?
               Will she deserve my special attentions?

     Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs
     his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a
     straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer
     and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it
     away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's
     girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges
     powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses
     taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not
     before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the
     floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.

                          FEYD
                    (whispering)
               You see... your death... my blade will
               finish you.

     Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes
     Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash.

     Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward
     through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife
     continues up through his tongue and through to his
     brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he
     jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his
     feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in
     him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible,
     powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture
     and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The
     Fedaykin smile.

                       FEDAYKIN #2
               Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

     Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the
     Emperor.

                          PAUL
               Now, I will tell you how it will be.
               Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way
               for an Atreides to take the throne.

                         EMPEROR
               I sit on the throne!!
--
                          PAUL
               You will sit on a throne on Selusa
               Secundus, your prison planet.  Either that
               or you will die.

     The Emperor is still.  Paul moves to Chani.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (to Chani)
               The Princess shall have no more of me than
               my name... no child of mine or touch the
               softness of glance... nor instant of
               desire....  This is my promise to you...
                    (whispering)
               ...my love.

     Paul turns back to the others.

     Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.

                         JESSICA
               Think on it Chani... We who carry the name
               of concubine... history will call us
               wives.

     Alia enters with two monks.  She signals and one of
     them places a cloak over Paul's shoulders.

                          PAUL
               The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib.
               They will have their Holy War to cleanse
               the Universe... they will have Arrakis...
               Dune... their planet.  There will be
               flowing water here open to the sky and
               rich green oases.  For the spice there
               will always be some desert.  There will be
               fierce winds and trials to toughen men.
               We Fremen have a saying...
                    (he stares at the Reverend Mother)
               "God created Arrakis to train the
               faithful."
               One cannot go against the word of God.

     Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.

                          ALIA
               And how can this be?

     There are three powerful drum hits.

                      ALIA (CONT'D)
               For... he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
--
284. EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - DUSK

     Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing
     wind.  Lightning and thunder begin.  Clouds begin to
     form over the Palace.  In the half-light of dusk,
     thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden
     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into
     the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five
     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a
     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand
     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling
     from the sky.

285. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     WE MOVE through Paul's glowing blue eyes into
     beautiful blue luminescent light.

     A gigantic WIND arises, and suddenly appearing in
     the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like
     gold glass off into infinite.  The blue becomes
     darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the
     night.

                         THE END

Commentary by Richard Michaels



TITLES: "E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTIAL"

[The letters are in soft-purple against a black background. Purple is
traditionally the color of that which is sacred.]

EXT: NIGHT SKY: NIGHT

The black screen becomes a night sky. The camera angles lowers to show a
forest against the night sky.

EXT: LANDING SITE: NIGHT

In an opening in the forest stands a spacecraft. The view of the craft is
obscured by tree branches. The atmosphere is misty, with blue lights coming
from the spacecraft.

[The opening scene is misty and diffused. This forces the audience to pay
close attention to the images on the screen. The characters are not clearly
seen. This engages the audience, as they attempt to see what the aliens
really look like.]

One creature walks up the gang blank and into the ship.

INSERT: ALIEN HAND

A strange hand, with two long and slender fingers protruding, move aside a
branch that obstructs the view.

[This concentrates the audience's attention. The creature going into the
ship is being observed by another creature. Who are they? What's going on?
This is another technique that forces the audience to focus on the action.]

INT: SPACECRAFT'S GREENHOUSE: NIGHT

The inside of the ship appears to be a greenhouse. There are sounds of
water dripping. Cone shaped objects (possibly alien plants) sit among earth
plants. Vapors flow up from the plants.

[These images all appear non-threatening. The aliens are inferred to be
collecting vegetation, and are thereby inferred to be harmless.]

[Like many of Spielberg's other films, the opening sequences contain almost
no dialogue. The story is told without verbal exposition. He forces the
audience to become engaged in the storytelling process by giving them just
bits of information that they have to piece together into the story. He
doesn't insult their intelligence.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

A group of the aliens work in front of the spacecraft. Suddenly, they hear
a dog howl, and they all stop working. Red lights begin to glow in their
chests. It appears as if their hearts have lit up at the sign of danger, as
the red glow seeps through their translucent skin. After a moment the red
lights dim and they return to their work.

[This sets up the prop of the red-lights signifying danger. These small
creatures are endearing and non-threatening. They are like children, which
is immediate grounds for audience empathy. The thought that they may be in
danger from wild creatures in the forest, also creates empathy for them.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

A small fern grows on the forest floor. An alien hand, with two fingers
protruding, reaches out for the fern. The alien groans. A rabbit turns and
listens. The fingers dig up the plant as the rabbit watches. The alien then
carefully uproots the plant. A small wayward alien walks alone among the
gigantic redwood trees. He's dwarfed by the huge trees.

[The awesome towering trees psychologically creates audience empathy for
the creature. The audience identifies with him because they too feel small
when confronted by these trees.]

EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT

The creature stands alone on a hilltop as he stares down at the city lights
below. Suddenly he lets out a moan of fright. A truck, with headlights
glaring, pulls up next to him.

[The quiet, peaceful alien is now in jeopardy.]

The creature runs from the lights. Several other trucks with head- lights
glaring drive up. Smoke flows from their exhaust pipes. Men's legs are seen
as they walk among the trucks. They step into a mud puddle as E.T. watches
from behind a shrub. A man with keys jangling from his waist walks past a
headlight. He carries a flashlight in his hands.

[Keys have now become a prop which identifies the antagonist of the story:
the faceless government agent. Like the antagonist of many other fantasy
films, his face is not initially revealed in order to hold the audiences
attention.]

The man with keys walks to a truck where he and two other men review a map
that's placed on the hood of the truck. The man with keys holds the
flashlight up and points it at the hood. E.T watches them from the bushes.

[The fact that E.T. is observing the actions of the men also creates a
psychological bond between the audience and him, since they are also
observing these characters.]

[While the audience doesn't actually see a map, they presume its existence
given the actions of the characters. This style of story telling engages
the audience, and gets them guessing about the characters' actions. They
then create expectations, which are later often proved to be wrong. This
makes the story both unpredictable and exciting.]

EXT: SPACESHIP: NIGHT

An alien stands in front of a round light and transmits a homing signal,
presumably to call the other aliens back to the ship.

[These characters are all in jeopardy.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

When E.T hears the sound, his red heart lights up. The homing signal
reverberates in his chest.

[This establishes that his heart is used as a communication device, i.e.,
these aliens communicate with their hearts.]

"Keys" hears this sound and quickly turns around. He points his flashlight
towards the sounds. The other men join him as they walk towards the sound.
E.T. screams and runs away, which is indicated by the shaking bushes. The
men with flashlights chase after him.

[So, like Dorothy in the WIZARD OF OZ, the opening scene has the
protagonist being pursued by an unknown antagonist.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

The lights dim on the footings of the spacecraft, presumably because the
spacecraft is preparing to takeoff.

[The protagonist has the added jeopardy of being abandoned.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

E.T. screams as he races for the spacecraft. The glow from his red-heart
reflects off the bushes as he runs towards the white light of the
spacecraft.

[The audience still hasn't seen the face of the protagonist.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

A lone alien stands before a large round white light, as he signals for the
other aliens to return to the ship.

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

Men with flashlights run through the forest, as they pursue the red glowing
light racing towards the spacecraft. One of the pursuers is the man wearing
the keys on his waist.

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

The grated gangplank lifts up, blocking the entrance to the ship. Behind
the grate stands the alien against the large round white light. The red
light of the aliens heart lights up as he stands behind the barrier.

[This image exhibits an obstacle to E.T. returning to his ship.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

The men reach the edge of the clearing and stop as they watch the
spacecraft lift off.

One red lighted heart races along an old country fence towards the
departing spacecraft. Men with flashlights are still in pursuit. They stop
at a wooden gate as they watch the spacecraft fly away.

E.T., with face obstructed by a branch, and with red-heart aglow, watches
the spacecraft fly away into the night. He utters a sorrowful moan.

[He has been abandoned in a hostile alien world. This situation is
guaranteed to generate audience empathy.]

The men with flashlights pointed up towards the sky watch the space- craft
fly away. They hear E.T.'s groan, and in unison point their flashlights in
his direction.

[Not only is the small childlike creature abandoned, but he is still in
jeopardy of being captured by those who pursue him.]

[This is the inciting event in E.T.'s story: his spacecraft has deserted
him.]

EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT

Below lies the city, lit up against the dark night sky. E.T slowly makes
his way down the slope.

Men with flashlights follow. They reach the hilltop, search the underbrush
for the alien, then start down the slope after him.

[This concludes the prelude to the story. Both the protagonist and
antagonist have been introduced, and audience empathy has been established
for the protagonist. The protagonist's primary objective is to survive and
find a way home, while the antagonist's primary objective is to capture the
alien.]

EXT: SUBURBAN HOUSE: NIGHT

[This is an establishing shot.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

A group of boys are sitting around a table playing a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS
game. One boy is on the telephone ordering a pizza. They throw wads of
paper at each other as they play.

Elliott, the youngest boy, sits behind the counter. He's separated from the
other boys. After a few moments he yells that he's ready to play the game.

[The character's positions are structured to emphasize Elliott's separation
from the others.]

One of the boys tells Elliott that he can't join when they are in the
middle of the game.

[Audience empathy is generated for the young child who is being excluded
from the game.]

Elliott walks up to the table and yells at his brother, Mike. Michael says
that Elliott has to ask Steve, who is the Game Master, and who has absolute
power.

[The notion of "absolute power" is set up here, for a "payoff" later when
Elliott uses it to keep Michael silent about E.T.]

[Elliott's objective here is to play the game, but also to be accepted by
the group and gain the respect of the older boys.]

Steve tells Elliott that first he has to wait for the pizza, then when he
brings it back he can play. Steve gives him money for the pizza. Elliott
picks up his baseball and glove, then leaves the room.

[The ball and glove are props that will be used in the story.]

[Elliott's sub-objective is to get the pizza. Once this is accomplished,
he'll be able to play the game.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

It's a rainy, misty night. Elliott, with ball and glove in hand wait at the
bottom of the driveway for the pizza. A car pulls up and parks in the
driveway. Elliott pays the driver, then takes the pizza box from him as the
car pulls out of the driveway.

Elliott walks up the driveway and into the garage. He hears a noise in the
backyard, then calls out the name "HARVEY," presumably his dogs name.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott's mother wears an orange outfit as she works in the kitchen. She
bends over to put dishes into the dishwasher. When she does this one of the
young boys reaches out to put his finger on her rear. Mike yells for him to
stop. He pulls his finger away.

INT: PATIO: NIGHT

Elliot walks past the ping pong table when he hears more noises in the
backyard. Again he calls out the name "Harvey."

[This generates tension and suspense in the audience.]

With the pizza box in hand, Elliot walks past the patio table and towards
the shed in the backyard. A bright crescent moon hangs in the night sky.

[This adds enchantment to the scene.]

There is a mist in the air, and a bright light shines in the shed. Elliott
places the pizza box on the ground as he approaches the shed. He's still
carrying the baseball and glove as he stands in front of the shed's
entrance. He tosses the ball into the shed. After a few seconds the ball is
tossed back out at him and hits him on the foot.

[This is the payoff to the setup of the baseball prop. This event surprises
both Elliott and the audience.]

Elliott becomes frightened, turns and steps on the pizza box as he runs
towards the house.

[This is the inciting event in Elliott's story: there is some creature
hiding out in his shed that will change his whole life.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott's mother is talking to the boys when Elliott runs into the house
screaming that there's something in the tool shed. He tells them that it
threw a ball at him, but they continue to ignore him until he screams
"QUIET!" "Nobody go out there," says Elliott. The boys immediately jump up
from the table. Two boys grab kitchen knives as Michael tells his mother to
stay inside. He and his friends will check it out. She yells at them to put
the knives back as she follows them outside.

EXT: SHED: NIGHT

The light is still on in the shed.

EXT: PATIO: NIGHT

Elliott's mother walks into the yard with a flashlight in her hand. She is
surrounded by the boys as they approach the shed. The mother says that
there's nothing in there as Michael walks through the entrance. Michael
bends down and finds tracks on the dirt floor. "The coyote's come back
again, Ma." he says. His mother becomes frightened and orders them all back
into the house.

[Jeopardy is introduced into the situation. Even though the audience knows
that it is probably the alien in the shed, the scene increases the
tension.]

On his way back to the house, Michael sees the pizza box. He bends down,
opens the box, then takes out a piece. He's angry at Elliott. Elliott tries
to explain that it was just an accident, but his brother is still angry.
When the mother asks who ordered the pizza, Elliott points to one of Mike's
friends. This makes the friend mad at Elliott. Elliot tries to persuade his
mother that there is a creature in the shed, but she doesn't believe him.
They walk into the house.

[Empathy is generated for Elliott because the two boys are unfairly angry
at him and his mother doesn't believe him.]

INT: SHED: NIGHT

The alien's fingers point out into the shed entrance, then wrap around the
side of the door. The sound of his heavy breathing is heard.

[This establishes for the audience that he really is in the shed. They feel
sorry for Elliott because he was telling the truth and no one believed
him.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: NIGHT

The clock on the end table indicates 2:00. Next to the clock is a picture
of a dog, presumably Harvey. This same dog lies asleep in the bed. He hears
a noise and picks up his head. He is in the lower half of a bunk bed. On
the top bunk sits Elliott. He is awake as he listens to the noise outside.

[Elliott's objective is to prove there's a creature in the shed.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott opens a gate and walks into the backyard. He carries a flashlight
in his hand and shines it into the cornfield next to his house. He walks
into the field.

EXT: CORNFIELD: NIGHT

Elliott walks into the cornfield. He whistles, and gets entangled in the
cornstalks as he walks. He sees tracks in the dirt with his baseball
nearby. He continues to walk through the field.

[The stalks are obstacles that obstruct both his path and his vision. It
also clutters the visuals and forces the audience to pay closer attention.
The suspense increases because they aren't sure whether he'll meet up with
the alien or the coyote.]

Elliott pushes aside some stalks and shines the light into the face of E.T.
Together, in unison, the scream. Elliot drops his light, then continues to
scream as he looks around the field. E.T. cries out and runs away through
the cornfield.

[Their reactions upon seeing each other were identical. This is the first
instance of a series of situations which will "merge" their characters to
such an extent that whatever empathy the audience has for one they will
also have for the other.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott runs into his backyard. His play swings sway back and forth in the
air, as if someone had just bumped into them. Two garbage pails fall over
near an open metal gate at the top of a stone stairway. The garbage rolls
out of the cans and down the stone stairs. A red light by the gate lights
the stone stairway.

[The audience psychologically associates this red light with E.T.'s red
lighted heart, and makes the inference that he had run up the staircase and
out the gate.]

Elliott has an expression of wonderment and gratification on his face as he
looks up the staircase, for he has just established the existence of the
creature in the shed.]

EXT: GARAGE: DAY

Elliott rides down the driveway on his bicycle. He next rides down a dirt
road that overlooks the suburban community.

[Elliott's new objective is to locate the creature.]

EXT: FOREST ROAD: DAY

Elliott holds a bag of candy in one hand as he pours some into the other
hand. He tosses candy onto the round as he walks through the woods calling
out for the creature.

In another part of the woods Elliott lays his bike down, then continues to
toss candy and yell out "hello!" He sees a man on the road below and
quickly hides behind a tree.

["Keys," the faceless antagonist, is still pursuing the alien.]

Elliott runs back to his bike, then rides down the forest road past a wire
fence. The alien's fingers side down the side to the tree. He was watching
Elliott.

[Elliott is in jeopardy both from the faceless man and the faceless alien.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Elliott's mother sits at the tale with the dog, Harvey, at her side.
Elliott, Michael and Gertie are eating supper.

[This is a home without a father, which creates more empathy for the
protagonist.]

Gertie asks Elliott what he's going as for Halloween. He's depressed, and
replies that he's not going. Mike mocks him by suggesting that he go as a
goblin. Elliott snaps back, telling Mike to shut up. The mother tries to
explain that it's not that they don't believe him, but Elliott cries out
that the creature was real.

[The audience also knows that the creature is real. This generates more
empathy for the protagonist, because he is mocked and not believed when he
is expressing the truth.]

Mike offers other suggestions: perhaps it was an iguana, a deformed child,
or maybe an Elf or a Leprechaun. Elliott gets angry and shouts "It was
nothing like that, penis breath." Mary, his mother shouts at him to sit
down. Elliott responds with "Dad would believe me." Mary replies "Maybe you
ought to call your father and tell him about it." "I can't. He's in Mexico
with Sally" says Elliott. Both Mary and Mike are upset, while Gertie asks
"Where's Mexico?" Mary excuses herself and leaves the table. She walks to
the window as Mike tells Elliott that he's going to kill him. "If you ever
see it again, don't touch it. Just call me and we'll have someone come and
take it away," says Mary. "Like the dog catcher?" says Gertie. "But they'll
give it a lobotomy, or do experiments on it or something," says Elliott.

[This sets up the audience's expectations about the harm that will befall
the alien when he is captured.]

After a bit of dialogue concerning who should be doing the dishes, Mary
leaves the room saying "He hates Mexico."

[This scene explores the emotional relationships between the family members
in greater detail. Empathy is also generated for Mary who was abandoned by
her husband. She is left with the responsibility of raising the children
while he's traveling with his new girlfriend to Mexico, a country which he
hates.]

Elliott takes some dishes to the sink, turns on the faucet and gazes out
the kitchen window as water steams up from the sink.

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

A crescent moon floats in the sky. A bright light is on in the shed. In
front of the shed Elliott lies inside a sleeping bag on a folding chair
with a flashlight in his hand. He hears the sound of feet walking in the
underbrush.

Elliott sits up to see the alien standing in front of the shed. The alien
groans as Elliott freezes from fear in his chair. He tries to call out for
his mother, but can't get the words out of his mouth. He next tries to call
Mike, but fear makes him choke on his words.

The alien approaches Elliott. The bright light from the shed makes it
impossible to see his face: only the outline of his form is visible. The
alien walks right up to the edge of the lawn chair.

[The scene is filled with suspense because Elliott may be in jeopardy from
the creature.]

The alien slowly moves its hand over the chair, then drops candies onto the
blanket. Elliott relaxes.

[This non-verbal gesture by E.T. demonstrates that he is harmless. The
tension in the scene is thereby released. Elliott has achieved his
objective: he established contact with the alien.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott places candy on the carpet, then walks backwards down the hallway
towards his room. E.T. walks up the stairs and reaches out for the candy,
which he then takes into his hand and eats.

[Elliott's new objective is to get the alien into his room. His main
obstacles are to somehow persuade the alien to come into the house, while
not waking his family.]

[This scene also is a good example of how to structure a scene's beginning.
In real life, the scene would have started in the backyard, tracked through
the kitchen, the living room and then up the stairs. But since all of that
information would have been redundant, picking the action up from the top
of the stairs was sufficient.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

Elliott places candy on the floor by the entrance to his room. A sign on
his door contains the word "ENTER." E.T picks up the candy.

Elliott has run out of candy. He goes to his desk in search for more. He
opens some drawers, but doesn't find any. When he returns to the doorway,
E.T. has already entered the room. E.T. pulls a box down from the table,
then knocks a can filled with pens onto the floor. This makes a loud noise,
and forces Elliott to quickly close the door to his room.

[The audience still does not have a clear view of E.T.'s face nor body.
This holds their attention during the scene. They are waiting for that
wonderful moment.]

Elliott throws a blanket over E.T. as they stare at each other. E.T. is
finally revealed to the audience.

Elliott moves his hand in front of his face, a gesture indicating
bewilderment. E.T. mimics this action.

[This is the beginning of their efforts to communicate, but also the start
of the audience emotionally identifying the two characters as one object of
empathy.]

Elliott places his fingers to his lips to see if E.T. will respond in the
same manner, which he does. Elliott then places one finger to his ear,
which E.T. also mimics. Elliott smiles, then holds his left hand up with
all five fingers spread apart. E.T. raises his left hand with three fingers
spread apart. Elliott closes his fingers until there is only one remaining
up. E.T. does the same. They both wiggle this one finger. A poster on the
wall between Elliott and E.T. has the word "SUPERSTAR" printed on it.

[These actions help the audience to conceive of these two characters as
"mirror images" of one another, worthy of equal empathy. It also bonds the
young children in the audience to them, because the characters are speaking
in a language they too can understand. All the children in the audience
have just been through the experience of learning a language. They can
easily identify with the problems that that two characters in the story are
having in communicating with each other. This forges a bond between the
children and both Elliott and E.T. This also forms the basis for the repeat
viewing of this film which was essential for its phenomenal box-office
success.]

Suddenly, Elliott becomes tired and yawns, then sways as if in a trance. He
slowly walks backwards and sits down in a chair. Elliott seems asleep as
the camera moves up for a closeup of Elliott's face.

[Presumably, E.T. has used his telepathic powers to place Elliott into a
trance in order to merge their minds and feelings.]

[This is the end of the first act. Elliott has succeeded in gaining
possession of the dramatic objective E.T.), and has him in his room. But
E.T. has also taken possession of Elliott by merging their feelings, so
that they both become one protagonist. The second act will end when they
are both captured by the antagonist.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Mist envelops the fence and gate in the section of the forest where E.T
originally landed. Men with flashlights and floodlights search throughout
the area. "Keys" walks into the forefront, holding a flashlight in his
hand. He bends to the ground and finds some candy.

[The objective of the faceless antagonist is to capture the alien. The
candy is a prop that will lead them to Elliott's house just as Elliott used
them to lead E.T. into his room. This scene shows that the protagonist is
in jeopardy, because he is still being pursued.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott lies in bed with a thermometer in his mouth. His head rests on an
orange pillow (same color as his mother's dress in the first scene) while
his mother sits besides him. She takes out the thermometer, reads it, then
says "Okay, you're hot." She then leaves the room. Elliott quickly swings a
lamp back over his head and heats the thermometer. He also places a blue
heating pad over his face, to heat himself. He then places the thermometer
back into his mouth, swings the lamp away, and places the heating pad under
the covers as his mother enters the room. She opens his closet and
separates the hanging clothes as she walks into the closet. Elliott sits up
in bed and intensely watches her.

[Elliott's objective is to stay home from school in order to be with E.T.
His obstacle is his mother, who wants him to go to school. To overcome this
obstacle he must persuade her that he's sick. A crisis occurs when she
enters the closet in which E.T. is hiding. This creates jeopardy for the
protagonist.]

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Mike backs the car down the driveway.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

Mary walks out of the closet carrying a blue sleeping bag. Elliott is
tense, then relieved, once he realizes that she didn't find E.T. He falls
back into bed.

INTERCUT: DRIVEWAY

Mike backs the car over part of the lawn.

[This scene functions not only as comic relief, but also as a set up for
the scene here Mike has to drive the van during E.T.'s escape sequence.
This demonstrates both his incompetence, and that he is only allowed to
drive the car backwards down the driveway.]

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

Mary covers Elliott with the blue sleeping bag as Elliott puts the
thermometer back into his mouth (first backwards, then he corrects it).

[Humor is generated because the audience knows that he is fooling his
mother.]

INTERCUT: DRIVEWAY

Mike continues to back the car down the driveway. He overshoots the edge
and goes out into the street. He then pulls forward across the sidewalk.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

"You were outside waiting for that thing?" says Mary. Elliott nods.

[Elliott is covered in blue-white colors, which traditionally signify
innocence, and which generates audience empathy for him.]

She tells him not to watch TV, kisses him, then leaves the room. Elliott
quickly closes the blinds.

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Mary runs down the driveway towards the car. Gertie points out the patches
of lawn that Mike pulled onto the driveway as he was driving the car. Mary
pulls her into the car.

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott gestures for E.T. to walk out of the closet, which he does. He is
wearing Elliott's robe. Elliott asks him if he talks.

[Elliott's objective is to communicate with E.T., his obstacle is that E.T.
does not speak the English language.]

"Me Human. Boy. Elliott, Elliott, Elliott" says Elliott.

E.T. turns away and walks towards the work table. Elliott picks up objects,
such as a can of coke and toy soldiers, from the table then names them for
E.T. Elliott points to the fish and explains how the fish eat the fish
food. He places a wooden toy shark into the fishbowl, then states that the
shark eats the fish but nobody eats the shark.

[In his effort to communicate with E.T., Elliott tries to teach him the
language by showing him objects that are used in everyday life. This
process is similar to that experienced by the children and parents in the
audience everyday as they also learn and attempt to communicate with each
other. This type of scene solidifies the audience's emotional bonding with
Elliott and E.T.]

E.T. takes a toy car into his mouth on chews on it.

[Like many a child would.]

Elliott takes this to mean that E.T. is hungry. Elliott tells E.T. to stay
where he is.

[Elliott's new objective is to get food for E.T. and himself.]

Elliott opens the door and Harvey tries to run into the room. E.T. groans
with fear and backs into a corner as Elliott pulls Harvey out of the room.

[This introduces jeopardy into the scene, for Harvey could harm E.T.]

INT: KITCHEN: DAY

Elliott, dressed only in white underwear, opens the refrigerator door and
takes out some food.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. walks around the room.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott opens up a jar of peanut butter.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. touches a tennis racket.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott picks up cheese and tomatoes.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. picks up an umbrella.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott takes a carton of milk out of the refrigerator.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. accidentally opens up the umbrella.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott screams with fright and drops the milk carton onto the floor.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. screams with fright, drops the umbrella, then runs into the closet.

[This further establishes the merging of E.T. and Elliott into one being.
Elliott shares E.T.'s feelings and simultaneously experiences what he
experiences. The audience also experiences this surprise with them, which
further tightens the bonds.]

Milk flows from the open carton onto the floor, as Elliott leans into the
open refrigerator. He clutches his chest and looks up towards the ceiling
as he ponders his experience.

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott carries a plate of food into the room. He walks past the open
umbrella and looks into the closet. Stuffed animals line the back of the
closet wall. E.T. pushes the animals forward. He was hiding behind them. He
is still shaking from the fright experience. "Are you okay? Too much
excitement, huh? You want a coke?"

[This is the resolution of the last scene sequence. We see both characters'
reactions to the events that have occurred.]

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Michael runs up the driveway towards his house. He's wearing a red football
blazer.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Michael opens the front door and runs into the house. He takes off his red
shirt to reveal the blue shirt he's wearing underneath. He picks up a
magazine then opens the refrigerator. "Nothing but health shit," he says,
as he takes out a can and shakes it.

[The audience tenses up because jeopardy has just been introduced into the
story. They wonder what will happen when Mike discovers E.T. in Elliott's
bedroom.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott walks away from his closet and opens the door to his room. He tells
Mike to come in. Both boys are dressed in blue and white colors. Mike calls
Elliott a faker, then starts to tell him about scores on an asteroid game,
when Elliott interrupts, to tell him about the goblin. Michael makes fun of
Elliott and his belief that the goblin has returned. But Elliott persists,
and makes Mike promise to give Elliott "absolute power."

[This is the payoff to the "absolute power" concept as set up during the
DUNGEON AND DRAGONS scene.]

[Elliott's objective is to vindicate himself to his brother and sister by
proving that "the Goblin-E.T." really does exist.]

Ellott makes Mike close his eyes, then he retrieves E.T. from the closet
and leads him to the center of the room. Mike has a silly grin on his face
as he opens his eyes and turns around to look at E.T. A sickening look of
terror comes over his face.

Suddenly Gertie opens the door and walks into the room with her doll under
her arm, saying "Elliott, look what I made for you." E.T. sees her then
stretches his neck to raise his head high. Gertie walks right up to him and
screams. E.T. screams back at her. Elliott screams for both of them to
stop. Mike falls back against the wall and knocks down the bookcase. They
all scream together. Elliott grabs Gertie's mouth and pushes her back to
Mike.

"Kids, I'm home," shouts Mary from downstairs.

[Jeopardy! The mother, an adult, is about to discover E.T. Even though they
are terrified, the children all band together against the threat. They'd
rather sit in the closet with the "monster" than have their mother discover
him.]

Mike quickly shuts the door, then they all run to the closet. Gertie
screams again. Mike grabs her by the mouth and pulls her away as E.T. runs
across the room with his arms raised. Elliott shuts the closet door just as
his mother walks into his room. Mary notices the fallen bookcase. She looks
around and then comments, "This is no room, this is an accident." Elliot
tries to cover by saying he was "reorganizing."

INT: CLOSET: DAY

E.T.'s head appears among the stuffed animals. Mike has his hand over
Gertie's mouth as she tries to scream. Mary walks past the closet door.

[This creates suspense in the audience: will E.T. be discovered by Mary?]

Mary asks Elliot to keep an eye on Gertie while she takes a shower. She
kisses him on the head then leaves the room. Elliott opens the closet door.
Michael, in awe with mouth open wide, watches as Elliott approaches E.T.

"Elliott," whispers Mike. "I'm keeping him," says Elliott.

E.T. sits behind the stuffed animals as if he was one of them.

[The use of stuffed animals as props around E.T helps to transfer positive
feelings that the audience has for them to E.T.]

Gertie asks what it is as she and Michael approach E.T. Elliott tells her
that it won't hurt her. When asked if it's a boy or girl, Elliott replies
that it's a boy. He then tells her that she can't tell Mom about the
creature. When asked why not, he explains that "grownups can't see him.
Only little kids can see him." Gertie snaps back, "Give me a break."

[The charm in Gertie's character lies in the contradictory attributes of
being a sophisticated child. Humor is generated by this incongruity.]

Elliott then goes into his Dracula voice: "Then do you know what will
happen if you do tell?" He grabs Gertie's doll, tosses it to Mike and tells
him to "Do it!." Mike "tortures" the doll by twisting its arm. Gertie cries
as she runs to it. E.T. watches the scene with wonderment in his eyes.
Gertie finally promises not to tell about E.T. They all watch him as he
stretches his neck and lifts up his head.

EXT: COMMUNITY: DAY

On the hilltop overlooking the neighborhood stands a man with a camera as
he takes photos of the houses below. The man with keys on his waist walks
into the area, as other men comb the ground with electronic equipment.

[Jeopardy is introduced in the scene in order to maintain tension in the
audience. The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]

EXT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT

[This is an establishing shot.]

INT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT

Mary, carrying a yellow watering pail, walks across the room and waters a
large plant. Gertie pulls a little red wagon into the hallway. When asked
by Mary what she's doing, Gertie replies that she's going to play in
Elliott's room. "Okay, don't let them torture you," says the mother. "I
won't, Mary," replies Gertie.

[This generates humor because the child deals with the mother as if they
are equals.]

Gertie picks up a pot containing a sickly geranium plant and places it into
the wagon. The phone rings and Mary answers it off screen.

[The plant becomes an important prop because in the story it will represent
the health and well-being of E.T.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

Gertie knocks on the door. Mike lets her and Harvey into the room. They
walk to the table where E.T. and Elliott are sitting. Gertie puts the
sickly plant n the table. E.T. puts his finger into the plant. Elliott
opens up an encyclopedia and points to California on a map of the United
States. "We are here," Elliott says as E.T. munches on celery. Michael
hands Elliott a globe and tells him to use this instead of the map. Elliott
points to the globe, then asks E.T. where he's from. E.T. points out the
window.

[Elliott's objective is to discover more about the alien.]

Elliott opens the book to a page that has the map of a galaxy. He points to
the planet earth, touches the globe, then says "HOME, HOME." E.T. makes a
soft noise that sounds similar to the word "home." Gertie watches him as he
picks up round objects and places them on the map: three small pieces of
fruit and two eggs. E.T.'s eyes concentrate on the table, which then starts
to shake. The two eggs and three small pieces of fruit then lift off the
table and float in the air. The children watch with awe.

[This introduction of "magical" powers that E.T. possesses was unexpected
and thereby helps to make the story unpredictable.]

Elliott screams with fright and the floating objects drop to the floor. He
walks to a lamp and stares into it. Mike asks what is wrong. "I don't know.
Something scary," says Elliott as E.T. places his finger on Elliott's
shoulder.

[Jeopardy is introduced into the scene with this comment. Yet it is not
E.T. who is to be feared, as indicated by his comforting gesture of placing
his finger on Elliott's shoulder.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott runs by the shed, past a swaying swing, up the stairs to the red
lamppost and to the wire gate. He strains to hear the sounds of men
talking.

[The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

E.T. sits next to a lamp as he reads a child's ABC book. He sits next to a
Raggedy Ann doll.]

[Another image of E.T. learning the language which helps to forge a bond
between him and children in the audience. Good feelings for the doll are
also transferred to the alien.]

On the floor next to E.T. is the pot containing the sickly flowers. He
looks at the flowers, makes a moaning sound, and suddenly they become
healthy and transform into full bloom.

[This establishes the magical healing powers of E.T.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Elliott and Mike walk down the driveway. They are on their way to school.
They discuss E.T., arguing about how smart he is.

[This is just a transition scene.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mike and Elliot walk towards a bus stop where a group of children are
waiting. Mike's friends torment Elliott about his "goblin."

[This generates more audience empathy for Elliott, who is unfairly mocked
by the ignorant boys. Elliott still has not earned the respect of Mike's
friends, which is one of his dreams.]

They finally get on the bus as Elliott walks away, followed by a pretty
blonde girl who seems to have a crush on him. Michael appears worried as he
sits on the bus among the other children who are throw- ing objects at each
other.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Gertie stands on the stairway looking up, presumably thinking about E.T. in
Elliott's room. Mary comes running downstairs and tells Gertie that they
have to get into the car, otherwise they'll be late. Suddenly, Mary hears a
noise upstairs. She goes up to see what caused the sound.

[Jeopardy: E.T. is in danger of being discovered by an adult. The
audience's expectations were shaped in the earlier dinner scene, where Mary
told the children she would call to have the creature taken away if he came
around the house again. This is what the audience expects her to do if she
finds E.T.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: DAY

Mary walks into the closet and looks around. The camera pans across the
large faces of all the stuffed dolls: Raggedy Ann, a Bear, a Monkey, E.T.'s
Face, a Lion, etc. Mary doesn't notice E.T., then closes the closet door
and leaves.

[Humor is generated because of the incongruity of a living creature among
the dolls, and the inability of Mary to distinguish between them. The
laughter releases the tension that was created in the previous scene. This
also reinforces the audience's emotional ties to E.T., since he is so
"doll-like."]

INT: SCHOOL: DAY

A teacher walks down the aisle and announces to the class that today they
will perform the frog dissection for which they have been preparing. As he
passes Elliott's desk, he starts to say "frogs similar to," then he notices
the drawing of E.T. The teacher picks it up. Elliott turns to see the
pretty blonde girl staring at him. Realizing she's been caught, she quickly
turns and looks away.

[This attraction to Elliott is set up in order to payoff before the end of
the school sequence.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

E.T. opens the door to Elliott's room and walks out into the hallway.
Harvey sees and quickly approaches.

[Jeopardy: will the dog attack E.T.? At there last encounter E.T. was
frightened by Harvey.]

INTERCUT: CLASSROOM

The teacher continues his instructions, telling the students that the
scalpel is very sharp, and that they should use discretion when cutting.
There should be very little blood, and maybe a little body fluids.

[This exposition of the plans sets up the audience's expectations, which
later will not be fulfilled. This is a standard structure used to generated
excitement and unpredictability in a story.]

INT: KITCHEN: DAY

E.T., wearing a blue-flannel shirt, walks into the kitchen with Harvey at
his side. He opens the refrigerator. Harvey licks his lips as he watches in
anticipation of getting something to eat. E.T. takes out a plastic
container of potato salad, opens it, then sticks his tongue into the salad.
He hates the taste and throws it onto the floor. Harvey licks it up. E.T.
then picks up a can of beer and drinks it as Harvey barks.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott sits at his desk as he listens to the teacher speak. Elliott burps.
All the children in the classroom stare at him.

[This again shows the merging of Elliott and E.T.]

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T., drunk, wobbles across the kitchen floor and walks into a counter.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott places his fingers to his head. He is also becoming drunk. The
teacher tells the class that in this bisection they should locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

[The red-lit heart is the most prominent feature of E.T. Having the teacher
focus on the frog's heart starts the identification in the audience's mind
of the frogs and E.T.]

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. turns and walks into another wall as Harvey continues to eat the
potato salad on the floor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, now drunk, slides down in his chair.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. turns, walks, then collapses head first onto the floor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott slides under his desk and falls onto the floor. The teacher doesn't
hear this because at that moment he pulls down a wall hanging which
contains pictures of a frog's anatomy.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. opens another can of beer.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott pulls himself up off the floor with a drunken smile on his face.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. gulps down another can of beer.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, drunk, sits at his desk. He turns and smiles at the pretty blonde
girl across the aisle. She turns away from him with disgust.

INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM

E.T. plays on the keys of a voice generating language game. He next presses
a button on a remote control which activates the TV set. A cartoon appears
with a cat getting its tail caught on fire. The cat screams and E.T reacts
with horror. He throws the beer can at the TV set.

[Laughter is generated, for while this under normal circumstances would be
inappropriate behavior, he makes sense given E.T.'s point of view.]

He then presses another button on the remote, and the image of a flying
plane appears on the screen. A spaceship next appears, and pulls the plane
up towards it.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

The teacher carries a jar of cotton balls soaked in chloroform, which he
drops into the jars containing frogs. He tells the children to immediately
put the lids on the jars. After telling the children that this won't hurt
the frogs, he places a cotton ball into the last two jars, one of which
belongs to Elliott. Elliott doesn't place the cover on his jar, but instead
sadly watches as the frog tries to escape. Slowly he places to lid on it,
as he gazes at the frog.

"Say hi. Can you talk? Can you talk? Can you say hi?" says Elliott.

[Elliott is making an emotional identification of the frog with E.T. by
attempting the same process of communication. The situation also creates
expectations in the audience that similar things will happen to E.T. once
he is captured.]

CLOSEUP: FROG'S FACE

CLOSEUP: E.T.'S FACE

[A cinematic technique which reinforces the identification of the frog with
E.T. This sets up the audience for E.T.'s operation. They expect the frog
to die, and they project these expectations to E.T. later in the story.]

INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM

E.T. has a hangover as he hiccups and puts his hand on his head. He then
picks up the cartoon section of a newspaper. One cartoon strip has a
picture of a communication device with a caption stating "HELP, HELP."

On the TV monitor a woman is talking long distance n her telephone to her
Uncle Ralph in California. E.T. hears the sounds coming from the TV, then
turns to look at the monitor, where he sees a man talking into a phone in
his hand. The camera pans to a phone near E.T. A child in the TV program
picks up the phone, says hello to his uncle, then hangs up.

[This generates laughter because it's inappropriate behavior to just say
hello, then hang up.]

E.T. looks closer at the Buck Rogers cartoon. One cell has an image of a
man in a spacesuit setting up a transmitter. The next cell has him saying
"It works" as the communication device transmits "help, help!" E.T. lifts
up his head from the newspaper.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

"Save him" shouts Elliott. Elliott picks up his jar, unscrews the top, then
lets out his frog, screaming "Run for your life. Back to the forest! Run!"

[Another merging of E.T. and Elliott's feelings and thoughts. E.T.
presumably had the feeling of wanting to be saved by his friends, and this
feeling prompted Elliott to cry out.]

He next opens the jar of the girl besides him. Elliott struggles with one
student, then proceeds to turn over many of the other jars as he frees the
frogs. Some of the other children also free their frogs.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T. studies the electronic circuitry of the language game. Suddenly John
Wayne comes on the screen. E.T. is fascinated with his image. It's a scene
from the movie "QUIET MAN." Maureen O'Sullivan huddles in a corner of the
room.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

A pile of frogs gather at the feet of a terrified little girl with blonde
braids. Elliott, drunk, staggers by her.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T. continues to watch the TV monitor as the woman in the movie screams.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

A blonde girl who has a crush on Elliott screams when a frog is placed on
her shoes.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

The woman in the movie runs out the door. John Wayne grabs hold of her arm.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott grabs hold of the blonde girl as she runs out the door.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne pulls the woman back.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott pulls the blonde girl back.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne takes the woman into his arms.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott takes the blonde girl into his arms.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne kisses the woman.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, too short to kiss her, stands on the back of a student who was
crawling on the floor after a frog. Elliott kisses the girl.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T., filled with fascination, watches the TV monitor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

The children's hands poke through the windows and free the frogs by
throwing them out onto the grass.

[Elliott was able to accomplish his objective of freeing the frogs. This
sequence was structured to run in parallel in order to emphasize the
merging of Elliott and E.T.]

INT: LIVING ROOM: DAY

A blanket containing aluminum foil, electrical toys and appliances is
pulled across the floor.Mary opens the door and yells hello. Harvey runs to
the front door. E.T walks out from behind the TV and kicks beer cans across
the floor.

[The alien quickly learns the appropriate behavior for drinking at home.]

Mary, with her arms filled with grocery bags and clothes from the cleaners,
walks into the kitchen. She is followed by Gertie, who sees E.T standing
near the refrigerator. Mary opens the refrigerator door, and knocks E.T. in
the head. He falls backwards onto the floor. Gertie helps E.T. up off the
floor. He walks past Mary as he goes back to the refrigerator. Mary still
doesn't see him.

[This increases the audience's tension. They are expecting E.T. to be
discovered by Mary, and they are expecting her to scream.]

Gertie keeps telling her that she wants Mary to meet somebody, but Mary
ignores her as she talks about how much the price of food has gone up in
one week. E.T. grabs a can of coffee from the kitchen table, then again
walks past Mary as she goes in the opposite direction. He goes back into
the TV room.

[The laughter's produced by Mary's failure to see the reality of the alien
who's right under her nose.]

Gertie is watching a language teaching program for children on the TV. The
program is teaching words that begin with the letter "B". The phone rings
as Mary accidentally kicks a can of beer across the floor. She answers the
phone with the beer can in her hand. The person on the phone tells Mary
that Elliott is intoxicated.

Gertie, watching the TV monitor, responds to the program by practicing the
"B" words. E.T. pokes his head up from behind the monitor and says
"BBBBBBB." Gertie stares at him as he repeats the "B" sound, then lowers
his head back down below the TV.

"You said 'B'," says Gertie. "B," repeats E.T. "You said 'B,' good," says
Gertie. "B...GOOD," repeats E.T.

[This is a set up for the closing communication between E.T. and Gertie
before he flies away in the spacecraft. This is also the first moment that
he spoke an English word. Many children and parents in the audience can
identify with this moment, and the first moral precept usually taught to a
child: be good.]

Mary hangs up the phone and tells Gertie that she has to pick up Elliott.
She asks Gertie to be a good girl. "Mommy, he can talk," says Gertie. "Of
course he can talk," says Mary, referring to the TV program.

[The humor is generated from Mary's misunderstanding of Gertie's
statement.]

As Mary leaves, E.T. walks out from behind the TV. He walks to a phone and
stares. "Phone," says Mary. "Phone," says E.T. E.T. presses the numbers of
the phone. "You want to call somebody?" asks Gertie.

[This establishes E.T.'s objective: to communicate with his fellow
creatures so that he can return home.]

INT: HOUSE: DAY

Elliott walks up the stairs to his room. Mary's voice can be heard from
below saying she refuses to pay for frogs.

[This is a fine example of the point of attack for a scene: Instead of
showing what would happen in real life (Mary's discussions with the teacher
about Elliott's behavior in the classroom), the scene picks up with what is
important for the audience: Elliott's discovery that E.T. can now talk. A
scene showing Mary in school would be redundant and dramatically
irrelevant.]

Elliott is walking towards his room when he hears Gertie talking to E.T. in
her room. He drops his bags on the floor, and quickly enters her room.

"Be good, be good," says Gertie as she closes the doors to her closet.
Elliott pushes Gertie away from the closet and opens it. Inside is E.T.
dressed up in girl clothes with a blonde wig on his head. He has a rabbit
fur around his neck and wears a black hat with flowers.

[This is completely inappropriate attire for an alien, whether male or
female. The visual incongruity of E.T. in girl's clothes generates the
laughter.]

"Oh God!" says Elliott. "Elliott," says E.T. "What?" says Elliott, not yet
realizing that it was E.T. who spoke. "Elliott, Elliott," repeats E.T. "I
taught him how to talk. He can talk now," says Gertie.

[Elliott, with the help of Gertie and the TV program, has completed one of
Elliott's objectives: communicating with E.T.]

Gertie points out the things that E.T. has brought upstairs: electrical
toys and the plant. She wonders what he needs this for. E.T. holds the
cartoon page of the newspaper out to Elliott. "E.T., can you say that? Can
you say E.T.?" asks Elliott. "E.T.," repeats E.T. Elliott laughs with joy.
E.T keeps repeating his name as he turns and walks through the closet into
Elliott's room.

"E.T., be good," says E.T. "Be good," I taught him that too," says Gertie.

["Be good" is a fundamental value taught children, as basic as the
principle "There's no place like home," taught in the WIZARD OF OZ.]

"You should give him his dignity. This is the most ridiculous thing I've
ever seen," says Elliott.

E.T. hands Elliott the newspaper, and points to the Buck Rodgers comic
strip. He then says "PHONE". Elliott is amazed at this. E.T. walks into the
closet and says "HOME." Elliott confirms that this is E.T.'s home. E.T.
then turns, walks to the window, points to the sky, and says "E.T. HOME
PHONE."

"E.T. PHONE HOME" says Gertie. "E.T. PHONE HOME" says Elliott.

"He wants to call somebody," says Gertie.

[This reconfirms E.T.'s objective.]

Mike walks into the room and laughs at E.T.'s attire.

"E.T. Phone Home," says E.T.

"Oh my God, he's talking now," says Mike.

E.T. once again points out the window and repeats that he wants to call
home.
"And they'll come?, says Elliott.
"Come?" responds E.T. "Home, home" he repeats.

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

A truck drives down the street. Inside a man with earphones listens to the
conversations in the neighborhood homes, as he fine tunes his electronic
eavesdropping equipment. He focuses in on Elliott's voice.

[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are getting closer and closer. They
are now inside the privacy of the protagonist's home, listening to their
most intimate conversations.]

INT: GARAGE: NIGHT

Elliott, Mike and Harvey are in the garage searching for objects that E.T.
could use in building his communications device. Elliott restates that he
has "absolute power" and that E.T. belongs to him.

[Elliott's objective is to possess E.T., not set him free. Freeing the one
he loves is the lesson he will have to learn in this story.]

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

The van containing electronic eavesdropping equipment drives past Elliott's
house.

[They are still in jeopardy: their actions and words are being monitored.]

INT: GARAGE: DAY

Mike tells Elliott that E.T. doesn't look too good anymore.
"Don't say that, we're fine!" says Elliott.
"What's all this we stuff. You say we all the time now. Look Elliott,
I think he might be getting sick," replies Michael.

[This confirms Elliott's belief that he considers himself and E.T. to be
one being. It also introduces further jeopardy for E.T. Besides being
tracked by the antagonist, he is also becoming sick.]

INT: VAN: NIGHT

The man with the earphones is listening to Elliott and Michael's
conversation as they discuss E.T.'s sickness.

INT: GARAGE: DAY

Mike tells Elliott to grab the fuzzbuster. Elliott pulls his father's blue
shirt out from the shelf. They reminisce about the days when he used to
take them to baseball games and the movies, where they would have baseball
fights. Mike says that they'll do that again, but Elliott doesn't really
believe him. They each smell their father's shirt.
"Old Spice," says Mike.
"Sea Breeze," says Elliott.

[Here a prop (their father's shirt) is used to reveal the emotional
relationships between the two boys and their father. Audience empathy is
generated for them because they have been abandoned by their father. The
audience's anger is transferred from the father to the antagonist who is
eavesdropping on this private intimate moment.]

INT: VAN: NIGHT

The man in the van continues to listen to Elliott and Michael's
conversation. Only the listener's eye is clearly visible.

[This is a cinematic technique to signify the "ever-watching eye" of the
faceless antagonist.]

INT: GERTIE'S ROOM: NIGHT

Mary lies in bed next to Gertie as she reads her the Peter Pan story. Mary
reads that Peter has defeated the Indians, but Wendy and the boys have been
captured by the pirates. He vows to rescue her. E.T. watches them from the
closet.

[Here the notion of "a rescue" is introduced, and visually associated with
E.T. as he watches them from the closet. This is an emotional set up for
the audience, so that they will later be supportive of Elliott and the
boy's efforts to rescue E.T.]

Mary reads the section of the Peter Pan story where Tinker Bell becomes
poisoned. Elliott comes into the closet, stands next to E.T., then closes
the door behind them.

"Tinkerbell swallows the draft as Peter's hand reaches for it," reads Mary.
"Why T, you have drunk my medicine."

Elliott pulls E.T. away from the door, then shifts through a box of items
that he brought up from the garage. He cuts his finger on the blade of a
power saw, then says "OUCH," as he holds his bleeding finger up into the
air. E.T. points his own finger towards Elliott. E.T.'s finger glows like a
laser light as he says "ouch." He then presses this lit finger on Elliott's
cut and heals it.

[This establishes the fundamental goodness and healing power of E.T.]

E.T. opens the slit in the closet door and continues to watch Mary read to
Gertie the part where Tinker Bell is dying.

"She says she thinks she can get well again if children believe in fairies.
Do you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe."
"I DO! I DO! I DO!" says Gertie.
"If you believe, clap your hands."
Both Gertie and Mary clap their hands. Elliott places a blanket around
E.T.'s shoulders and a scarf around his neck, as they listen to the rest of
the story.
"Thank you, thank you. And now to rescue Wendy," reads Mary. Elliott places
his arm around E.T.

[The Peter Pan story is used to set up the audience's emotional reactions
to a fairy tale concerning near death and rescue. This emotional empathy
will then be transferred to E.T., another "fairy-like creature" when he
becomes sick and is rescued. Just as the audience felt like clapping for
Tinker Bell, they will applaud the children's efforts to save E.T.]

EXT: HOUSE: NIGHT

Exhaust flows from the tailpipe of a van. This is the same type of
poisonous exhaust image that the audience saw when vans drove into the
forest at the beginning of the movie.

[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are still nearby.]

INT: BEDROOM: NIGHT

Elliott, dressed in white long-johns, sits on his bunkbed as he watches
E.T. Michael stands next to him. Elliott comments that E.T. is putting
together his instrument, while Mike fears that it might blow up the house.
He also comments on the irregularity of E.T.'s breathing.

[More jeopardy, both in Mike's fears of his family and home being
destroyed, and in E.T.'s illness becoming progressively worse.]

E.T places his communication device over the Buck Rodgers comic strip.

[This movement establishes a mental association between the device and the
spaceman's communication efforts in the comic strip.]

Petals drop off the flower in the pot.

[This represents E.T.'s failing health.]

E.T. lifts up his head (which indicates he's using his telekinetic powers),
then lifts part of his communication device into the air. He next lifts up
the umbrella and opens it. Both objects float in the air in front of him.

[E.T's primary objective is to go home. To accomplish this he must create a
communication device. This is his sub-objective, which appears to be
completed. He next must activate this device from the landing site and call
home. The obstacles he has to overcome are Mary, the community, and the
distance to the forest. These obstacles will be confronted in the next
scenes.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Preparing for Halloween, Elliott paints his lips with makeup. He talks to
Gertie about her going out that night as a ghost. They review the evening
plans. She will meet them at the lookout.

[This is an example of incomplete exposition which engages the audience.
They only talk about part of the plan: the meeting at the lookout. They
don't discuss anymore details, such as deceiving Mary into thinking that
Gertie is with them instead of E.T. The partial information forces the
audience to stay involved with the action and to create their own
conjectures about what will happen.]

INT: CLOSET: DAY

Mike helps Elliot put on his knapsack. Elliott then places a sheet over
E.T.

INT: STAIRCASE: DAY

E.T., covered with a sheet and clown shoes, walks down the staircase. The
clown shoes cover his three-toed feet.

INT: HOUSE: DAY

Mary walks through the house dressed in a tight fitting leopard skin dress
with facial makeup that makes her look like a cat. Mike tells his mother to
wait and not peek, as he and Elliott lead E.T. into the room. Finally, Mary
turns and shrieks with glee. She runs to get a camera.

[The tension in the situation is caused by their fear that E.T. will be
discovered by Mary. Mike and Elliott's objective is to get him out of the
house undiscovered.]

E.T. looks through holes cut out for his eyes and sees Michael with a fake
butcher knife through his head. He lights up his finger in an attempt to
heal Mike's wound. Mike grab's E.T.'s hand and puts it back under the
sheet. "Ouch, ouch" says E.T, as he tries once again to heal Mike. "It's a
fake knife, it's fake," says Mike.

[Laughter is generated because while E.T.'s behavior would be appropriate
if Mike was really wounded, it is inappropriate in this situation since the
knife is fake.]

Mary comes back with a camera and prepares to photograph them.

"You look great," says Mary.
"Thank you," says Mike.
"Thank you," says Elliott.
"Thank you," says E.T.
Mary doesn't notice that E.T. has spoken.

[Laughter is generated by the "rule of three" humor structure and Mary's
ignorance.]

When Mary takes the photo, the flash shocks E.T. and knocks him onto the
floor. Mike and Elliott quickly pull him up before Mary notices and lead
him out of the house.

[They succeed in their objective with the help of their "not so smart"
mother.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mary walks down the driveway as she orders them to be home no later than
one-hour after sundown. E.T., dressed in the sheet, turns and looks at
Mary, then continues down the driveway with Mike and Elliott.

[This creates a "timelock", a sense of urgency, and the expectation of an
upset mother if they haven't returned by the assigned time.]

EXT: COMMUNITY: DAY

Establishing shot of the neighborhood. On a hilltop by a fence stands
another person in a white sheet (presumably Gertie). She kicks dirt at the
bicycle near the fence.

[This is the end objective of Mike, Elliot and E.T.: to connect up with
Gertie at the lookout. Their obstacle is to get E.T past all the children
on the streets.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

The sun is setting. Children in Halloween costumes walk through the
streets. E.T. walks between Mike and Elliott, as he watches the other
children parade by. One child dressed as YODA from RETURN OF THE JEDI walks
by. E.T. turns and walks after him saying "HOME,HOME."

[The laughter is obviously the result of E.T. misinterpreting the situation
by believing that the child is another alien.]

They walk towards the setting sun as Mike reminds Elliott that he must be
back by one hour after sunset. Elliott promises to try, but he wants Mike
to cover for him.

[This creates jeopardy for the characters, because if they don't complete
their mission within the time frame, they will have trouble with Mary.]

EXT: HILLTOP: DAY

The sun is setting as Mike, Elliott, and two small characters covered with
sheets stand on the hilltop overlooking the city. Elliott asks Mike to help
him lift E.T. onto the bike. Mike does and then tells Elliott that they
will be waiting for him.

[They have reached this objective. The next objective for Elliott and E.T
is to get to the landing site in the forest.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Elliott, with E.T sitting in the front basket, rides his bicycle through
the forest. The road becomes very bumpy. Elliott tells E.T. that they will
have to walk from there. Suddenly, E.T. takes control of the bike through
the use of his telekinetic powers and speeds it forward. Eliott becomes
frightened as E.T. speeds the bike towards a cliff and then drives it over
the edge. E.T. then makes the bike up through the air.

[The audience gulps from suspense and then goes into elation by this
surprising and magical turn of events.]

They continue to fly over the tree tops. Elliott yells "Not so high, not so
high."

[E.T and Elliott both have white hoods over their heads, which further
visually reinforces their identification.]

They ride across the front of the moon, the guiding light of magic. Elliott
laughs with glee. When they start their descent he begs E.T. not to crash.
They hit the ground. The bike turns over, and both E.T. and Elliott are
thrown to the ground.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

The grandfather clock indicates 9:45. Mary watches the clock as she sits in
front of lighted candles. The time has long passed when Elliott was
supposed to be home. The lighted candles give a church like effect as if
Mary was praying for the safety of her children. She is upset that they
haven't returned. She blows out the candles, then taps out another candle
with her wand.

[There is jeopardy for the children as Mary and the audience wonder if they
are okay. Empathy is generated for Mary who is truly concerned for the
safety of her children.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

The sun has set. It's nighttime in the forest. E.T opens a box which
contains the saw blade brought to him by Elliott. Elliott ties a rope up to
a tree branch. He then opens the umbrella which is lined with aluminum foil
and points it towards the star-filled sky. It will function as a
transmitter. E.T. places a coat hanger with nails above the saw blade,
plugs a cable into a battery, then activates the toy language teaching
device.

[They succeeded in completing their objective to reach the landing site.
Their new objective is to communicate with E.T.'s fellow aliens in order to
accomplish E.T.'s primary objective, which is to return home.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Mary, still dressed in her leopard outfit, leaves the house. She is very
upset that her children have not yet returned home. She mumbles to herself,
sticks the wand in her mouth, and shakes the car keys. She gets into the
car and mumbles that their father is going to hear about this one.
"Mexico!" she says. She drives down the driveway and into the street to
search for her children.

[This creates more empathy for Mary, who is very upset that her small
children are out this late. The parents in the audience can easily identify
with her. But the real function of this scene is to get her out of the
house so that the antagonist can invade their home. She could have stayed
inside, we never see her in the car searching for the children, and the
next time we do see her is by the refrigerator in the kitchen.]

Men get out of a parked car as Mary drives away. They take suitcases out of
a second car, then walk up the driveway to Elliott's house.

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

Elliott watches the treetops sway. He scratches his face, as does E.T.
Together they stare at the stars. The wind causes the branch to sway, which
then pulls the rope, which, in turn, pulls a fork across the saw blade.
This drags the nails in the hanger across the flat surface of the blade,
and sends signals out into space. Elliott is overjoyed and shouts that it
works, while E.T. repeats the word "Home." Together they gaze up to the
stars.

[They have accomplished their objective of sending a message into space.
Now, they wait to receive a signal back.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

The light from a flashlight crosses in front of a pumpkin's face. More
light floods through the slits of Gertie's door. A hand holding a
flashlight opens Gertie's door, and shines the light into the face of a
black doll.

[This has an irritating and frightening effect on anyone in the audience
who has ever had the experience of having a light shined into their face.]

Light from the flashlight searches around Gertie's room.

INT: HALLWAY: NIGHT

A pile of yellow electrical cord is stacked on the floor near a chair. It
slowly unwinds as it is pulled by someone in Elliott's room. The door to
Elliott's room is shut, with a poster sign hanging on it saying "DO NOT
ENTER." The silhouette of a man passes behind the door, as sounds of a
Geiger counter filter into the air. Muffled voices are heard as the cord is
pulled to its fullest extent. It forces a chair to slam against the wall.

[This last action has a jarring effect on the audience. Emotionally, the
audience is outraged at the invasion of the children's rooms, and this
creates hatred for the antagonist and his cohorts. They are still faceless
so the audience can project the face of the persons they most hate onto
these characters. This personalizes the story for them and gets them more
intensely involved on an emotional basis. They also become intellectually
involved, because the sounds of the Geiger counter and the extension of the
cord to its maximum length forces them to infer that the antagonist has
found E.T.'s "home" in the closet. This involves the audience in the story
much more than if the filmmaker had shown the antagonist poking around in
the closet.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

"We have to go now E.T. It's so late already," Elliott says as both he and
E.T. sadly gaze into the sky.

[Their objective of receiving a return signal has not been achieved. Their
sadness at failure creates empathy for them in the audience.]

Elliott coughs from being out in the cold, damp air.

[This is a setup for the later scenes when both Elliott and E.T. are
deathly ill.]

Elliott repeats that they really have to go home, but E.T. ignores him and
has a sad expression on his face as he stares up to the sky. Elliott tells
them that he has to give them some time. E.T. responds by saying "ouch,"
signifying that he feels pain. A small fawn watches them from a distance.

[The jeopardy in the scene is due to their being so late. Mary will be very
angry and they face the obstacle of getting E.T. back into the house
without being discovered. The fawn generates feelings of sympathy in the
audience which is transferred to E.T. The audience also empathizes with the
sadness they feel at failing to make contact. For now, supposedly, E.T.
won't be able to go home.]

"You could be happy here. I could take care of you," says Elliott
tearfully. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together,
E.T."

[Elliott states his primary objective: to always have E.T. with him.]

"Home, Home," says E.T.

[E.T. states his primary objective: to go home.]

Elliott sits down and cries. E.T. touches one of his tears.

[The audience empathizes with the sadness of both characters.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

It's morning. Elliott is asleep as he leans against a large rock. He is
covered with a blanket as the wet forest mist surrounds him. Next to him
lies E.T.'s communication device.

Elliott coughs, gets up, tugs on the rope which activates the device, then
looks around for E.T. but can't find him.

[The new objective: where is E.T. and what has happened to him? This is
also the new question that will maintain the audience's interest.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary opens the refrigerator door and puts back a carton of milk. Mike and
Gertie sit besides her. A policeman asks Mary how Elliott was dressed when
she last saw him. Mary tells him that he was dressed as a hunchback. The
policeman, whose face is not shown (I suppose so that the audience will
associate him as "one of them"), asks Mary if there is any indication that
he might have run away? Were there any family problems or recent arguments?
Mary explains that she and her husband had just separated and that this has
not been easy on the kids.

"My father is in Mexico," says Gertie.

[This scene generates empathy for the whole family.]

Mary slams the refrigerator door shut, thereby revealing Elliott standing
behind it. White light floods onto him making him look ghastly. Mary hugs
him as Mike and Gertie join them.

[The audience is relieved and overjoyed with Elliott's safe return.]

"Oh Elliott," she says as she hugs him. "Don't ever do this again, Elliott.
You're so hot."

Elliott is feverish from spending the night outside. Mary tells Gertie to
go upstairs and draw him a bath. Mary walks over to the policeman (whose
face is still unseen) and thanks him for his concern.

Elliott asks Mike if E.T. is in the house. Mike shakes his head, indicating
no. Elliot pleads with Mike to find him. He's somewhere in the forest near
the bald spot.

[This is the new objective: find E.T. and bring him back.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mike rides the bicycle with the basket in front down the driveway and into
the street, past a car filled with waiting men. The car starts and follows
Mike. He looks behind and realizes that he is being pursued.

[This is a standard chase scene, with a friend who is trying to save the
life of the protagonist being pursued. Both he and the protagonist are in
jeopardy. Mike's new sub-objective is to lose those who are following him.]

Mike cuts through a backyard and into an alley behind some houses. The car
follows him. Mike then rides up an embankment and drives off in the
opposite direction, leaving the car stranded behind.

[He successfully accomplished his subobjective.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Mike rides through the forest as he calls out E.T.'s name. He stops and
searches for E.T. Mike finds the abandoned communication device, then runs
up a path and discovers E.T.'s white sheet hanging from the open gate.

[The blue-orange colors of E.T.'s communication device are the same colors
that Spielberg chose the logo of his production company, AMBLIN
ENTERTAINMENT.]

[This is the same gate near the landing site that the characters ran past
in the opening sequence.]

In another part of the forest, Mike rides his bike on a ridge above a
stream. E.T lies in the water below, is skin discolored to that of sickly
white. Mike sees him, grabs the sheet, then runs down the embankment. A
raccoon wanders near E.T. Mike shouts him away, then covers E.T. Mike hears
the sounds of a helicopter above him and looks up at the sky.

[Mike has achieved his objective: he has found E.T. But, danger hovers
above him in the unseen presence of the ever observing antagonist.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

The shadow of a man falls on the driveway. The sound of keys jangling is
heard.

[High jeopardy: the antagonist is about to invade the home of the
protagonist.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mike is in the hallway as Mary walks up the stairs. She has a cup of coffee
in her hand.

[The cup is a prop which will be used to reveal Mary's emotions.]

He wants her to come with him. He asks her if she remembers the goblin. He
tries to get her to make a promise, but she is annoyed with him.

INT: BATHROOM: DAY

Michael then opens the door to the bathroom. Elliott is sitting on the
floor as Gertie sits on the counter. They are both looking into the
bathtub. Mary smiles as she walks into the bathroom with the cup of coffee
in her hand. Then she sees E.T. on the floor. He is a sickly white. He
extends his arms out towards her. Mary is stunned, as she turns the cup
over and coffee pours out onto the floor.

[Here a character's non-verbal action with a prop reveals her true
emotional state. She has lost it.]

"He's sick. I think we're dying," says Elliott. Mary covers her mouth. Mike
tries to tell her that E.T. won't harm them, but she orders him to take
Gertie downstairs. Gertie cries that he's the man from the moon as Mike
picks her up and carries her downstairs.

[Elliott, clothed only in white long-john underwear, is visually almost
identical to the ghastly white-colored E.T.]

Mary picks up Elliott and carries him out of the room as E.T. groans and
reaches out for them.

[Mary's objective is to save her family from the alien in her home.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary carries Elliott down the stairs. He protests that she can't leave E.T.
alone. Michael runs down the stairs with Gertie on his back. He opens the
door, freezes, then backs away. Mary, with Elliott in her arms, approaches
the door and is confronted by a man in a spacesuit.

Mary backs into the living room as the spaceman enters and reaches out for
her. She goes in the opposite direction, only to run into another man in a
spacesuit. She runs into the kitchen, followed by Mike carrying Gertie. The
are blocked by still another spaceman with outstretched arms. Mary and her
children are backed into a corner. Another man in a spacesuit opens up the
window blinds from the outside. Mary shouts "THIS IS MY HOME."

EXT: STREET: DAY

Dawn. The sun rises as a line of men wearing helmets and uniforms march up
the street.

INT: BATHROOM: DAY

E.T., his skin discolored to a grey-white hue, lies on the floor as a man
in a space suit enters the room. "Home," says E.T.

[This is the end of act two. The antagonist and his forces have invaded the
home of the protagonist and taken them into possession. This terrifying
invasion of the privacy of their home generates more empathy for Mary and
her children.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Men in helmets walk up a street as they push a large plastic tunnel. Police
cars slowly drive up the street, as faceless men march to a drumbeat.

[This is the beginning of the third act with the forces of the antagonist
in complete control.]

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

Men with welding torches work on a truck. The plastic tunnel leads up the
driveway to Elliott's house. The faces of the men are still not shown. They
are either wearing helmets or are silhouettes.

CLOSEUP

The man with keys jangling on his side is putting on a pair of light-blue
pants.

INTERCUT: STREET

Men are working outside. Large bright lights flood the area.

INTERCUT: "KEYS"

The man in the blue suit puts on a white pair of plastic gloves. Red and
black colors on his cuff are associated with his keys as ominous music
fills the soundtrack.

[This is the only instance in this film where the traditional colors of the
antagonist (red and black) are associated with the antagonist ("keys").
Putting on a light-blue outfit starts the transformation of the antagonist
into a character worthy of audience empathy, for blue-white is the
traditional production design colors signifying "innocence."]

The man in the light-blue suit gets up walks through the plastic tunnel
towards Elliott's house. He exits the tunnel and walks into the house which
has been completely enclosed by plastic.

Finally, the antagonist's face is shown. His head is covered by a blue hood
while a light under his face mask accentuates his white shirt.

Mary stands in the middle of the room with Gertie at her side. A doctor
asks her questions about E.T., but Mary is more concerned with Elliott's
state. A nurse cuts a lock from Gertie's hair (presumably for analysis),
while both Elliott and E.T. can be seen on a video monitor. This nurse
walks to Mike and cuts a piece of his hair while a doctor asks him
questions about E.T. A video monitor shows Elliott and E.T. "Elliott thinks
his thoughts," asks the doctor. "No, Elliott feels his feelings," answers
Michael.

[This is the first time in the film that the merging of Elliott and E.T.
has been explicitly stated. Yet, this condition has been revealed to the
audience non-verbally throughout the story. The verbalization seems
redundant and not necessary, but does make sense as an explanatory comment
to a character new to the story.]

INT: CHAMBER: DAY

A man stands in what appears to be a decontamination chamber.

INTERCUT: MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS

Hands push buttons on electronic equipment used to gather medical
information about Elliott and E.T. Graphs representing E.T. and Elliott run
in exact parallel.

[This is another representation of the fact that E.T. and Elliott have
merged and are to be considered as one being.]

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

Two people in white suits zip open a plastic covering and enter the room
where Elliot and E.T. are being examined.

[The color white traditionally signifying purity. A transition in the
audience's emotional alliances is being manipulated at this stage of the
story. Their hatred will be transferred from "keys" who will become much
more sympathetic to "death itself" which threatens the life of E.T. It
would be too much to ask of the adult audience to remain sympathetic to the
emotional pleadings of a child when space scientists are trying to save the
life of a sick alien.]

"You're scaring him," cries Elliott, as the doctors examine both Elliott
and E.T. as they lie on adjacent tables. E.T's head rests on a blue piece
of cloth.

"Leave him alone, leave him alone. I can take care of him," moans Elliott.

[Which, of course, he can't. But this is something that both he, and
probably most of the children in the audience, really believe.]

Elliott looks up into the face of "Keys," who says that he's been to the
forest. He wants to know what the machine does. Elliott says that it's a
communication machine, and asks if it's still working. He then states that
"He came to me. He came to me." "Keys" explains that he's been wishing for
this too, ever since he was ten years old. He doesn't want the alien to
die. He asks what more can they do that they are not already doing.

Elliott's image reflects in "Keys" face gear. Elliott tells him that E.T.
was calling his people because he needs to go home.

["Keys" is no longer the threat. He has been transformed into a friend who
also wants to help the alien. A new antagonist must now be created in order
to maintain conflict in the story. In this scene DEATH will serve that
function. For the rest of the film the forces of the United States
Government, who attempt to block E.T.'s escape, will function as the
antagonist.]

Another Doctor dressed in white enters the room and announces that E.T. has
DNA. Suddenly, a display screen shows a drop in E.T. and Elliott's graphs.
One doctor says there's a drop in the creature's blood temperature, while
another states that Elliott's condition is stabilizing: his blood pressure
is coming back up.

E.T. calls Elliott's name, and the medical personnel become aware that he
can talk. Elliott pleads with him to stay. E.T. repeats the words "stay,
stay," then slowly turns his head away.

Their graphs separate. One doctor announces that the boy is coming back,
but they are losing E.T.

INT: CLOSET: NIGHT

Michael enters the closet space where E.T. stayed. He looks at the objects,
including the cartoon page from the newspaper, then huddles down among
E.T.'s possessions.

[These actions create more empathy for Michael who suffers at the thought
of losing E.T.]

The is a time transition, for Michael is asleep in E.T.'s space when the
morning sun shines on his face. Michael wakes up, then watches the plant
(which represents E.T.'s life force) wilt. He screams.

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

"E.T., don't go" screams Elliott.

Doctors state that he has no blood pressure and there is no pulse or
respiration. A bell rings, which signifies a life and death situation.
Doctors run into the room and tear down the plastic coverings surrounding
E.T.

"Leave him alone. You're killing him," says Elliott. They wheel Elliott out
of the room as he continues to scream. The medical staff frantically tries
to revive E.T. They try electrical shocks, but that fails. Gertie holds her
doll as she watches. She reacts by jumping when the electrical shocks are
applied to E.T.

[Showing one character's reactions to a situation help to create the
intended reaction in the audience.]

The doctors are losing him. Elliott watches and cries. Mary goes to him and
they hug each other. Gertie cries as she holds her doll. Mike walks into
the room, as "Keys" watches, then turns away.

[This provides the audience with each character's reaction to the death of
E.T. This is a surprising event for the audience: the protagonist has died.
Emotionally, it was designed to sadden the audience so that they will
become overjoyed when he is brought back to life.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

A white van awaits at the bottom of the driveway.

[Previously, the vans and cars associated with the antagonist were of dark
colors. The color changes allows the filmmaker to use culturally determined
color associations to manipulate the audience's emotional responses.]

Police and other officials walk past a white van, white truck, police cars
and other white vehicles towards a tan colored car. Mike's friends sit on
their bikes behind police barriers. They make comments that something has
just happened inside the house.

[This establishes the existence of Mike's friends who will play a crucial
role in the last chase scene.]

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

The medical staff gives up on E.T. and decide to pack him in ice. Mike
watches as the staff of E.T. slowly walks away. "Keys" removes his headgear
and walks to Elliott who is standing vigil over E.T.'s body. "Keys" then
approaches E.T. Mike watches and cries as a man behind him removes his
headgear. The faces of several medical attendants are shown.

[This humanizes the forces of the antagonist and makes them much less
threatening. That's why they had to be faceless for so long throughout the
story.]

"Keys" kneels besides E.T. and with gloved hand closes his eyes. Mary holds
Gertie. When Gerite asks if he's dead, Mary replies that she thinks so.
Gertie then says she wishes him back.

[The interchange between Gertie and Mary reminds the audience of the Tinker
Bell situation when Mary read to her from Peter Pan. Those same feelings
are reintroduced here: the clapping of hands to save the fairy and then the
desire to rescue the children. This is the payoff to the emotional
reactions set up in that earlier scene.]

"Keys" looks up to see two attendants roll in a metal casing filled with
ice into which they will place E.T.'s body.

Mary picks up Gertie and carries her out of the room. Medical technicians
prepare the casing as Elliott watches. Keys approaches Elliot and tells him
that they will be taking E.T. away. "They are just going to cut him all
up," replies Elliott.

[This is the payoff to the frog sequence. The audience believes that
Elliott is correct, given the scientific mind as demonstrated by the
teacher. They also now remember the joy they felt when Elliott freed the
frogs, and wish they could experience that again now.]

"Do you want to spend some time alone with him?" asks "Keys," as he puts
his arm around Elliott and walks him to the casing. He tells the medical
attendants to leave the room.

[This generates empathy for "Keys" who is shown to be concerned for
Elliott's feelings.]

The attendants walk out of the room past Michael who is watching Elliott.
"Keys" leaves Elliott alone with the body of E.T., which is covered in a
plastic bag as it lies on dry ice. Elliott stares down at E.T.

"Look at what they've done to you. I'm so sorry. You must be dead. I... I
didn't know how to feel. I can't feel anything anymore. You've gone
someplace else now. E.T., I love you."

[Elliott wears a partially open white-jacket. He is framed within an oval
shaped glass.]

Elliott places the cover down over E.T. and walks away from the oval glass.
A red-light flashes from inside the casing, but Elliott doesn't notice this
as he walks away. He passes the pot of wilted flowers. The flowers slowly
start to regain strength. Elliott notices this, then quickly returns the
casing.

[This is the payoff for the pot-of-wilted-flowers prop.]

He opens the casing, sees the red-light flashing from E.T.'s heart, then
zips open the plastic bag. The alien looks up and says "E.T. phone home."
Elliott screams with joy.
"Home, home, home, home," says E.T.
"Does this mean they are coming?" asks Elliott.
"Yes," answers E.T.

[E.T. has finally succeeded in his objective of communicating home.]

Elliott tells him to stay and shut up, as he places his hand over E.T.'s
mouth. Elliott zips him back up, then places a cloth over his flashing
red-heart, as "KEYS" re-enters the room. Elliott slams down the cover.
"KEYS" pulls Elliott away from the case as two attendants prepare for its
removal. Elliott cries out with feigned sorrow to conceal his glee when he
sees the wilted flowers regain their health. The attendants lock the case.

INT: DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER: DAY

Elliott tells Mike that E.T. is alive. Mike's also overjoyed. Mike and
Elliott rejoice as the wilted flowers continue to bloom.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary is talking to "KEYS" as Gertie runs up with the pot of flowers in her
hands. He asks Mary if the boys have gone because she's sup- posed to give
her a note when they have gone. Mary takes the note from Gertie and reads
it.

[This note provides the crisis to which Mary must react, yet the audience
is kept in suspense.]

EXT: PLASTIC TUNNEL: DAY

Elliott runs down the tunnel past two men dressed in blue, then enters the
back of the van. Elliott then pulls aside the white curtains that separate
the drivers compartment from the back of the van to reveal Michael in the
driver's seat. He to is wearing a blue jacket. Elliott yells at Mike for
not wearing his mask. Suddenly, a black official walks by the van, spots
Mike in the driver's seat, and knocks on the window. He holds a
walkie-talkie in his hand as he asks Mike who he is. Mike responds that
he's driving. The official tells Mike to open the door. When Mike looks to
Elliott for advice, Elliott tells him to drive away.

[Elliott and Mike's objective is to escape with E.T.]

A group of men approach the van. Mike screams that he's never driven
forward before, shifts into first gear, and drives away.

[This is the payoff to the scene of Mike incompetently backing the car down
the driveway.]

As Mike drives away he drags along the plastic tunnel with the two men
still inside. Mike briefly stops by his friends and tells them to meet him
at the playground at the top of he hill. He then drives away, pursued by a
group of men. Mike's friends put on their hats and sun- glasses, and join
the fray.

[The chase is on. Suspense is created because the audience wonders whether
they will get E.T. back to the forest before the are stopped. They face
impossible odds, yet Mike's friends display loyalty as they join the fight.
Mike and Elliott's first objective is to reach the park. Their major
obstacle is the men trying to capture them.]

Mike drives the van down the street. The two men still in the plastic
tunnel try to climb back towards the van. Elliott starts to disconnect the
tunnel by pulling out metal braces.

[Jeopardy: If these men get into the van, they will overpower Elliott and
Mike, and prevent E.T. from getting home.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary backs her car out of the garage. Gertie is sitting next to her in the
front seat holding onto the flower pot. "Keys" runs up to Mary and asks
where she's going. Gertie blunts out "to the spaceship."

["Keys" now realizes that the aliens are returning for E.T. This is his
"crisis" information, that spurns him into action.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

The van continues down the road, still pulling the plastic tunnel behind
it. The two men have almost made it to the back of the van as Elliott pulls
out the final stake. He tosses it to one of the men. When Mike turns a
sharp corner the plastic tunnel disconnects, leaving the two men behind.

[They have overcome their immediate obstacle. Humor is generated when
Elliott tosses the nail to one of the men, because it is the reversal of a
life saving situation. Instead of catching something (like a rope) that
will save him, he catches the object that is his undoing.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

A convoy of police cars drive up a street.

[The chase is still on. Even though one obstacle has been overcome, the
antagonist brings more formidable forces into the fight. The protagonist is
still in jeopardy.]

EXT: PARK: DAY

The white van drives up over the sidewalk and into the park. It swerves
between the children's rides, then finally stops. Smoke pours out of the
van, whose back two doors are still open.

[They have reached their sub-objective: the park where they are to meet up
with Mike's friends and continue on their bikes.]

Mike's friends wait on their bikes. Between them they also have bikes for
Elliott and Mike. E.T. is revealed to the boys. He stands among the smoke
from the dry-ice with his red-heart light flashing. "Okay, he's a man from
outer space and we're taking him to his spaceship," says Elliott, now
dressed in blue pants, white shirt, and red jacket.
"Why can't he just beam up?" asks Greg.
"This is reality, Greg," says Elliott.

[Of course, the joke is that it isn't reality. It is a fantasy movie with a
realistic response to a fantastic situation. Right?]

[Elliott finally wins the respect and admiration of Mike's friends,
something he's desired from his introduction scene when they wouldn't allow
him to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS with them.]

EXT: PARK: DAY

Mary, along with a crowd of plain clothes police, run towards the van.
"Don't shoot, they're only children," screams Mary.

[This introduces a life and death jeopardy into the scene. It also
characterizes the forces of the antagonist as characters who would shoot
children.]

They reach the back of the van only to find it empty.

EXT: STREET: DAY

Elliott and friends ride down the street. E.T., covered with a white
blanket, rides in Elliott's basket. Elliott, with the red hood over his
head, shouts that they are to ride to the forest.

[To cloth a character in red is effective in chase scenes. This helps the
audience to visually pick out the scenes important character when the pace
is fast and the action intense. Spielberg used this technique for Elliot in
this scene and for Marion in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK when she runs through
the market chased by Arabs.]

Cars chase them. Elliott rides up the alley and tells the others to follow
him. Police cars encircle them and try to cut them off. The bikers turn off
the main road and ride into a dirt field. A tan car with "UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT" written on the driver's door rides parallel to the bikers.

Two men ride inside the tan car. One speaks into the car radio saying that
they'll get them at the bottom of the hill. The tan car pulls into the base
of the hill and stops. One man gets out and starts to climb up the
embankment. The bikers almost run him over. They ride over the hood of the
car, then continue down the street, now pursued by a blue police car.

The bikers cycle down a dirt road of a section of the community that is
still under development. E.T., with the white blanket covering his head,
sits in the basket of Elliott's bike. A blue car trails them. The bikers
decide to split up. Two ride down an embankment. They are followed by
another police car. The bikers then escape from their pursuers by riding
down steep embankments. The cars cannot follow and must stop on different
levels. The bikers unite and ride away.

[It seems that the chase is over and they have eluded the antagonist.]

The biker's are overjoyed by their victory. One takes off his hat, waves it
in the air, and shouts "We've made it!" Suddenly, he quickly ducks to avoid
being grabbed by a man. A group of men continue the chase. Several cars
pull up ahead and form a blockade in the road.

Elliott and E.T. ride forward. Horror grows on Elliott's face as he stares
at the enemy in front of him.

[This final confrontation between the protagonist (Elliott and E.T.) and
the antagonist.]

The antagonist is explicitly revealed at this moment. On the side panel of
a car is a sign stating:

                           FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
                              U.S. GOVERNMENT
                           INTERAGENCY MOTOR POOL
                                    GSA

The shadow of a shotgun covers the sign. Next, two shotguns are raised
against E.T. and Elliott.

Elliott shuts his eyes with fear. There is a closeup of E.T.'s face. With
shotguns drawn, government agents gesture for them to stop.

[This is the life and death final moment before the climax. The audience
has been set up to expect that the government agents would shoot at the
protagonist by Mary's comments in the park scene.]

Suddenly, E.T. saves the day with his telekinetic powers. He lifts all of
the bikers up into the air as they fly above the blockade.

[The climax is over E.T. has saved himself and his friends]

E.T. then flies the bikers over the housetops, and across the setting sun.
Finally they float down onto a path in the forest.

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Elliott has reached the landing site. He brushes the leaves away from the
turntable of the communication device. A blue-light floods Elliott's face.
He looks up into the, along with the other bikers. E.T., with red-heart
happily flashing, also gazes into the sky as his spaceship descends.
"Home," says E.T.
The spaceship continues its descent as E.T.'s red-heart flutters. The
spaceship finally lands in a golden glowing light.

A car pulls into the forest, and Gertie's voice can be heard pointing out
the location of the boys. The ramp to the spaceship lowers. Gertie runs up
to Mike and E.T. She gives E.T. the plant and says that she just wanted to
say goodbye. Michael responds that E.T. doesn't know goodbye.
"Be good," says E.T.
"Yes," says Gertie, as she kisses him on the nose.
Mike places his hand on E.T.'s head.

[This is a basic gesture of trust. The fact that E.T. allows Mike to do
this indicates that he considers him a friend.]

E.T. puts the plant on the ground, as Mary and "Keys" run up to the edge of
the site. Mike picks up Gertie and carries her away as Elliott approaches
E.T.

"Come," says E.T
"Stay," says Elliott.

[The two characters that had merged into one protagonist must split apart
because they now have different primary objectives. E.T. want's to return
home, and Elliott wants him to remain.]

E.T. lifts his finger to his lips and says "ouch."

[Of course, this indicates the pain he feels in their separation.]

Elliott tearfully lifts his finger to his lips and says "ouch."

[The symmetry of his movements indicate that in some sense, they still are
one.]

E.T. and Elliott hug each other as the are visually surrounded by blue and
white lights. Then Elliott and Mary exchange glances as Mike and Gertie
stand by and watch. E.T. lifts his finger to Elliott's forehead. It lights
up, then he says: "I'll be right here."

[The resolution of the dilemma. Though E.T. leaves, he will still remain,
perhaps telepathically, or perhaps only within Elliott's thoughts.]

"Bye," says Elliott..

E.T. picks up the potted plant and carries it up the gangplank. Elliott
watches from below as Harvey starts up the plank, then returns to Elliott's
side.

[E.T. leaves with what he really came for, a sample of the earth's
vegetative life form. But now he has much more in the flowers that will
serve as a memorial of all that he has experienced with his new friends.]

The gangplank lifts up and separates E.T. from Elliott. The ships circular
entrance closes. The spaceship lifts off. Elliott watches it float up into
the sky. It then speeds away, leaving an orange-blue rainbow behind against
the blue-morning sky.

[Orange and blue were also the colors of E.T.'s makeshift communication
device as found by Mike in the forest.]

Mary watches and laughs with happiness. The other boys also watch, as Mike
holds Gertie in his arms. The film ends with a shot of Elliott gazing up
into the sky.

				OLD KIM
		Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.
		
				OLD KIM
		Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would 
		have to start with scissors.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		Scissors?
		
				OLD KIM
		Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once 
		there was even a man who had scissors for 
		hands.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		A man?
		
				OLD KIM
		Yes.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		Hands, scissors?
		
				OLD KIM
		No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top 
		of the mountain?
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		It's haunted.
		
				OLD KIM
		Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in 
		that mansion. He made many things, I suppose. 
		He also created a man. He gave him inside, a 
		heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost 
		everything. You see, the inventor was very old. 
		He died before he got to finish the man he 
		invented. So the man was left by himself, 
		incomplete and all alone.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		He didn't have a name?
		
				OLD KIM
		Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward.

				A WOMAN
		Joyce, I just saw this strange guy drop in with

				JOYCE
		Yes, I'll be right there.

		All dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior

		will see what we can find to wear. You know 
		what? I think I have some of Bill's old clothes 
		in here. This is perfect. Here. These should 
		just fit you. 
			(The phone rings.)
		Oh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a 
		phone. Now you can go in Kim's room and put 
		these on. I'll be right with you.
		
				PEG
		No, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was 
		born up there or something. Have you seen him 
		before? No, I don't think he's been off the

		you get together with him? I have to go. I'll 
		talk to you later Margie, Bye-bye.
			(to Edward)
		I'm sorry Edward, I didn't... oh, dear. May I 
		help you with this?
		
				EDWARD
		Thank you.
		
				PEG
		There you go. Oh, dear, you've cut your face. 
		Let me get this right off. Does that hurt? 
		Okay. No, good. Now let's get you dressed. 
		Okay. There we go. Very fine. You look fine,

		You've got rollers in your damn hair.
		
				PEG
		Okay. Now what did I do with my sci... Edward, 
		um, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor 
		friend who I think could help you.
		
				EDWARD
		Really?
		
				PEG
		Yes, I can help with the scars. I just want to 
		consult the Avon handbook before doing 
		anything.
		
				PEG
		Kevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it 
		would make you feel if somebody were staring at 
		you.
		
				KEVIN
		I wouldn't care.
		
				PEG
		Well, I would, so don't do it!
		
				BILL
		This must be quite a change for you, Ed.
		
				PEG
		I think he prefers Edward.
		
				BILL
		Sure. So what have you been doing up there in 
		that big old place? I bet the view must be 
		spectacular, Ed.
		
				PEG
		I was just...
		
				BILL
		See all the way to the ocean?
		
				EDWARD
		Sometimes.
		
				PEG
		Bill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank 
		you.
		
				KEVIN
		Man, those things are cool. You know I bet 
		they're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's 
		neck...
		
				PEG
		Would you like some butter for your bread?
		
				PEG
		Great.
		
				EDWARD
		Thank you.
		
				KEVIN
		Can I bring him to show and tell on Monday?
		
				PEG
		I've had enough.
		
				PEG
			(to Edward)
		You think you can sleep? Things feel strange 
		now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good 
		night.
			(Peg tries to cover Edward's 
			scars.)
		
				PEG
		The light concealing cream goes on first, then 
		you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the 
		secret. More concealing for you? But you 
		complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of 
		lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close 
		enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I 
		have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and 
		start with a completely smooth surface. Don't 
		eat this stuff!  Sports announcements on

		Boy, it's just wonderful, Ed. My god, you, you 
		have the whole family in there, don't you?
		
				KEVIN
		Edward, come here.
			(Kevin cleans Edward's 
			scissorhands with water.)
		
				BILL
		No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, son. Go to 
		the garage and get the oil can. We don't want 
		him rusting up on this now, do we?
		
				PEG
		Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us.
		
				BILL
		Yes, it is.
		
				PEG
		Oh, Edward.
			(Esmeralda comes near.)
		
				ESMERALDA
		It's not heaven he's from. It's straight from 
		the stinking flames of hell. The power of satan 
		is in him. I can feel it. God, you have the 
		poor sheep strayed so far from the path.
		
				EDWARD
		We are not sheep.
		
				ESMERALDA
		Don't come near me.
		
				BILL
		That's right. Go on. Get out of here. Run!
		
				PEG
		Edward, don't you listen to her.
		
				BILL
		Don't worry about her, Edward. She's just an 
		old lonely loony. That's all.
			(Women knock on the door.)
		
				WOMEN
		Hi!
		
				JOYCE
		You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old 
		hermit crabs.
		
				PEG
		Hi, Joyce. Hi!
		
				JOYCE
		Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to 
		yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of 
		you.
		
				PEG
		No, it, it's... things have just been a little 
		hectic around here. That's all.
		
				JOYCE
		Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct 
		the situation. What time does the barbecue 
		begin?
		
				PEG
		Barbecue?
		
				JOYCE
		Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality 
		by introducing him to your friends, don't you?
		
				ANOTHER WOMAN
		I'll bring coleslaw.
		
				JOYCE
		And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time 
		was it that you said?
		
				PEG
		What time? Ah... bill.
		
				JOYCE
		About five?
		
				ESMERALDA
		He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's 
		not too late. You must push him from you. Expel 
		him. Trample down the perversion of nature.
		
				JOYCE
		Did you hear that? He's the perversion of 
		nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you 
		later. Bye bye.
		
				PEG
		I've always said that you really can't have a 
		picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs. 
		They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh, 
		dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know 
		you chopped all those things. What a really 
		big...
			(Peg notices a cut on his face.)
		Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no 
		need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda 
		won't be here and the rest of neighbors there 
		are really very nice. There's no need to be 
		nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You 
		just have to be yourself.
		
				EDWARD
		Myself?
		
				PEG
		That's right. Just your own sweet self.
		
				KEVIN
		Hey, play scissors, paper, stone with us.
		
				EDWARD
		Play scissors what?
		
				NEIGHBOR
		I got a doctor friend might be able to help 
		you. Aren't they most incredible?
		
				PEG
		He did them just like that.
		
				TINKA
		This afternoon?
		
				AT THE PARTY
		Hi, Mike. How are you doing? Hello, Jack. Hey, 
		kid. Hey, Hi. George Morroe! Whoa! That's a 
		heck of handshake. Uh, Harry! Harry! I saw you 
		on the golf course. You got a dozen of the 
		melons...
		
				PEG
			(to Edward)
		Are you ok?  Do you want something to eat?  Are 
		you hungry? Do you want a cracker?
		
				MARGIE
		He's so... different completely different, No 
		kidding mysterious.
		
				JOYCE
		Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold? 
		Just think what a single snip could do.
		
				HELEN
		Or undo.
		
				GEORGE
			(to Edward)
		Eddie.  The guys and I were talking, we'd like 
		want to invite you to our card game on Friday 
		night. Would you like that? Only thing is, you 
		can't cut.
		
				AN OLD MAN
		I have my own infirmity. Never did me a bit of 
		harm. Took some shrapnel during the war and 
		ever since then I can't feel a thing. Not a 
		damn thing. Listen Don't you ever let anybody 
		tell you you have a handicap.
		
				JOYCE
		Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be 
		ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're... 
		What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's 
		Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted 
		any of the ambrosia salad that I made 
		especially for you. Allow me. 
			(Joyce helps Edward to eat.)
		
				WOMAN 1
		You must try this.
			(Many women flock to him)
		
				MARGE
			(to Edward)
		You must try this.  It's my mother's recipe. 
		Let him chew, for heaven sakes with your green 
		thumb. I could use your help.
		
				HOUSEWIFE
		Me, too. There you go.
		
				WOMAN 2
		I want a row of angels.
		
				JOYCE
		Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my 
		house first.
		
				WOMAN 3
		One more.
		
				JOYCE
		Haven't you, Eddie?
		
				EDWARD
		I did?
		
				BILL
		Okay, everybody. Grab your plates. Soup's on.
		
				EDWARD
		I thought it was shish kebab.
		
				BILL
		What?
		
				EDWARD
		I thought it was shish kebab.
		
				BILL
		Yeah, it, it is shish kebab. It was a figure of 
		speech, Ed. You got to learn not to take things 
		so literally.
			(On hearing that, Edward looks 
			back the time the inventor taught 
			him the etiquette.)
		
				INVENTOR
		Let us pretend we're in the drawing room, and 
		the hostess is serving tea "Now, many numerous 
		little questions confront us" "Should the man 
		rise" "When he accepts his cup of tea?" "May 
		lump sugar be taken with the things?"
		
				EDWARD
		Hmm, no.
		
				INVENTOR
		Is it good form to accept a second cup? "Now, 
		should the napkin be entirely unfolded." Oh 
		should the center crease. Be allowed to remain? 
		It is so easy to commit embarrassing 
		blunders. "But etiquette humiliation and
		discomfort. Mmm yes, boring. Let us switch to, 
		Um... To some poetry, Hmm?" "There was an old 
		man from the cape." "Who made himself there, 
		but they keep such a beautiful shape." That's 
		right. Go ahead, smile. It's funny. That's 
		right.
		
				DENNY
		Okay, guys, we're home. shh.
		
				KIM
		I can't believe. Everything's still sopping.
		
				TEENAGE GIRL
		I can't wait to take a shower.
		
				SUZANNE
		And wash off the mildew.
		
				JIM
		If my parents set the alarm, I'm screwed I'll 
		sleep in the yard... again.
		
				KIM
		I told you to call to say we're coming back 
		early.
		
				DENNY
		Did you?
		
				SUZANNE
		He'd rather complain.
		
				JIM
		How else can I be the center of the attention? 
		You didn't call your parents.
		
				KIM
		They don't run their house like a police 
		station. Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny. See 
		you later.
		
				JIM
		See you later. Bye.
		
				KIM
		Don't forget your arm.
		
				JIM
		Oh, yeah.
		
				DENNY
		Come on, Jim let's go.
		
				KIM
		Bill! There's somebody in my room. Go. Look. A 
		murderer with an axe. He did try to even kill 
		me.
		
				BILL
		It's all right. It's all right. 
			( to Kevin)
		Go back to bed. It's only Edward.
			(to Edward)
		This way.
		
				PEG
		Honey, that was Edward.
		
				KIM
		Who is he? What are you talking about?
		
				PEG
		Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing 
		to be upset about. No, no. It's okay.
		
				BILL
		We'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up 
		with your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do 
		you like that? It's all made up and everything. 
		There you go. What's the matter? What's wrong? 
		She gets you nervous? You've been closed up in 
		a way in that castle too long.  You don't know 
		anything about the wonderful world of teen-age 
		girls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten 
		that out.
		
				EDWARD
		What is it?
		
				BILL
		Lemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a 
		certain age. They develop these gland things. 
		Their bodies swell up. They go crazy.
		
				EDWARD
		Glands?
		
				BILL
		yeah, glands. I try not to think about it
			(Edward drinks lemonade.)
		Good. Isn't it?
			(Peg calms down Kim.)
		
				PEG
		Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow 
		we'll fix your room right.
		
				KIM
		Mom, why did you have to bring him in here?
		
				PEG
		Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all 
		alone. You would have done the same thing.
		
				KIM
		Why does he have to stay here?
		
				PEG
		Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He 
		can't help the way he is. Have a little 
		sympathy.
		
				KIM
		I do have a little sympathy.
		
				PEG
		Then let's just say hello and later you can 
		come downstairs and shake his hand.
		
				KIM
		Shake his hand?
		
				PEG
		Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him 
		half to death.
		
				KIM
		I scared him to death?
		
				PEG
		Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a 
		proper introduction. Edward, this is our 
		daughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going 
		to live with us.
		
				KIM
		Hi! 
			(Edward falls on the floor.)
		
				JOYCE
			(to Edward)
		Eddie. Thirsty? 
			(to Kisses)
		Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear 
		myself think. Momma's precious little baby 
		girl.
			(to Edward)
		Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of 
		lemonade?
		
				EDWARD
		Lemonade?
			(Vomits)
			(Bell rings)
		
				KEVIN
		One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over. 
		They're the sharpest things in the world. They 
		can hack through anything. And...
		
				KIM
		I think they look weird. They give me the 
		creeps.
		
				A GIRL
		You should see the clown in front of Ms. 
		Peter's yard.
		
				EDWARD
		Kim!
		
				KIM
		Oh, no!
		
				A GIRL
		That's him?
		
				JIM
		He's calling you, Kim.
		
				KIM
		Stop it.
		
				A WOMAN
		Edward, you forgot your cookies.
		
				JIM
		Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you.
		
				A GIRL
		Let's go.
		
				PEG
		Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had 
		lunch at Jackie's today.
		
				BILL
		Really?
		
				PEG
		She's just had her kitchen completely redone.
		
				BILL
		I'll be darned.
		
				PEG
		New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new 
		microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher.
		
				BILL
		Yeah, isn't that wonderful?
		
				PEG
		Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me 
		your mom had her kitchen done too?
		
				JIM
		Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new 
		toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four 
		heads.
		
				PEG
		My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be 
		that rich.
		
				JIM
		No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My 
		father has his own room for his stuff to make 
		sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he 
		won't help me buy my own car.
		
				BILL
		Well, he probably wants you to pay for it 
		yourself. I agree with him. It builds 
		character. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking 
		of money, I understand you are not charging for 
		gardening, Edward?
		
				PEG
		Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.
		
				BILL
		Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of 
		life with cookies. You can't buy car with 
		cookies. Am I right, Jim?
		
				JIM
		Ah, that's true, sir. You can't.
			(Edward gives a piece of meat to 
			Kim's friend.)
		
				A GIRL
		I can't eat that. He used his hands. I don't 
		think it's sanitary.
			(Edward passes the piece to Kim 
			but drops it in her lap by 
			mistake.)
		
				EDWARD
		I'm sorry.
		
				PEG
		Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?
		
				KIM
		No, that's okay. I'll be right back. 
			(Edward begins styling women's 
			hair and becomes famous.)
		
				HOUSEWIFE
		This can't possibly be my Alexis.
			(to Edward)
		She looks so beautiful. Look at you. She's 
		gorgeous. Thank you.
		
				PEG
		It won't be long. She has just to decide on the 
		style, and then it will be fine. She just has 
		to decide what style she wants.
		
				JOYCE
		I was hoping for something big and bouffant. 
		Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses. 
		You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything 
		you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear. 
		Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair? 
		Would you cut mine? That was the single most 
		thrilling experience of my whole life.
		
				PEG
		We're getting the head of the company.
		
				KIM
		I'm home.
		
				PEG
		Hi, honey. We're in here.
		
				KIM
		Hi! What did you do to your hair?
		
				PEG
		Edward cut it. Isn't it wild? 
			(on telephone)
		Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you 
		in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's 
		right here. Great. So then you know all about 
		it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using. 
		Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to 
		the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a 
		little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative 
		suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much. 
		Bye bye.
			(to Edward)
		No wonder she's the head of the company. You 
		know, she started out as a sales representative 
		just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her 
		but until now I never had a reason. Thanks, 
		Edward.
		
				EDWARD
		She had some ideas?
		
				PEG
		You bet she did.
			(At the Airport)
		
				MARGIE
		I'll get that.
		
				MARGIE
		Edward! We're here. Come on. Let's get you 
		sharpened up.
		
				JIM
		You got it?
		
				KIM
		No, I can't believe this. 
			(Kim sees Edward coming.)
		Do you have a key?
		
				EDWARD
		No.
		
				KIM
		I could have sworn I put it in here somewhere.
		
				JIM
		Well, we're stranded. 
			(Edward opens the locked door with 
			his scissorhands.)
		
				KIM
		Wow! Thanks.
		
				JIM
		Ed, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break 
		it or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and 
		yell when Peg pulls in, huh?
		
				TV HOST
		Quite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward? 
		Yeah, get way over. Stand right up.
		
				WOMAN 1
		What's been the best part of your new life here 
		in town?
		
				EDWARD
		The friends I've made.
		
				TV HOST
		Any other questions?
		
				WOMAN 2
		Have you ever thought of having corrective 
		surgery or prosthetics? I know a doctor that 
		might be able to help you.
		
				EDWARD
		I'd like to meet him.
		
				TV HOST
		We'll give that name after the show. Thank you 
		very much. That's very nice. Anyone else? Yes, 
		stand right up.
		
				WOMAN 3
		But if you had regular hands you'd be like 
		everyone else.
		
				EDWARD
		Yes, I know.
		
				TV HOST
		I think he'd like that.
		
				WOMAN 4
		Then no one would think you're special. You 
		wouldn't be on TV or anything.
		
				PEG
		No matter what, Edward will always special.
		
				TV HOST
		More questions? Stand right up.
		
				WOMAN 5
		Your work is so interesting distinctive and 
		unique. Do you have plans to open your own 
		beauty salon?
		
				TV HOST
		There's an idea. Anyone else? Yeah.
		
				WOMAN 6
		Do you have a girl friend? Ahh.
			(Living room in Peg's)
		
				JIM
		Sure, he does. Right, Kim?
		
				KIM
		Now you got him started.
		
				JIM
		Knock it off, bubble- butt.
		
				KEVIN
		You did it.
		
				JIM
		So?
			(On the TV Show)
		
				TV HOST
		How about it? Is there some special lady in 
		your life?
		
				TV HOST
		Uh, everything's all right. He'll take a break 
		and we'll be right back after these messages.
		
				KIM
		Why are you laughing? He got hurt.
		
				JIM
		It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!
		
				KIM
		A little shock?
		
				JIM
		I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left 
		nut to see that again.
			(Edward in beauty salon)
		
				JOYCE
		Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so 
		thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's 
		just perfect. It's just what we've been looking 
		for. I want to call it "Shear Heaven." Here we 
		are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row 
		of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new 
		cosmetics.
			(TV 1/4)
		All along this row here.
		
				EDWARD
		Peg could sell cosmetics.
		
				JOYCE
		Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the 
		customers. Back in here is what I really want 
		to show you. This is the storeroom for 
		supplies. What I need from you today is to help 
		me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous. 
		You just sit down right there. I have some 
		smocks. Would you like me to model them? This 
		is my favorite because it's yellow. And what 
		it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that 
		fall down your neck. Then there's this old 
		purple one, you know, you kind of drape around 
		you like this.
		
				EDWARD
		I like that one.
		
				JOYCE
		You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting 
		for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward, 
		you come back here! You can't do that!
			(In the Restaurant)
		
				BILL
		Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the 
		dash board.
		
				PEG
		I've never seen that.
		
				EDWARD
		Sorry I'm late.
		
				PEG
		Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without 
		you. Here you go.
		
				BILL
		So, Edward, did you have a productive day?
		
				EDWARD
		Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going 
		to be. You could have a cosmetic counter.
		
				PEG
		Wouldn't that be great?
		
				BILL
		Great.
		
				EDWARD
		And then she showed me the back room where she 
		took all of her clothes off.
		
				BILL
		Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am.  
		I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty 
		parlor, that's what's going to teach you 
		volumes. There's nothing like running your own 
		business. I've never done it myself, but from 
		what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a 
		working man can have. So I guess the bank is 
		going to be your next step, huh?
		
				EDWARD
		The bank?
		
				BILL
		Yeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started. 
		Nothing to worry about. With your talent and 
		reputation, it's going to be a snap. Now.
		
				BANK CLERK
		No credit, no record of jobs you've held, no 
		savings, no personal investment, no social 
		security number. You may as well not even 
		exist. There is no collateral.
		
				PEG
		You know. We already have a second on the 
		house, but don't the testimonials make a 
		difference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife 
		can't wait to become a client?
		
				BANK CLERK
		We simply can't do it. Now get yourself a 
		social security card. Establish credit and buy 
		yourself a car. You have the side to advantage. 
		You can get one of those handicapped placards. 
		No problem. Park anywhere you like.
		
				PEG
		I can't believe it. Really, it's just an 
		outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of 
		it. We'll get your money somewhere.
		
				KIM
		But that's breaking and entering.
		
				JIM
		Look. My parents have insurance up the rear. 
		Okay? And all it will cost them is a little 
		hassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will 
		have new and better everything.
		
				KIM
		We can't.
		
				JIM
		Look. There's a guy who will give us cash for 
		the stuff.
		
				KIM
		Jim, I don't want to.
		
				JIM
		Well, do you want to ride around in a van like 
		Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever 
		we like? With a mattress in the back?
		
				KIM
		Why can't you just do it?
		
				JIM
		Because my father keeps the damn room locked, 
		and we need Edward to get us in.
		
				KIM
		Why can't you take the key like when he's 
		sleeping or something?
		
				JIM
		Look, you don't understand, everything he 
		handcuffs or ties will do anything for you.
		
				KIM
		What do you mean?  That's not true.
		
				JIM
		Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
		
				KIM
		That's not fair.
		
				JIM
		What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any 
		other way.
		
				KIM
		There got to be.
		
				JIM
		Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us 
		to have our own van?
		
				KIM
		Yeah.  Jim, the lights are on.
		
				JIM
		Those go on automatically. They've gone for the 
		weekend. I told you. That's right.
		
				DENNY
		This burglar scared.
		
				KIM
		You turned off the alarm. Am I right?
		
				JIM
		Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on.
		
				KIM
		I can't believe this is happening.
		
				A GIRL
		Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's 
		house?
		
				KIM
		He's never been here.
		
				EDWARD
		This person stole from you?
		
				JIM
		Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it. 
		Right? Come on. Let's go.
		
				EDWARD
		His parents will make him give it back.
		
				JIM
		Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's 
		parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim 
		you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come 
		on. Come on. Come on.
			(Edward picks the lock and the 
			door opens, but when he steps into 
			the room the alarm works and the 
			door shuts.)
		
				JIM
		The bastard had it wired separately. Come on.
		
				KIM
		No, Jim. We can't just leave him here.
		
				POLICEMAN
		We know you're in there.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		We're in the process of deactivating the system 
		so that you can come out.
		
				KIM
		Denny, turn around!
		
				JIM
		No way!
		
				KIM
		Jim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for 
		setting off your own alarm. We'll just tell 
		them we were breaking in.
		
				JIM
		I'm not going back there. Okay?
		
				KIM
		We have to go back.
		
				JIM
		No, because my father will prosecute.
		
				KIM
		His own son?
		
				JIM
		Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll 
		kill him.
		
				KIM
		Denny, turn around.
		
				JIM
		No.
		
				KIM
		Turn around. We have to.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Put your hands high in the air so we can see 
		them. Put your hands up!
		
				POLICEMAN
			(to Allen)
		He's got something in his hands. Looks like 
		knives.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon. 
		I'll ask you one more time and this is your 
		last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to 
		do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us 
		do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them. 
		Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to 
		fire. 
			(Neighbors gather and ask not to 
			fire.)
		
				A WOMAN
		Please. We know him.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Alright, cuff him.
			(At police station)
		
				PEG
		But can we see him now?
		
				POLICEMAN
		We'll have to hold him overnight for 
		observation.
		
				PEG
		He has to stay in prison all night?
		
				POLICEMAN
		Pick him up in the morning.
			(criminal investigation section in 
			police station)
		
				PEG
		Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself.
		
				BILL
			(to Edward)
		What in god's name was going through your mind, 
		son?
		
				PEG
		Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I 
		envied Jim's parents, their money.
		
				BILL
		What were you going to do with that stuff?
		
				PEG
		Oh, I blithely say, "We'll get money for the 
		salon somehow." But I never meant stealing. 
		Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's 
		not the way to get anything.
		
				BILL
		Except trouble. And you're in a heap of that.
		
				PEG
		Why ever did you do this?
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Will he be okay, Doc?
		
				PSYCHOLOGIST
		The years in spent isolation have not equipped 
		him with the tools necessary to judge right 
		from wrong. He's had no context. He's been 
		completely without guidance. Furthermore his 
		work, the garden sculptures, hair styles, and 
		so forth. Indicate that he's a highly 
		imaginative.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Character.
		
				PSYCHOLOGIST
		It seems clear that his awareness of what we 
		call reality is radically underdeveloped.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		But will he be all right out there?
		
				PSYCHOLOGIST
		Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
			(to Edward)
		Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying 
		about you. Watch yourself.
			(roadside)
		
				MARGIE
		I heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe.
		
				JOYCE
		All along I felt in my gut. There was something 
		wrong with him.
		
				MARGIE
		It could have been my house.
		
				HELEN
		It could have been any of our houses.
		
				ESMERALDA
		I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of satan 
		on him.  You didn't heed my warning. but now 
		you will because now you see it too.
			(Reporters approach Edward and 
			Peg.)
		
				PEG
		Edward. You stay here.
		
				REPORTER
		What do you say in your defense?
		
				EDWARD
		Nothing.
		
				PEG
		He didn't want to talk.
		
				REPORTER
		You have to say something.
		
				PEG
		He can't talk right now.
		
				REPORTER
		No comments? No remarks?
		
				REPORTER
			(to Edward)
		So were you set up? What was going through your 
		mind? One comment.
		
				PEG
		We have to get in the house. We don't want to 
		talk to you. We'll talk to you later.
		
				REPORTER
		One comment.
		
				PEG
		Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at 
		our Christmas party. Before I get you here for 
		your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this 
		year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well, 
		you may think that, but you're wrong.
		
				KIM
		You're here. They didn't hurt you, did they? 
		Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back, 
		but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you 
		for not telling them about me.
		
				EDWARD
		You are welcome.
		
				KIM
		It must have been awful when they told you 
		whose house it was.
		
				EDWARD
		I know it was Jim's house.
		
				KIM
		You did?
		
				EDWARD
		Yes.
		
				KIM
		Well, then why did you do it?
		
				EDWARD
		Because you asked me to.
			(Jim called out for Kim.)
		
				KIM
		Don't.
		
				JIM
		What's the matter with you? When you are going 
		to stop? I did what I could. My old man think 
		he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail. 
		What more do you want from me?
		
				KIM
		You could tell the truth.
		
				JIM
		So could do. You were there, too.
		
				KIM
		It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do 
		it.
		
				JIM
		But you did do it. I don't get why you give 
		such a shit anyway.
		
				BILL
		Well, we are going to try to help you find a 
		way to replace the drapes and the towels, but 
		our confidence in you, Edward, is not going to 
		be so easy to replace.
		
				KIM
		Dad!
		
				BILL
		Okay, a little ethics. You are walking down the 
		street. You find a suitcase full of money. 
		There's nobody around. No human person is in 
		evidence. What do you do? A
		You keep the money. B
		You use it to buy gifts for your friends and 
		your loved ones. C
		You give it to the poor. D
		You turn it into the police.
		
				KIM
		That is really stupid.
		
				PEG
		Kim!
		
				KEVIN
		I keep the money.
		
				PEG
		Simmer down.
		
				BILL
		Edward?
		
				KIM
		Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the 
		bowling alley? That will be fun.
		
				PEG
		You are not seeing Jim tonight?
		
				KIM
		No.
		
				KEVIN
		You know we had a cool show-and-tell today. 
		This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10. 
		maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all.
		
				PEG
		Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think 
		your father's finished yet.
		
				BILL
		Thank you, dear. Edward, we are waiting.
		
				EDWARD
		Give it to my loved ones?
		
				PEG
		Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you 
		should do, bit it's not.
		
				KEVIN
		You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give 
		it to the police.
		
				BILL
		Good thinking, Kevin.
		
				KIM
		Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's 
		the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.
		
				BILL
		We're trying to make things easier for him, so 
		let's cut the comedy for a little while.
		
				KIM
		I am being serious. It's a nicer thing to do.
		
				BILL
		We're not talking nice. We're talking right and 
		wrong.
		
				KIM
		Shut up.
		
				PEG
		Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't 
		learn right from wrong living in his family.
			(Margie and women on the phone.)
		
				WOMAN 1
		Did you hear what he did to Peg's curtains?
		
				MARGIE
		It is unbelievable that they're having their 
		Christmas party anyway. Are you going?
		
				WOMAN 1
		Oh, I don't think so.
		
				MARGIE
		He practically raped Joyce, you know 
		threatening her with those knives? It's a 
		miracle she escaped.
		
				HELEN
		I don't have anything against Bill and Peg, 
		but...
		
				JOYCE
		I know, I know. They've got that teenage 
		daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things 
		after what happened to me can you imagine?
		
				HELEN
		What do you say to Peg about the Christmas 
		party?
		
				MARGIE
		I said I hoped. We'd make it.
		
				HELEN
		I lied, too.
			(Peg's living room)
		
				PEG
		Edward, do you want to give me that new 
		haircut?
		
				EDWARD
		Again?
		
				PEG
		yes, sure.
		
				PEG
		It makes me proud to have you as my own 
		personal hairdresser.
		
				KEVIN
		Hi, honey. honey.
		
				EDWARD
		Kevin, you want to play scissors-paper-stone?
		
				KEVIN
		No.
		
				EDWARD
		No, why?
		
				KEVIN
		It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.
		
				PEG
		Other people's feelings?
		
				KEVIN
		I'll be outside.
		
				PEG
		A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you 
		cut away. Cut away. It needs something else. 
		What do you think, honey?
		
				KIM
		More bells?
		
				PEG
		More bells. Okay.
		
				KIM
		Mom, do you really think that we should be 
		having this party?
		
				PEG
		Of course I think we should be having this 
		party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we 
		need is just to calm things down and then 
		everything will just go back to normal. Do you 
		have any more bells, honey?
			(Kim goes out into the garden and 
			sees Edward sculpture an ice mass. 
			When he sculptures it, snowflakes 
			begin to fall, and Kim dances in 
			the snow. After he finishes it, he 
			cuts her hand by accident. Then Jim 
			shows up.)
		
				JIM
		Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out! Go. 
		Freak!
		
				BILL
		Edward, where are you going?
		
				KIM
		Where is he?
		
				JIM
		He tried to hurt you.
		
				KIM
		No, he did not and you know it.
		
				JIM
		Are you nuts? I just saw him.
		
				KIM
		Jim. I don't love you any more. I just want you 
		to go. Okay? Just go!
		
				JIM
		Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that? 
		He isn't even human.
		
				KIM
		Just get out of here. Okay? Just go! Dad, did 
		you see where Edward went?
		
				BILL
		Well. I don't know. He just walked down the 
		street.
		
				KIM
		Well, we have to go find him, mom?
		
				PEG
		You...your father will find him this minute.
		
				BILL
		All in the house. I'll take care of it. I'll go 
		find him.
		
				HELEN
		Edward! I'm calling the police!
		
				PEG
		All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little 
		cut.
			(doorbell chimes.)
		
				POLICE
		Hello, I'm here to see the man with the hands.
		
				PEG
		Oh... Uh...
		
				POLICE
		He's not here. Thank you.
		
				PEG
		Oh, dear.
		
				MARGIE
		Helen, did you actually see him?
		
				HELEN
		Yes, look.
		
				ESMERALDA
		You see, I told you he was a demon.
		
				MARGIE
		Oh, don't start that stuff again.
		
				POLICE
		I'm looking for the man with scissors.
		
				WOMEN
		He went that way. You have to do something 
		about that.
		
				POLICE
		All right, calm down, go on home. We'll handle. 
		Just go home.
		
				HELEN
		He's a de... a demon.
		
				WOMEN
		You've got to do something! All right, Let's 
		see. If he's at our house come on, oh...
		
				PEG
		I'm sure your father will find him soon.
		
				KIM
		What time is it?
		
				PEG
		It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?
		
				KIM
		Where are they? God. I hope he's okay!
		
				PEG
		So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward 
		down here to live with us, I really didn't 
		think things through. And I didn't think about 
		what could happen to him, or to us, or to the 
		neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it 
		might be best if he goes back up there. Because 
		at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back 
		to normal.
		
				BILL
		Now I got up by the Wiggmans, but I didn't see 
		him anywhere.
		
				PEG
		Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the 
		car and go look for him.
		
				BILL
		Where's Kevin now?
		
				PEG
		He's Max'es.
		
				BILL
		Where do you think you're going, young lady?
		
				KIM
		With you guys.
		
				BILL
		No, you're staying here in case somebody shows 
		up!
		
				PEG
		We'll be right back, dear.
		
				EDWARD
		Police!
			(On seeing a police car Edward 
			goes back to Peg's)
		
				KIM
		Edward?
		
				EDWARD
		Are you okay?
		
				KIM
		Yes, are you okay?
		
				EDWARD
		Where's everybody?
		
				KIM
		Out looking for you. Hold me.
		
				EDWARD
		I can't.
			(Kim holds Edward and Edward 
			reflects about the inventor.)
		
				INVENTOR
		I know it's a little early for Christmas, 
		Edward, but I have a present for you.
			(Kevin comes out of his friend's 
			house.)
			(Jim talks with his friend.)
		
				JIM
		Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he 
		could do other places.
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Yeah, that's sick. I feel like I'm coming to 
		pass out, or puke or something.
		
				JIM
		Later, first take me to her house.
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Come on, don't make me drive.
		
				JIM
		Just do it!
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Jesus, maybe she was right about you.
		
				JIM
		Just drive.
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Relax.
		
				KEVIN
		See you tomorrow. Call me, Right?
		
				A MAN
		Have they caught him yet?
		
				KEVIN
		Who?
		
				A MAN
		Him, that cripple. Let me know when they do. 
		Let us all you know, okay? Like a good boy.
			(The car driven by Denny comes 
			close to run over Kevin. Edward who 
			sees it saves Kevin but many people 
			mistakenly think that Edward tries 
			to kill Kevin. Kim tells Edward to 
			run, and he runs away. People 
			follow him to the castle.)
		
				EDWARD
		Oh! Are you ok? oh! owh!
		
				KEVIN
		Help! Edward help!
		
				EDWARD
		I'm your friend.
		
				KEVIN
		Stop! Don't! Stop! Get away, now! Somebody help 
		us! Help!
		
				PEOPLE 1
		What are you doing? Get away! 
		
				PEOPLE 2
		Get the police!
		
				PEOPLE 3
		Somebody call the police! Hey
		
				KIM
		Let go of me! Why? Kevin!
		
				PEG AND BILL
		Kevin! Kevin! Edward! Get away. What happened? 
		Edward! Go home! Go home!
		
				PEOPLE
		Somebody call the police! Aah! 
		
				KIM
		Jim, stop it. Get off him!
			(Siren)
		
				KIM
		Run.
		
				PEG
		Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest 
		scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all 
		right? Let just leave him alone!
			(Gunshots)
		
				POLICE
		Go on, run.
		
				PEOPLE
		What happened? Did you get him? Ok, Is he dead?
		
				POLICE
		It's all over, go on home. There's nothing more 
		to see. What happened out there? It's all over!
		
				PEOPLE
		I want some answers. Where is he?
		
				PEOPLE
		Get back here! I want to ask you something. Do 
		you see him? Wait! I want to ask you... He's in 
		that car. Look at that.
		
				JOYCE
		I don't believe it. They don't have him. I'm 
		going! No! That's not a good idea!
		
				EDWARD
		They are coming? Did I hurt Kevin?
		
				KIM
		No, he's okay. He said he was just scared. 
		Edward, I was so afraid. I thought you were 
		dead.
		
				JIM
		I didn't.
			(Jim fires at Edward and Kim tries 
			to stop him. In their fight, Edward 
			kills Jim, and then says good-by to 
			Kim.)
		
				KIM
		Jim. Stop! Stop it, or I'll kill you myself.
		
				JIM
		Hey! I said stay away from her!
			(Neighbor's voice)
		
				EDWARD
		Goodbye!
		
				KIM
		I love you.
		
				A MAN
		Is he in there?
		
				KIM
		He's dead. The roof caved in on him. They 
		killed each other. You can see for yourselves. 
			(She raises a pair of scissors.)
		
				OLD KIM
		She never saw him again. Not after that night.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		How do you know?
		
				OLD KIM
		Because I was there.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		You could have gone up there. You still could 
		go.
		
				OLD KIM
		No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would 
		rather want him remember me the way as I was.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		How do you know he's still alive.
		
				OLD KIM
		I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he 
		is. You see, before he came down here, it never 
		snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up 
		there now, I don't think it would be snowing. 
		Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.
Erik the Viking
 

 
  


 

 


 ERIK THE VIKING - Terry Jones --------------- Blackness. Flames begin to lick upwards from the bottom of the screen. Suddenly all hell breaks loose. Screaming, yelling. Black figures flash across the foreground, with the flames still burning behind. There follows a confusion of burning, raping, killing and looting - we don't clearly see what's going on. Suddenly we cut to the interior of a hut. The door is in the process of being broken down. The camera pans onto the close-up face of an attractive girl who is staring in horrified fascination at the door. Her arms are white with fresh dough and flour. Suddenly the door bursts open and a wild-looking Viking leaps into the hut. He holds a sword. He looks around wildly and then his eyes come to rest on the girl. This Viking, I'm afraid, is Erik. We are about to see him in the worst possible light so be prepared. The girl, whose name is Helga, cowers, and looks terrified but resolute. Erik glances round. Then slowly he advances on the girl, forcing her back onto a chest. Erik holds his sword to Helga's throat with his right hand, while his left hand searches to find the thongs holding up his trousers. He is clearly having difficulties trying to hold his heavy sword to Helga's throat at he same time as undoing his trousers. He fumbles and lowers his sword for a moment. HELGA Have you done this sort of thing before? ERIK Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast. HELGA (looking sceptical) Looting and pillaging, eh? ERIK (on the defensive) Yes. HELGA What about the raping? ERIK Shut up. HELGA It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life. ERIK Sh! He covers her mouth with his free hand, and looks round to make sure no one's heard. Then he carries on trying to undo his trousers, but he is now somewhat more than half-hearted about it. Helga watches suspiciously. HELGA Do you LIKE women? Erik is clearly shocked and stung by the insinuation. He stops. ERIK Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em. HELGA (pointing out the obvious) You don't love ME. ERIK No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people... HELGA What - rape? ERIK No. It isn't rape then, is it? HELGA Oh, get it over with. ERIK (hesitates again) I don't suppose... no... HELGA What? ERIK I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all? HELGA What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me... This is too much for Erik. We withers under the irony. ERIK I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone. HELGA (puzzled) About raping me? ERIK About NOT raping you... HELGA You DON'T like it, do you? ERIK Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all. HELGA What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it? ERIK Oh well - you've GOT to do them. HELGA Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting? ERIK To pay for the next expedition, of course. HELGA But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out. ERIK Oh! Stop talking as if we were married! HELGA Well you started it. ERIK I just said I didn't feel like raping you. HELGA And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on. Erik vents of his frustration on the already shattered door. ERIK Scream. HELGA Ah. ERIK Louder. HELGA Aaagh! Rape! ERIK (he'd forgotten about that) Oh, thanks Two more Vikings burst in with eyes blazing. They have the very unfortunate names of Ernest and Jennifer, but it doesn't really matter, for reasons which will become obvious very quickly. They are also slightly drunk. ERNEST Rape? JENNIFER Where? Jennifer the Viking sways and leans against a door post. The marauder's eyes come to rest on Erik and Helga who are standing, fully clothed, about six feet apart. They look slightly puzzled. HELGA He raped me standing up. There is a pause. Erik looks up at Helga. Why has she saved his face by telling this lie? Jennifer the Viking turns to Erik. JENNIFER You finished, then? ERIK Oh... yes... I suppose so... ERNEST Right! Me first! JENNIFER No! I asked! Ernest leaps on top of Helga and pins her to the ground. Jennifer joins in. Erik looks stunned for a moment. Then he suddenly leaps to Helga's defence. ERIK Leave her alone! He pulls Jennifer off, but Jennifer fights back. Erik forces Jennifer back until he falls into the kneading trough. They fight in the dough for some moments, until Erik runs Jennifer through. The dough is stained red, and the film is rid of such an inappropriately named Viking once and for all. Erik then turns his attention on Ernest who is still on top of Helga. Without a moment's hesitation, Erik runs him through the back. Ernest screams. So does Helga. Erik turns white, and pulls out his sword. Ernest falls over into a heap with his co-misnomer, and Erik kneels beside Helga to find a bloodstain under her breast where he has inadvertently run her through. She is clearly not long for this world. HELGA Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death. ERIK I didn't mean to! HELGA (gasping for breath) Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts... Erik cradles her head and tries helplessly to staunch the blood. ERIK You told them I raped you - why? HELGA (dying) I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable... ERIK Why should you care? HELGA (dying) Why... should YOU care? ERIK Tell me your name? Helga looks up at him, but dies in his arms, without ever saying her name. ERIK Tell me... what IS it...? Erik realizes she has gone. He gazes at her for some time. He looks around at the two dead bodies beside them. Then he listens to the sound of raping and slaughter continuing on the outside. Screams and bloodthirsty shuts echo alongside the roar of flames and the cries of animals. The camera tracks into a big close-up on Erik. Superimpose the title: ERIK THE VIKING: Second title: TIM ROBBINS. Mix through to wide shot of the burning village. Figures running here and there. Superimpose the rest of the opening titles. By the last of the opening titles the last of the flames are dying down. Cut to a close-up of a very loud-looking Viking screaming into the camera, as he hurls an axe. This Viking's name is Thorfinn Skull- Splitter. The axe thuds into the wall a few inches away from the face of a frightened girl, Unn, who is pinned to the wall with her braids spread out. The Vikings are hurling axes at her a la Kirk Douglas in THE VIKINGS. Several Vikings sitting at ale-bench, laugh in a rather unpleasant way. Erik, however, frowns. He is sitting at a table on a dais, next to his grandfather, the chief of the village. His grandfather almost chokes with merriment. Erik's mother glances at him with some hostility. Meanwhile the drunken Thorfinn has just lifted the totally legless Ivar the Boneless up off the floor and presses an axe into his hand. A tremor of nervousness ripples round the females in the Mead Hall. Ivar is clearly in no condition to throw anything, except, perhaps, the contents of his stomach. Unn winces. Finally, amidst much giggling, Ivar throws wildly, and the axe smashes into a jug being carried by one of the serving girls. The menfolk erupt into drunken hysterics at this. The women clearly feel that the occasion is getting out of hand. But before any of them can work up enough courage to intervene, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter has thrust an axe into the hands of the even more plastered Sven the Berserk. Now Sven is not the Viking to let a little matter like not being able to see straight stop him heaving the axe at a young maiden. He takes the axe and whirls it wildly over his head. Even the other drunken Vikings realize this could be dangerous, and they cower behind the table. Sven lets go of the axe. Unn shuts her eyes prepared for the worst. There is a dull thud and a grunt and then a whoop of mirth. Unn opens her eyes to find that the axe has come to rest in the back of a totally stupefied Viking who merely slumps forward onto the table he is sitting at. On the opposite side sits Harald Missionary, a rather seedy cleric who has long since given up trying to convert the pagans and found solace in their mead. He thinks about intervening, but decides that it's a bit late really and that he might as well finish off his ale-cup instead. GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE (his only admirer) refills it for him. At this moment, however, the axe-throwers have run out of axes, so, as they go to retrieve the ones they've thrown, Harald Missionary salves his conscience by lurching across to the unfortunate Unn. He pokes his dog-eared bible under her nose. HARALD If you were thinking of converting, my dear, this would be an IDEAL opportunity... UNN Not now! HARALD (who is used to rebuffs) No, of course not... (he hesitates) You might not get another chance, you know... UNN Go away. At this moment another axe thuds into the wall, speeding up Harald's desire to get back to the ale-bench. HARALD Yes, of course... I'll pray for you anyway, my dear... Suddenly an axe shatters a large earthware vessel. HARALD Yes.. That's what I'll do... Harald scuttles back to the ale-bench as fast as he can. Erik meanwhile, stares in astonishment as, for a fleeting moment, he sees Helga, the girl he accidentally killed, standing there with her braids spread out in place of Unn. He shakes his head and the vision passes. In the meantime, however, Ivar's mum (perhaps the toughest lady in the village) has decided that enough is enough. IVAR'S MUM Let her go! THORFINN Why? VIKINGS Yes, why? SVEN THE BERSERK Why should we let er go? THORFINN We haven't hit a single braid yet! The Vikings all guffaw. Ivar's mum has had enough. She throws the contents of a jug of ale over Thorfinn. He is shocked, but after the first shock he grins evilly, because now he's been given carte blanche to do the thing he enjoys doing most. Without another thought he throws a vicious right hook at Ivar's mum and lays her out cold. Erik reacts with disgust. His grandad, however, gives a whoop of glee. GRANDAD Whoah! Heee! That showed her! Meanwhile a little shrivelled old man is jumping up and down. INGEMUND THE OLD Hey! He hit my wife! Ingemund starts to go for Thorfinn, but Thorhild beats him to it. She grabs one of the long-handled cooking griddles from the fires and swings it at Thorfinn. Thorfinn, however, ducks, and the red-hot griddle hits Sven the Berserk, who is standing with his back to Thorfinn. Sven screams and goes berserk, turning round and hitting Thorfinn who is now standing upright again. INGEMUND THE OLD Leave him alone. Ingemund hits Sven. Thangbrand hits Ingemund and a general fight breaks out. Erik's grandad clearly considers this the highlights of the evening, but Erik looks at it in disgust and at his grandad in despair. Eventually he gets up and walk out of the Mead Hall. His grandad notices and frowns. He knows something's wrong with his grandson but hasn't a clue what it could be. Erik's mother frowns and nods to his grandad. Grandad gets up and fights his way through the melee to follow Erik out of the Hall. The snow lies thick over the village as Erik's grandfather joins his grandson beside the little quay. Erik is staring broodily into the night. GRANDFATHER What's the matter, son? Erik doesn't reply. His grandfather glances back at the Mead Hall, whence the sound of the fight drift across the snow. GRANDFATHER We're missing all the fun... ERIK What's it all about? GRANDFATHER What? ERIK We toil and labour, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet... GRANDFATHER You talking piffle, son? ERIK Where does it all get us, Grandpa? GRANDFATHER Who have you been talking to? ERIK I met this girl... GRANDFATHER It's always the women that start the trouble. ERIK She got me thinking... GRANDFATHER So? What'd you do to her? Erik stops in his tracks - as if brought up short by the horror of what he has done. ERIK I... I... KILLED her... GRANDFATHER That's my boy! Erik's grandfather gives him a paternal hug. Erik looks at him and thinks about the generation gap. Cut to feet running in the snow. It is day. ERIK Freya! Erik looks around him and calls out again. ERIK Freya! Erik runs into the distance - a small figure against the dramatic wintry landscape. Cut to a remote, barren mountainside. Erik climbs up into shot, and continues climbing until he reaches a cave. He enters it. As his eyes get used to the dark he can make out a few signs of life: a cooking pot on a fire, a straw bed, a pile of rune-sticks. ERIK Freya? Freya? There is a bundle of rags behind Erik. A head rises from it. This is Freya. FREYA Ah... Erik... Erik the "Viking"... It is not clear whether her words are not a little mocking. FREYA Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"? ERIK I shouldn't have come. FREYA They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories? Erik doesn't reply. Freya watches him craftily. FREYA Young men are only interested in fighting and killing. Erik looks up at her sharply. It is as if she has read his mind. ERIK But has it always been like that, Freya? From the beginning of time? Freya doesn't reply. Instead she walks to the mouth of the cave. Erik follows her. They look out at the grey, desolate landscape. Nothing but arctic wastes, snow and desolation. Above them the black clouds boil ceaselessly. FREYA What do you see, Erik? ERIK I see the world. FREYA I it night or day, Erik? ERIK It is day, of course, Freya. FREYA Is it summer or winter, Erik? Erik looks round at the snowy wastes and ten back at Freya, puzzled. ERIK The winter is past, thank goodness, Freya. It is summer. Freya puts her face close to Erik's and peers into his eyes. FREYA Have you ever seen the sun, Erik? ERIK The sun is up beyond the clouds - where it always is. FREYA But have you ever seen it? Think back... ERIK Of course not... but... when I was a child.... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue... FREYA The sky WAS blue, Erik... once. Erik looks at her. FREYA The Old Stories tell of an age that would come such as this - when Fenrir the Wolf would swallow the sun, and a Great Winter would settle upon the world. It was to be an axe age, a sword age, a storm age, when brother would turn against brother, and men would fight each other until the world would finally be destroyed. Erik looks out across the bleak and gloomy landscape and the black, boiling clouds in the sky. ERIK (almost to himself) Then... this is the Age of Ragnarok? Freya turns to go back into the cave. ERIK Wait, Freya! Erik re-enters the cave. ERIK Is there nothing men can do? FREYA The Gods are asleep, Erik. ERIK I will go and wake them up! Freya turns and looks at him. She clearly enjoys his earnest enthusiasm, but is afraid he doesn't know what he is talking about. ERIK Tell me what I must do, Freya! Freya thinks for some moments. The she speaks. FREYA Erik... Far out in the midst of the Western Ocean there is a land... men call it Hy-Brasil. There you will find a horn that is called Resounding. You must take the Horn Resounding, and three times you must blow it. The first note will take you to Asgaard. The second will awaken the Gods, and the third note will bring you home. But remember... once you are in the spell of the Horn, hatred will destroy you. Erik turns to go and then hesitates. ERIK And will the dead ever return, Freya? FREYA That I cannot tell you. Cut to a big close-up of a head being banged on the ground. It is Thorfinn Skull-Splitter's. The person doing the banging is an enraged Sven the Berserk. Suddenly Erik pushes his way through the crowd and separates them. There is general disgruntlement all round, and murmurs of: "Who does he think he is?" ERIK'S GRANDAD What are you doing, Erik? Thorfinn just said SVEN'S GRANDFATHER died of old age. INGEMUND THE OLD They must fight to the death. THORFINN SKULL-SPLITTER That's right! Sven must kill me. OTHERS Yes. Stay out of this. What's it to do with you? (etc) Sven grids his teeth and struggles to get at Thorfinn, but Erik still keeps them apart. ERIK Aren't you afraid of death, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter? Thorfinn shrugs. THORFINN Not death by the sword! It means I shall drink in Valhalla with the great warriors. Cut away To Harald Missionary engaged in his usual business of chatting up any available female. HARALD MISSIONARY You don't still believe in all that Valhalla stuff, do you? THORHILD THE FEMALE Go away. HARALD Fine... right... just checking. He moves off. ERIK And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard? SVEN I will join my grandfather there. THORFINN He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age! SVEN You liar! They start trying to kill each other again, and crash through a fence into the pig-sty. Pigs squeal and run in all directions. ERIK Stop it! OTHERS Leave them alone! Keep out of it, Erik! The others pull Erik away. GRANDAD There's only one way to settle it. EVERYONE Yes! THORFINN He MUST kill me! EVERYONE Yes! That's right! (etc) Sven struggles again to oblige, and they both topple into the duck pond. Erik dives back to keep them apart. ERIK There is another way. GRANDAD Who gets killed? ERIK Nobody gets killed. THORFINN Oh, well... He starts attacking Sven again. Erik decides there is only one way to make his point. He lets fly with his fists and lays both the antagonists out for a moment. ERIK But it will be dangerous. Maybe none of us will return. SNORRI THE MISERABLE Ah well, that's much more sensible than just Thorfinn getting killed. Shall we all go and pack now? SVEN What are you talking about, Erik? ERIK What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge? This causes a sensation amongst everyone watching, on the lines of "You can't do that" and so on. They scoff at Erik. THORFINN (in disbelief) FIND the Rainbow Bridge? ERIK Find it... AND cross it! Super-sensation amongst everyone - except for Harald Missionary who shakes his head sadly. HARALD Look! You can't find somewhere that doesn't exist. GRANDAD (to Harald) Shut up! Harald shrugs. SVEN Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik. ERIK What's the matter? Are you afraid to try? Thorfinn and Sven are put on the defensive. THORFINN Of course we're not afraid to try, but... Erik rounds on Thorfinn, sensing he had the advantage. ERIK "But" what? THORFINN But... ERIK What? Thorfinn's mental powers find it hard to articulate any proposition on such a vast metaphysical concept. Sven comes to his rescue. SVEN Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard. ERIK We'd be the first! SNORRI You mean we'd be dead? ERIK No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods. Pause. Uncomfortable shifting. SVEN But HOW? ERIK I don't know - but I'm not afraid to try. THORFINN Well I'M certainly not, either. SVEN Neither am I. ERIK Then you'll come. HARALD But there isn't such a place as... Look... THORFINN & SVEN Shut up! ERIK What d'you say? SVEN Well... I'm game. THORFINN Me too. Erik grins. He has persuaded them against their will. GRANDAD Aren't you going to go on fighting? SVEN & THORFINN No. OTHERS Oh... There is general disappointment all around. IVAR THE BONELESS Oh, go on... GRANDAD Just have a bit of a fight. INGEMUND THE OLD I'LL fight someone. GRANDAD You're too old. INGEMUND THE OLD No, I ain't. Cut to an adze striking timber. The Viking's ship, GOLDEN DRAGON, is being repaired and fitted out for a JOURNEY. Erik is there, directing operations. The camera tracks through all the activity and finally comes to rest on Keitel Blacksmith. He is a magnificent mountain of a man in an Arnold Schwarzeneggarish sort of way. He hammers a sword, and sparks fly, but his eyes keep returning to the preparations for the voyage. Clearly something is worrying him. His assistant, Loki, sidles up to him. LOKI Wish you were going too? Keitel grunts angrily and plunges the sword into cold water. Steam and bubbles. LOKI But you CAN'T because you're too busy. Keitel pulls the sword out of the water and tests it. It slices like as razor, Loki watches. LOKI Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one. KEITEL Yes, it is good. But I told him ten. LOKI You could charge him what you like. Loki takes the sword from Keitel and stacks it alongside a lot more freshly made swords. LOKI You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it. KEITEL (shocked) Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says... LOKI Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"... Keitel goes back to his forge and pulls out a fresh dollop of white-hot ore. Loki comes up behind him. LOKI If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us. KEITEL (banging with his hammer) Can't make enough swords! Bang! Bang! Bang! KEITEL Can't make enough axe-heads! Bang! Bang! Bang! LOKI But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods.. Keitel stops smiting the metal on his forge. He stares into space. KEITEL They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky... LOKI The Age of Ragnarok ends... KEITEL The bottom falls out of the sword business! LOKI It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths. KEITEL (this touches a nerve in his muscular mind) My brother blacksmiths! LOKI That's right. KEITEL The Blacksmith's Code says I must... LOKI Honour and protect all blacksmiths. KEITEL (as if reciting his oath) Together we stand! LOKI You can't let Erik do THAT. Loki smiles. He has Keitel playing into his hands, although Keitel doesn't realize it. Fade. Cut to some days later. The expedition is set to leave. Thorfinn Skull-Splitter taking leave of his mum and dad. THORFINN'S MUM And you've got BOTH axes? THORFINN Yes, Mother. THORFINN'S MUM And something to sharpen them with? THORFINN Yes, Mum. THORFINN'S MUM And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you. THORFINN No, Mother. THORFINN'S MUM And keep your sword greased. THORFINN Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad. THORFINN'S DAD And don't forget to was - you know - ALL over. THORFINN No, Dad. THORFINN'S MUM And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it. THORFINN (mildly) I never do... Cut to Sven the Berserk who is also being lectured. The lecture is coming from his father - Ulf the Maddeningly Calm. SVEN'S FATHER (sotto voce) It's a tradition. SVEN I know, Dad. SVEN'S FATHER I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair... SVEN You went berserk... SVEN'S FATHER I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald... SVEN So did your father... SVEN'S FATHER So did my father and his father before him. SVEN But it's a responsibility... SVEN'S FATHER But it's a responsibility being a Berserk. SVEN I must only let the red rage... SVEN'S FATHER You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle. SVEN (losing his temper) I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL I THOUSAND TIMES! A sudden silence falls, as all the village turns to stare nervously at Sven. He goes berserk and demolishes a nearby hut with his head. Ulf the Maddeningly Calm shakes his head. SVEN'S FATHER No no... you'll never make a Berserk. If you let it out now you'll have nothing left for battle... IVAR'S MUM Besides... it's dangerous. SVEN'S FATHER (gloomily) It's the end of a family tradition. In another corner of the village Leif the Lucky is standing with his pregnant girlfriend. GIRL Bye, Leif. LEIF Bye... sorry... GIRL Yeah... well... LEIF You will wait? GIRL What d'you expect me to do? She takes a bracelet off her arm and gives it to Leif. GIRL Wear this for luck. Leif looks at it. LEIF That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky. GIRL Please. Cut to Harald Missionary dumping a bag on board the ship. GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE is helping him. Snorri looks at him in surprise. SNORRI YOU coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard. HARALD I thought I might do a bit of business on the way. SNORRI You're wasting your time. HARALD Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert... SNORRI There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER. HARALD Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian. SNORRI Same thing, isn't it? HARALD No, it is NOT. Meanwhile in another part of the village, Loki is strapping a large consignment of swords onto a pony. He glances round and then sneaks surreptiously out of the village, over the barren hills of Norway, under the boiling black skies of Ragnarok. Back at the quayside, GOLDEN DRAGON is ready for the journey. Erik addresses the villagers. ERIK Well... we'll be off now... Erik's grandad waits for some time before he realizes that Erik isn't intending to say anything else. GRANDAD You need to say a bit more than that! ERIK Oh... er... yes... The faces of the village-folk turn towards him. There are many moist eyes. Erik's mother starts to cry. ERIK Oh, there, Mum... (he turns and addresses everyone) Don't be sad.... You all know why we're going, so don't grieve. Maybe untold dangers do lie ahead of us, and some of you may well be looking at the one you love for the last time... Someone bursts out sobbing. Erik desperately tries to rally their spirits. ERIK But don't grieve! Even tough the Hordes of Muspel tear us limb from limb... or the Fire Giants burn each and every one of us to a cinder... More crying. ERIK ...though we may be swallowed by the Dragon of the North Sea or fall off the Edge of the World... don't cry. More crying. ERIK No! Don't cry.... By this time most of the village is blubbering profusely. Cut to Harald Missionary. He has his arm round his weeping girlfriend. HARALD MISSIONARY Sh... There... it's all fantasy, there's no Dragon of the North Sea, no Edge of the World... GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE That's what YOU say. ERIK (aside to his Grandad) What's the matter with them? GRANDAD Just say something cheerful. ERIK Oh... right! (He can't think of anything) Well.... CHEERS everybody! Erik smiles broadly and waves. The entire village stares back at him with tears in their eyes, and biting their lips. Suddenly one mother can't hold it back any more. THORFINN'S MUM Don't go! Another mother rushes out and grabs Ivar the Boneless. IVAR'S MUM My son! I don't want you to go! IVAR I don't want to go, either... ERIK Oh gods! Please, everybody! Keep calm! It's not certain ALL of us are going to die... and in any case we may not die HIDEOUS deaths... More renewed sobbing. Grandad's eyes go heavenwards. GRANDAD (to Erik) I think we should go... ERIK Right. (he turns for a last salute) Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent... GRANDAD No, don't say anything else! Suddenly Keitel Blacksmith steps forward. His muscles ripple. His handsome face radiates heroism and manliness. KEITEL Wait, Erik! ERIK Keitel Blacksmith? They stop and turn. KEITEL You can't go without me. Who will repair your swords and mend your shields? Renewed sobs from the women. WOMEN Oh, no! Ah, lackaday! Not HIM too! ERIK What's the matter now? UNN If Keitel Blacksmith goes with you... THORHILD We'll have no one to do the things he did for us. THORKATLA THE INDISCRETE OR sharpen our knives and make our pans. An awkward silence. The others all turn on her and frown - a bit of shin-kicking goes on. It's clear that Keitel is popular amongst the womenfolk. Erik doesn't notice. ERIK You will have Keitel's assistant, Loki, to do all that. WOMEN Loki? Eurrgh! ERIK What's wrong with Loki? He's become very good at blacksmithing. WOMEN Yes... but... THORKATLA He's so small and... The others all shush her up. More shin-kicking. THORHILD (innocently) Oh, yes... we've got Loki... That's true... Cut to Loki leading his pony across a bleak landscape. He eventually stops and looks ahead. There stands a gibbet with two corpses dangling from it. He is nearing his destination. Cut back to Erik and his men getting into GOLDEN DRAGON. Erik notices Thorfinn and Sven quarrelling over Leif the Lucky. ERIK Hey, you two! What's going on? SVEN I was sitting there. LEIF No, you weren't. THORFINN Leif's sitting here. I need a bit of luck. LEIF See. SVEN Look, I bagged it last week. ERIK It doesn't matter WHERE you sit! SVEN Yes it does! We could be at sea for months. ERIK Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING? SVEN I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time. Sven nods towards Snorri the Miserable - an Eeyore of a Viking if ever there were one. SNORRI Thank you VERY much indeed. ERIK Now stop it! SNORRI It's SO nice to feel wanted. ERIK Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there... SNORRI Trust me to get the missionary. Suddenly Erik notices Sven's father climbing aboard. ERIK What are YOU doing here? SVEN'S DAD You may need a real Berserk. SVEN I AM one, Dad! ERIK We haven't got a spare place. IVAR He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway. ERIK Well, you ARE! KEITEL Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place. ERIK What's the matter with Bjorn? THORFINN Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night. ERIK HE was lucky... (to Sven's dad) Sit there. SNORRI You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time. ERIK That's true. (to Sven) YOU'D better sit there. (to Sven's dad) You there, and Ornulf there. SNORRI Now you've got all the big ones on one side. Erik looks around. It is true that all the tall burly ones are on one side. ERIK All right, you go there. You here... Sven's dad and Ornulf swap places. SVEN'S DAD Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif. ERIK Shut up. You there. You there and you there. Ivar and Ornulf swap places. Erik surveys this re-arrangement. ERIK That's better. SNORRI Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other. This is true. Erik thinks some moments and then: ERIK It doesn't matter. They start to haul the sail up. Ropes are released. The boat rocks. Suddenly a voice cuts through the crowd. It is Erik's mother. ERIK'S MUM Wait! Wait! Wait! ERIK What is it? (he is clearly a little embarrassed) ERIK'S MUM Here, son. She tries to hand Erik what looks unmistakably like a pillow. Erik is dumbfounded. ERIK'S MUM Your father always made sure he could rest his head at night. Erik is mortified. The others snigger, though not without some sympathy for Erik. They've ALL been embarrassed by their mums at one time or another. ERIK I can't take THAT on a voyage! ERIK'S MUM It was your father's! Erik will find it hard to refuse now. But he hesitates. ERIK'S MUM It was the pillow HE took with him. He said it once saved his life. Erik reluctantly takes the precious object. His mother kisses him. Everyone has fallen silent now. The relatives stand helpless on the shore as GOLDEN DRAGON starts to drift away from them. The Vikings sit in their places, hands on the oars looking back at their loved ones. Erik stands at the prow of GOLDEN DRAGON. For a moment he thinks he sees the girl he killed, standing, white in death, the spear-wound still fresh. Erik raises his hand in a half-goodbye. We cut back to the loved ones, now the girl is no longer there. They too half-raise their hands. Erik suddenly turns and gives a shout: ERIK Huuup! The oars go up and then into the water, and GOLDEN DRAGON commences her voyage. Cut back to GOLDEN DRAGON at sea. Snorri is feeling queasy and gazing gloomily at the receding coastline of Norway. Thangbrand is sitting near him and feeling equally queasy. SNORRI Have a good look... that's the last we'll see of old Norway. Snorri is desperately trying to control his insides. SNORRI Goodbye home... goodbye family... goodbye loved ones... (he starts to throw up) Goodbye lunch... THANGBRAND Oh! Shut up. Harald Missionary puts his arm around Snorri. HARALD You know, my son, our lord said... SNORRI YOUR lord. HARALD Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick." SNORRI I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord. Harald Missionary gives him a condescending smile and a weary shake of the head. He knows the Dragon of the North Sea does not exist. HARALD Darkness and ignorance... Meanwhile Ivar the Boneless and Sven the Berserk are both suffering from the effects of the sea. SVEN (keeping a wave of nausea down) It's not so bad when you're rowing. THORFINN SKULL-SPLITTER That's right Thorfinn gobs onto the whetstone with which he is sharpening his axe. Sven can control himself no longer. He rushes for the side. SVEN THE BERSERK I want to die. This sets off Ivar. IVAR THE BONELESS Uh oh! He leaps up and pukes over the side. Mass puking breaks out all over the boat. Keitel Blacksmith looks around at his preoccupied shipmates, and it slowly dawns upon him that this might be the moment to try a little sabotage. He goes to the ship's lodestone, which is hanging from the mast. Keitel glances around. No one is looking, but this sort of covert behaviour goes against his normally sunny and open disposition. KEITEL (to himself) The Blacksmith's Code... He steels himself, takes down the lodestone, snaps out the piece of metal in the base and throws it over the side. Keitel hangs it up again on the mast. THORFINN Are you all right? IVAR No, I'm not. THORFINN You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know. IVAR How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick? THORFINN I mean many of the greatest sailors were. Pause. IVAR I know. I know. THORFINN Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke. IVAR Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL. Thorfinn pauses and waits for a wave of nausea to creep up on Ivar. THORFINN He used to puke in his sleep. IVAR Bastard. He throws up. Meanwhile Erik is in the stern, gazing out behind them. ERIK Thorfinn... look over there. Thorfinn leaves Ivar and joins Erik. On the horizon a sinister sail is following them. Thorfinn grins with evil pleasure. He scents a fight. Erik turns to the crew. ERIK Break out the oars! Thorfinn's smile disappears and he spins round to confront Erik. THORFINN What are you talking about? ERIK (to his reluctant crew) Come on, move it! Most of the men are being sea-sick. MORD FIDDLE We've only just started cooking lunch. The crew glance at Mord Fiddle and then throw up again. ERIK Move it! Reluctantly the crew take up their rowing positions. Thorfinn buttonholes Erik (except of course that he doesn't have any buttonholes). THORFINN It's Halfdan the Black! ERIK I know. Snorri! Get your oar out! Snorri is sitting in position but without his oar. Keitel has meanwhile joined them. He, too, stares at the horizon. He is a little puzzled by this turn of events. Loki has said nothing about Halfdan coming after them. KEITEL (uneasily) Do you suppose he wants to stop us waking the Gods? Erik looks at Keitel with a certain amount of contempt. Keitel is not renowned even amongst these Vikings for his brain-power. ERIK What do you think? KEITEL But how could he know... unless... Keitel stops in mid-sentence as he realizes it must be Loki's doing. THORFINN (scornfully) So are you going to run away from him, Erik? Erik turns to Thorfinn. ERIK Row, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter. Thorfinn hesitates. ERIK And you, Keitel Blacksmith. KEITEL But... Keitel shrugs and turns to take up his rowing position. He is still a little confused by this turn of events. Erik confronts Thorfinn. ERIK I gave an order. Or didn't you hear? There is something about Erik's manner that carries an authority that Thorfinn cannot argue with. ERIK Come on, Ivar. Erik manhandles Ivar over to his drum and thrusts his drumsticks into his hands. Halfdan's ship is twice the size of Erik's and, as Erik is only too well aware, consequently travels at twice the speed. There is no real chance of them escaping, unless... Erik suddenly catches sight of a thick bank of mist in the distance, and steers his ship towards it. IVAR (still feeling ill) I want to die... (then, suddenly catching sight of Halfdan's ship behind him) No, I don't! ERIK Row! Row! Row! Ivar tries to get into the new rhythm, but has a bit of difficult. As Halfdan's ship gains on them inexorably, GOLDEN DRAGON glides into the sea mist. There is a tremendous roll of thunder very close. All the Vikings look scared. Erik, however, grins. ERIK Row! Row! Row! He doubles the speed. The drum beats faster. SVEN'S DAD (shouts out angrily) We can't keep this up! Erik grins and then leans on the steering oar. GOLDEN DRAGON curves around to its left. Then Erik lays his hand on Ivar's drum and silences it. ERIK Oars up! The Vikings ship their oars and sit there in the mist listening to beating of Halfdan's drum getting closer and closer. At the final moment, however, Halfdan swings his ship in the opposite direction from Erik's and the sound of his drum disappears into the mist. Erik's men breathe a sigh of relief... even Keitel Blacksmith... Fade. Fade up some time later. GOLDEN DRAGON is still drifting in the mist. Erik has his fish-lodestone and is trying the direction, but the lodestone is just swinging round uselessly. After trying a few times, Erik gives up and throws the lodestone away into the boat. The men peer into the thick mist; they are lost. Suddenly Erik sees something ahead. ERIK The Gates of the World... MORD FIDDLE What? GOLDEN DRAGON silently guides between two weird islands. ERIK We have passed through the Gates of the World (he looks around at the other) No we are in the Unknown... GOLDEN DRAGON drifts on and the mist gets thicker. There is a crash of thunder. Then a series of flashes lights up the mist around them. The Vikings are uneasy, sensing a storm brewing. Suddenly Erik points above them. The others look up too. They all gasp. ERIK (hardly daring to breathe) So THAT is what the sun looks like! Above them hangs a luminous yellow globe, its light just breaking through the mist. VIKING (to each other) The sun! It's the sun! Look! SVEN'S DAD (in wonderment) I never though I should live to see the sun again. HARALD MISSIONARY Where? The Vikings all gaze up above them in awe. Harald looks from one to the other and then tries to follow their eyelines. He clearly can't see it. Magic music fills the air. Suddenly the "sun" swoops off to one side and starts swaying from one side to another. ERIK Should the sun do that? HARALD MISSIONARY What are you looking at? ERIK Look out! VIKINGS Ah! The Vikings scream and flatten themselves against the sides of the boat, as the "sun" suddenly lurches down on them out of the sky, revealing for the first time that it is NOT the sun at all but a strange monster with a long neck that disappears off into the mist and a glowing globe for a head, and huge chomping jaws. The Vikings are, understandably, terrified. VIKINGS It's not the sun! It's not the sun! HARALD MISSIONARY What is it? SNORRI It's the Dragon of the North Sea! HARALD MISSIONARY (knowingly) Ah! THAT'S why I can't see it. As the Dragon of the North Sea rises up again, however, its jaw apparently drops off and falls to the deck, and lands on Snorri. SNORRI Aaah! Keitel nervously picks it up and holds it up for everyone to see. I is a strand of sea-weed. The Vikings are non-plussed. They look back at their now jawless monster. Harald Missionary picks up the sea-weed. HARALD Some dragon! Ooh! He tosses it back amongst his terrifies companions. Suddenly there is an incredibly loud clap of thunder and flames shoot out of the mist. SVEN Look out! As... unbelievably... a huge monstrous visage looms out of the mist... It is a creature from the nethermost depths of the ocean... and the incandescent globe is no more than a sprouting on the end of its nose! More fire shoots out from its nostrils and sends all the Vikings (and even Harald Missionary) diving for the deck. Then the monstrous head disappears back into the mist as quickly as it came, taking its light with it... The Vikings are paralysed with fear for one brief moment. ERIK Row! ROW! They all scramble for the oars in a determined hysteria. Ivar the drummer, in his panic, has set a ridiculously fast rate and nobody can keep up with it. ERIK Slower! Nobody can row at that speed! IVAR (hoarsely) Sorry. HARALD What's all the panic about? SVEN'S DAD (in a panic, shouting back over his shoulder) The Dragon... Harald gives a patronising smile. HARALD Children afraid of the dark... Suddenly there is another roar, and flames shoot out of the mist and across the deck of GOLDEN DRAGON. One man, Ornolf Fishdriver, who hasn't had much to say so far, is set on fire. Another, Bjarni Jerusalem-Farer, who has and will have even less to say then Ornolf Fishdriver, leaps out of the way of the flames and falls over the side. THORFINN Man over board! Thorfinn starts trying to fish him out. Ivar has started to panic and is beating the drum too fast. ERIK Slower! In... Out... IVAR Sorry! SVEN (his eyes showing their whites) We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill! SVEN'S DAD Not now, Sven... SVEN I must KILL! Kill! SVEN'S DAD It's no good going berserk against a dragon! Sven's dad slaps him around the face. There is another roar from the monster. Erik turns to Ivar. ERIK Faster! IVAR Make your mind up. Suddenly the Dragon's head appears out of the mists above them once again. There is panic amongst the Vikings as some start to row faster than others. Screams. ERIK Keep up the strike! The Dragon's jaws open. Flame licks out, and down the centre of the vessel. There are screams as the Vikings leap out of the way. Sven goes berserk again. SVEN KILL! KILL! SVEN'S DAD Stop it! The Dragon's eyes dilate and its jaws open. The men throw themselves to the deck as if expecting more fire. But instead the creature's fangs crash into the wood of the stern of GOLDEN DRAGON. ERIK ROW! SVEN DEATH! SVEN'S DAD Shut UP! ERIK Row! Erik looks around at his terror-stricken crew. He realizes this is an important moment. It is up to him to save the situation. Suddenly an idea occurs to him, as he catches sight of the pillow that his mother gave him. ERIK Keep rowing! Erik dashes to his sea-chest under the mast and pulls out the pillow. THORFINN Erik! Row! What are you doing? ERIK (holding up the pillow) It saved my father! Erik starts to shin up the mast. SNORRI Barmy. Sven's dad is desperately holding Sven back. SVEN'S DAD HOLD it! HOLD it in! SVEN DEATH TO DRAGONS! ERIK Row! SNORRI Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat? Erik has reached the top of the mast and is now right up with the incandescent globe on the end of the long stalk that grows onto the monster's nose. He grabs hold of it and swings across onto the monster's nose. At his moment Sven breaks free of his dad and throws himself onto one of the Dragon's teeth. SVEN Red mist! He bangs his head against the monstrous denture. Sven's dad looks heavenward in despair. Cut to Harald Missionary who is offering his bible to the petrifies Vikings in the prow. HARALD It's at time like this that you'll find this book MOST useful, you know... Keitel takes the bible from him and hits him over the head with it. KEITEL Row! You idiot! The monster's eyes dilate wildly as they try to focus on the tiny figure of Erik on its snout. Erik shoves the pillow up one of the Dragon's nostrils. Snorri watches Erik incredulously. He shakes his head. SNORRI His father went crazy too... Used to take forty winks in the middle of a battle... Thorfinn frowns - he has a glimmering of an idea of what Erik is doing. Erik now plunges his sword through the pillow in the Dragon's nostril, and feathers immediately fly into the air. ERIK Now... take a deep breath. The Dragon goes cross-eyed, trying to see what's going on on its snout. ERIK Go on! Breathe in, you cod-brain! Meanwhile the Dragon's tongue suddenly licks out around its tooth. Sven instantly slices through it with his sword. The bright blood spurts, like bursting a sausage. The Dragon gives an agonized roar and a sharp intake of breath. The feathers that have leaked out from the pillow are instantly sucked inside and the whole pillow disappears right up the Dragon's nose. For a moment everyone holds their breath. The Dragon's eye dilate wildly. Then it wrinkles its snout. Then it starts what is unmistakably a sneeze. THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA Ah... ah... ah... ERIK Hold TIGHT! THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA Ah... ah... ah... Erik leaps back across the mast. THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA CHOO!! A hurricane of wind and feathers blasts out of the Dragon's nostrils and hits all the Vikings at once. Everyone is disgusted by the Dragon's breath. SNORRI Urgh! What's it been eating? But the blast has already catapulted the boat into the sky, and it hurtles through the clouds. leaving the Dragon of the North Sea far behind. They all look up at Erik and cheer. Shot of Erik. He doesn't look too happy. Neither does Ivar the Boneless, because he too has just noticed that they are now flying and the ocean is several thousand feet below them. Ivar screams. The other all rush to the side to look too. ERIK No! No! Get back! Unfortunately they all rush to the SAME side and the boat tips over with far more instability than when it is in the water. Leif and Thangbrand are catapulted down into the sea. We watch them descend into tiny dots and tiny unheard splashes below. THORFINN Who was that? SNORRI Leif the Lucky. Others are almost falling out. There is renewed panic. ERIK Get back! Poor Erik is still up the mast but has been dislodged and is now hanging on by his hands, dangling over the open sea. Some of the men - Thorfinn and Sven the Berserk amongst them - are hauling themselves up the almost vertical slope of the deck, trying to redress the balance. Meanwhile Keitel Blacksmith is dangling by one hand. KEITEL I can't hold on! I can't hold on! Sven worms his way along the edge - at great peril to himself - and grabs Keitel's wrist just as his fingers slip. KEITEL Aaagh! SVEN Got you! Keitel looks up in Sven's eyes. He is totally at Sven's mercy. What thoughts are going through his mind? How is he going to betray Sven in future if he is rescued? Guilt suddenly overwhelms him. KEITEL Let me go, Sven. SVEN What are you talking about? KEITEL I'm not worth risking your life for. SVEN I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too... KEITEL For your own sake... For the others... I... SVEN Hang on... The boat begins to right itself just as Erik finally can't hold on any more, and he plummets, straight into the ship, and through the bottom up to his waist. His legs dangle. At the same moment the prov of the boat tips and suddenly they are plummeting down towards the ocean. They hit the water with an almighty splash. Erik is thrown clear of the hull by the force of the water now cascading up through the hole he has made. SNORRI First we're flying - now we're sinking! ERIK Well, come on! He whisks off his helmet and starts bailing. All follow suit. Night falls. Some time later. The Vikings are still bailing out, but the water is up to their thighs. IVAR THE BONELESS Who are we fooling? It's hopeless! Ivar flings down the helmet with which he's been bailing. The others look at each other. They are reconciled to the fact that they are going to drown. HARALD MISSIONARY (hopelessly) Let's sing something! SNORRI Anyone know any good drowning songs? The suggestion falls flat. ERIK Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy-Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men. SNORRI Like fish. SVEN Shut up. THORFINN (raising his sword) Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla. IVAR I don'T want to die! HARALD MISSIONARY Isn't there ANYBODY who'd like to be christened before we go down? Silence. A distinct lack of enthusiasm. HARALD It can't do you any HARM... SVEN'S DAD What do we have to do? HARALD Nothing... I just immerse you in water... THORFINN AND OTHERS Get lost... The ship creaks and starts to go under. Erik picks his up his sword. The others follow suit. ERIK Don't let me drown, Thorfinn! Water starts to pour over the sides of the boat. Erik and Thorfinn raise their swords to each other. THORFINN Till we meet in Valhalla. They all prepare to run each other through. The boat sinks rapidly. IVAR THE BONELESS I'm too young! Oh Odin! Not me! Please not me! Perhaps I'd rather drown... HARALD MISSIONARY I do WISH you'd let me convert you. Then Erik pauses in his attempt to kill Thorfinn and looks around. The ship has sunk, but the prow and the stern posts are still sticking up out of the water, and the Vikings themselves are only up to their chests. ERIK How deep IS the ocean? THORFINN Very deep... usually... The realization gradually dawns on the Vikings that they're not going to sink any more. ERIK Wait! Nobody kill anybody! Fade. Fade up on the sun shining down from a blue sky. The Vikings have fallen asleep where we last saw them - up to their necks in water. Gradually the warmth of the sun coaxes them awake - Thorfinn is the first to look up and see the brilliant shining orb in the sky. THORFINN What is it? IVAR THE BONELESS (he panics and turns) It's the Dragon again! ERIK No.. no, it isn't... Ivar has turned and is staring at something else. ERIK Look, the sky is blue... SVEN'S DAD The sun! That's it! Ivar, meanwhile, is recovering from the amazement that has immobilized him. He taps Erik on the shoulder. Erik turns and he, too, gasps. ERIK Look! They all turn to see they are standing in the shallow waters of a natural harbour. Above nestle the white walls of a beautiful city set in a green and pleasant land. VIKINGS Yeaaaah! The Vikings wade ashore, enchanted by the paradise they see before them. All at once Thorfinn spies something. He draws his sword and they all approach with caution to find that under a weeping willow tree lies the most beautiful girl. She is raven-haired, scantily dressed and fast asleep. The Vikings approach her with trepidation, their swords and axes drawn. They glance around uneasily. SNORRI (whispers) She's got no clothes on! THORFINN It's disgusting. ERIK Get her weapons. Sven kneels quietly beside the girl. She stirs. Sven freezes. The others look around fearfully. SVEN (whispers) She hasn't got any. ERIK (incredulous) She MUST have a knife or something... But they look. She hasn't. THORFINN What kind of place IS this? IVAR THE BONELESS P... p...perhaps they've got weapons we haven't even dreamed of... Suddenly the girl stirs again in her sleep. The Vikings retreat several paces and grip their weapons, and glance around as if expecting an ambush. THORFINN Let's hack her to pieces. ERIK No. KEITEL Well, what else do we do? ERIK How about making friends? SVEN (with disgust) "FRIENDS"? VIKINGS Eurrgh! ERIK What's wrong with making friends? THORFINN You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends". SVEN We can make "friends" at home... This conversation has woken the girl, Aud. AUD Welcome! The Vikings react with terror, take a step back and raise their swords and axes. ERIK WHAT did you say? AUD I said welcome. ERIK (suspiciously) WELCOME? AUD Well, of course. We always welcome friends. The Vikings look at each other and at their swords. They don't think they look that much like friends themselves. ERIK How d'you KNOW we're "friends"? AUD Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy-Brasil. SVEN Hy-Brasil? ERIK Is THIS Hy-Brasil? AUD Well, of course. The Vikings erupt into an impromptu dance of joy, hugging each other and waving their swords in the air. AUD Please! Please! What are those? ERIK What are what? AUD Those things in your hands. ERIK These? What are THESE? They're swords. Aud instantly recoils with terror. AUD Oh no! NO! Out them down! PUT THEM DOWN! The Vikings gradually cease their mock battles and turn to look at Aud with incredulity. ERIK What's the matter? AUD PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing! ERIK What? AUD Put them down! (To Erik) PLEASE make them put them down. THORFINN Why? OTHERS Yes, why? AUD WHY? ERIK Yes. AUD But surely you know...? VIKINGS Er... n... no... ERIK Know what? Cut to big close-up of King Arnulf. KING ARNULF The wonderful blessing under which we live here on Hy-Brasil! The king beams. The Vikings shift uneasily. They look out of place and extremely scruffy in the midst of the scantily dressed courtiers of Hy-Brasil. Aud sits beside her father the King. ERIK No... we don't... KING ARNULF The Gods decreed that if ever sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves. King Arnulf beams rapturously at the Vikings, expecting them to be overjoyed. Instead they are horrified. THORFINN That's terrible! ERIK You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed? KING ARNULF Yes! (He thinks: isn't it wonderful?) The Vikings look at each other, feeling they haven't quite understood. THORFINN You mean... you can't kill ANYBODY? KING ARNULF Right! Isn't it wonderful? The Vikings are non-plussed. THORFINN What? Not being able to kill anybody? KING ARNULF (bemused) Well, of course. ERIK (interested) How? KING ARNULF (explaining the obvious) Well... for a start... er... there's no killing... ERIK Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing. KING ARNULF Well... (isn't it great?) THORFINN But how d'you take revenge? KEITEL (guiltily) How do you punish people? IVAR How do you DEFEND yourselves? KING ARNULF (getting a little irritated) We don't have to. We're all terribly nice to each other. Aren't we? COURT Yes! Aud catches Erik's eye and gives him a dangerously slow wink. A pause of disbelief from the Vikings. SVEN ALL the time? KING ARNULF Well, of course! We HAVE to be. He turns and conducts the courtiers, who chant in unison: COURT "Being nice to each other is what it's all about." KING ARNULF (rising as if to sing) You see? We're terribly nice to each other We're friendly bold and free. We never say anything nasty 'Cause we dare not... COURT (almost SINGING) No sirreeeee! They hold the note while King Arnulf looks anxiously at the Vikings. KING ARNULF Would you like us o sing to you? ERIK That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're... King Arnulf claps and the court stop singing. KING ARNULF What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing? ERIK Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and - KING ARNULF You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you? ERIK Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is... KING ARNULF A lot of people like our singing. ERIK I'm sure it's lovely. KING ARNULF But you don't want to hear it. ERIK (changing tack) No... no... (he looks at the others) We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we? VIKINGS Oh... yes. KING ARNULF Well, you'll have to ask us REALLY nicely. ERIK (realizing he has to be diplomatic) Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us. KING ARNULF You're just saying that. SVEN Well, of course he is! SVEN'S DAD Sh! They restrain Sven. ERIK Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing. KING ARNULF REALLY? ERIK Really. KING ARNULF And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to? Erik swallows hard. ERIK No. (He bites the lie) KING ARNULF Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM- TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM" COURT (disappointed) Oh... CHAMBERLAIN REALLY? KING ARNULF (apologetically to Vikings) It isn't the one we're BEST at. CHAMBERLAIN Couldn't we do the one that goes "TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM"? The rest of the court look hopeful. KING ARNULF (whispering) Not when we've got guests. VOICE FROM COURT How about the one that goes "TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TI-TUM"? KING ARNULF Don't be silly. CHAMBERLAIN That was a stupid suggestion. VOICE Sorry! I just thought they might like to hear something that we can do. ANOTHER Yes! At least we know that one. YET ANOTHER VOICE Nobody knows the "TUM-TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM" one. REST OF COURT No! Right! I agree! ODD MAN OUT I do! REST OF COURT Sh! ANOTHER VOICE It's too difficult! CHAMBERLAIN Sh! KING ARNULF All right. We'll do the one that goes "TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM- TI-TI-TUM". Ah! The musicians! The musicians are huge, unshaven, have broken noses and tattoos, and are covered in black oil - like mechanics. Their instruments are like heavy industrial machinery, pushed in large vats of black oil that drip all over the show. KING ARNULF Right... Oh dear... (he glances across at the Vikings) I'm sure you're not going to like this... Erik and the others smile reassuringly. There is a lot of coughing. The King raises his baton and then brings it down, humming to himself as he does so. There is a most awful din; caterwauling, crashing and banging, whining, screaming... The Vikings look at each other, trying to pick out some tune, but it's impossible. Ivar the Boneless can't stop himself bursting out into giggles and this eventually spreads to the other Vikings. King Arnulf notices and bangs the throne for silence. Gradually the din stops. King Arnulf sinks down in despair. KING ARNULF (tragically) We're just not a very musical nation... ERIK No, no... It was very... er, nice. KING ARNULF Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it? Erik thinks for some moments and then decides to make a clean breast of it. ERIK No. KING ARNULF (goes hysterically) They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die! The whole court looks as if it's about to commit mass HARA-KIRI, while the musicians look rather dangerous. Erik takes the moment to get down to business. ERIK Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. where men live and die by the axe and by the sword... KING ARNULF Well, how d'you think I feel? ERIK The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf. KING ARNULF YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing... Erik feels he is making a mess of all this diplomacy. ERIK We must find the Horn Resounding! The King glares at Erik. ERIK Is is HERE in Hy-Brasil? King Arnulf thinks for a moment and then speaks. KING ARNULF I'll tell you what... ERIK Yes? King Arnulf hesitates - he bites his lip and then takes the plunge. KING ARNULF We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM". Perhaps you'll like that better. Erik gives up. A lot of throat clearing. Aud, the King's daughter, gives Erik another dangerously slow wink. The terrible "music" starts up, shattering the calm of the beautiful city. Fade. Fade up on GOLDEN DRAGON now afloat once more, riding at anchor in the bay. Ivar is standing on guard in it. Suddenly he sees something that makes him gabe in horror. We don't find out what it is, however, because we immediately Cut to Erik. He is deeply in love. He is also in bed with the King's nubile daughter, Aud. AUD Have you ever felt like this about anyone else? ERIK What... you mean "got into bed with" them? AUD No, of course not, silly - I mean FELT like this about the? ERIK You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else? AUD No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams? ERIK HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else? AUD What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before... ERIK It was different... AUD (just for a moment it is Helga speaking) What was she like? ERIK Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well... AUD But you LOVED her all the same... ERIK We never went to bed together. AUD Why do you go on about that? What does it matter? ERIK You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you? AUD I've never LOVED anybody! ERIK I'VE never been to bed with anybody! Suddenly there is a banging on he door. KING ARNULF (v/o) Open up! I know you're in there! AUD Ah! It's my father! KING ARNULF (v/o) Open up! I know you're in there! Suddenly the note from Ivar's horn rings out across from the bay. Erik rushes to the window and looks out to see what Ivar saw previously: a black ship approaching on the horizon. ERIK Oh, no! Halfdan! There is more banging on the bedroom door. KING ARNULF (v/o) Aud! You've got someone in there again, haven't you? Erik gives her a sharp look. AUD Quick! Throw this over you! She throws a shabby bit of cloth over Erik and at that moment the door bursts open, and King Arnulf enters. KING ARNULF Right! Where is he? AUD Who, Father? KING ARNULF Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course! AUD There IS no one. The King starts prowling round the chamber. Erik stands there, naked and petrified, with the cloak hanging over his head, just where it landed. KING ARNULF I can SMELL one of those strangers... That's who it is, isn't it? Aud keeps mum. KING ARNULF This is the fifth one this week. Before he can stop himself, Erik blurts out: ERIK Fifth... Aud motions him to be quiet, but it's too late. The King spins round to see who she is signalling to. The King appears to be looking straight at Erik. Erik can hardly bear the suspense. KING ARNULF Well... where is he? AUD There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself. King Arnulf looks around the chamber carefully. He looks straight through Erik as if he weren't there. Suddenly the King strides over to Erik and Erik instinctively cowers out of the way. The King walks straight over to a very small cupboard no more than a foot high, flings the door of it open, and starts throwing clothes around the room. AUD He wouldn't be a midget, Father! The King turns on her. KING ARNULF Ah! So you admit there IS someone! AUD You're losing your temper! KING (becoming instantly pleasant) Of course I'm not. I never lose my temper... Ivar's horn sounds again. A shadow passes over King Arnulf's face. KING ARNULF Oh dear... more visitors! He strides to the window and sees Halfdan's ship. As he does so, Erik has to leap out of the way, inadvertently knocking a chest. The King spins round and addresses the chest. KING ARNULF Come out... come out like a man... I know you're in there... King Arnulf flings the chest open. revealing nothing but clothes. He is baffled. He reluctantly starts to leave. AUD (gently) It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other.... KING ARNULF I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic... He suddenly spies a small trinket-box and looks in that. But he doesn't find any strange man in it. AUD There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic... KING ARNULF She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day. AUD It's your fantasy... KING ARNULF But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her... He leaves. Aud closes the door. Erik throws the cloak off and starts getting dressed. AUD The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift. ERIK "The fifth one this week"! AUD Oh, for goodness' sake! ERIK And I thought you said it was something special... Aud runs to his side and puts her arms around him. AUD That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE... ERIK Five this week; how many the week before? AUD You're as bad as my father. ERIK And the week before that? ERIK Erik...! (she is really sincere) I want to help you get to Asgaard. Erik is torn. He doesn't know whether to believe her or not. Ivar's horn sounds for a third time. Erik races to the window. He looks out. Halfdan's ship is even closer. ERIK We mustn't let him land! AUD Who? ERIK Halfdan the Black. AUD But, Erik... But Erik is off out of the door. AUD No. Wait! My father will be - There is a thump and a yell as Erik is set upon by the King's two musicians. KING ARNULF I might have known it was you! MUSICIAN 1 (pinning Erik's arms behind him) I'm not hurting you, am I? ERIK What? MUSICIAN 2 You WILL tell us if we hurt you? They start to march Erik through the palace. ERIK Let me go! Erik struggles. KING ARNULF (to musicians) Careful! (to Erik) They're not supposed to hurt you. ERIK You've got to let me go! MUSICIAN 2 Oh no! We can hold onto you - just so long we don't squeeze too hard or bump you. In the distance we hear the horn again. ERIK Halfdan the Black's here! They have reached a cell. The musicians starts to chain Erik up. KING ARNULF It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well... ERIK They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow! MUSICIAN Ooh! I'm terribly sorry. KING ARNULF Who is Halfdan the Black? ERIK He's trying to stop us waking the Gods. KING ARNULF Why? ERIK Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder! KING ARNULF Don't talk nonsense. ERIK He wants to kill US! KING ARNULF Not when we explain about the Great Blessing. ERIK You don't know Halfdan the Black. KING ARNULF I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand. The horn sounds again. Erik is about to argue this point when Thorfinn suddenly bursts in. THORFINN Erik! MUSICIAN 2 We're not hurting him! MUSICIAN 1 (to Erik) Are we? ERIK Just let me go! THORFINN Halfdan the Black's here! ERIK I know! THORFINN (to the King) He wants to KILL us. They both look at King Arnulf. The King thinks. ERIK You don't want him to kill us ON Hy-Brasil! Do you? The King thinks some more. The horn sounds once more. Cut to GOLDEN DRAGON. Erik and the Vikings are scrambling into their war gear. They glance nervously over to where Halfdan the Black's ship is riding on the waves. THORFINN I feel strange. Erik looks at Thorfinn, shocked. IVAR THE BONELESS (his throat dry) Sort of wobbly and excited? THORFINN Sort of... IVAR That's fear. SVEN But Thorfinn doesn't know the meaning of fear. THORFINN Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach? IVAR That's it! ERIK But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn! THORFINN I know. I know. SVEN'S DAD It's magic. ERIK What "magic"? SVEN'S DAD I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight. SVEN (deadly serious) Yes... I can feel it. IVAR THE BONELESS (eagerly) I always feel like this! Suddenly Halfdan's ship rises up out of the water , and revealing the secret of its hidden power. Under the water-line is another line of oars! The Vikings are dumbfounded. Ivar drops trembling to his knees. The rest go white. Thorfinn draws his sword. Erik realizes his men are rapidly talking themselves into a blue funk. ERIK It's not magic! It's just a trick! THORFINN (turning on him angrily) Don't you FEEL it? Erik looks around at his paralysed crew. He realizes he is the only one who can save the situation. ERIK Very well! It they're using magic - we'll use magic of our own! He leaps out of GOLDEN DRAGON and races up to the shore towards the city of Hy-Brasil. Erik races into the Forum and gazes up at the high walls of the Palace. Without a thought he produces two daggers and plunges them into the stonework. Then he hauls himself up the sheer cliff of wall up to Aud's bedchamber fist over fist. It is, indeed, a prodigious feat. He arrives at Aud's window exhausted. Aud, who has appeared at the window, looks at him curiously. AUD Why didn't you come up by the stairs? Erik looks around and notices for the first time the magnificent flights of stairs leading up to the top of Aud's tower. ERIK (rather miffed) Just give me a hand. AUD I mean, you could have killed yourself. Erik clambers into Aud's room. ERIK Where's the Cloak Invisible? AUD Why? Erik looks around and is suddenly suspicious. ERIK I can't see it! (Indignation suddenly seizes him) Have you got another man in here? Erik starts feeling the air as if expecting to find an invisible body. AUD It's in the chest. Erik races over and grabs the cloak. AUD No! ERIK I'll bring it back. AUD Erik. You don't understand. ERIK No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him. AUD (pointing at the cloak) But you don't realize.... ERIK Goodbye, Aud... Erik leaps out of the window. For a moment Aud is surprised and then alarmed as she realizes he's jumped out of the window, which is some forty feet off the ground. AUD Erik! She rushes to the window in time to see Erik parachuting down, holding the four corners of the cloak. Erik lands safely and waves with the cloak. ERIK And thanks for the Cloak Invisible! AUD No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The CLoak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father! But Erik cannot hear her. He is already racing back to his ship. Back on GOLDEN DRAGON, Thorfinn is taking "Being Scared" lessons from Ivar the Boneless. THORFINN And a sort of slightly sick feeling? IVAR That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory. THORFINN Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that! SNORRI Oh, shut up, you two. You're making us ALL nervous. Erik leaps into GOLDEN DRAGON brandishing the Cloak Invisible. ERIK So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! (he holds up the Cloak Invisible) KEITEL What is it? SNORRI A magic dishcloth. ERIK To the oars! THORFINN D'you think I've got time to go behind that bush? Ivar starts to drum and the Vikings begin to row. GOLDEN DRAGON heads out of the harbour. Cut to Halfdan the Black flanked by his advisers, Gisli Oddsson and Eilif the Mongul. He gives a nod and Eilif bangs his staff of office on the deck, as a signal for the galley slaves to speed up. Down in the galley, the slave master (a diminutive Japanese) stalks down the decks lashing the sweat-streaked galley slaves and cursing them in incomprehensive Japanese. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) a translation appears in subtitles. SLAVE-DRIVER (subtitled) Row! You incomprehensible, horizontal-eyed, Western trouser-wearers! Eurgh! You all look the same to me! How I despise your lack of subtlety and your joined-up writing! You, who have never committed ritual suicide in your lives! SLAVE (whispering to his neighbour) You know, I don't think it would be so bad, if we knew what he was saying... SLAVE-DRIVER SILENCE! Unceremonious rice-pudding eaters! How I abominate your milk-drinking and your lack of ancestor-worship and your failure to eat your lunch out of little boxes! Meanwhile the Vikings are growing increasingly uneasy as they row towards Halfdan. SVEN'S DAD What "magic" have you brought, Erik? ERIK You'll see! At this point, back on the Black Ship, Halfdan gives another nod and Eilif raps out yet another command with his staff. This time the prow of the Black Ship opens up like a pair of jaws. The Vikings see it and panic. IVAR THE BONELESS I've done it! THORFINN Oh, yes... (he has too!) Halfdan nods again and another order is rapped out. This time a harpoon is fired from the prow. It thuds into gOLDEN DRAGON and two of Halfdan's dog-soldiers start to winch the line in. The two ships are hauled closer and closer. The Vikings panic even more. Erik holds up the Cloak Invisible and grins round at his men, knowing he is going to surprise them. ERIK Here! Here is the magic from the King's daughter! Erik's men watch, half sceptical and half hopeful. Erik enjoys the moment of suspense. The he throws the Cloak Invisible over his head and shoulders and grins round at his men triumphantly, imagining he has vanished from their sight. ERIK There! I have become the wind! The Vikings look at him, rather puzzled. Only Harald seems to be impressed. HARALD How did he do that? SVEN'S DAD Do what? HARALD Vanish into thin air? SVEN'S DAD He hasn't. HARALD Well, where is he then? Harald looks around. He is the only one who can't see Erik. SVEN'S DAD He's THERE! At this point Halfdan's ship suddenly bites into the side of GOLDEN DRAGON. Erik leaps onto the side of GOLDEN DRAGON and swings across onto Halfdan's ship. The Vikings react to the horror of Halfdan's ship biting into GOLDEN DRAGON and to Erik's blithe leap onto the enemy boat. Erik lands on the deck of Halfdan's ship, and grins at the ferocious skull-helmeted dog-soldiers. ERIK Ooh! Scary! Scary! Don't we look mean? Two dog-soldiers look at each other, totally non-plussed. Erik grimaces at Halfdan's men, and does a little pirouette to show them all that he's invisible from every angle. ERIK You can't see me! But I can see you! He breaks into a little dance. Halfdan glares at his advisers. HALFDAN What's going on? GISLI ODDSSON That's Erik. HALFDAN Well, why isn't he scared of us? Erik, meanwhile approaches one of the dog-soldiers and makes silly faces at him. ERIK Boo! The dog-soldier topples overboard. The galley slaves watch another dog-soldier fall into the hold amongst them and lie there stunned. His sword falls onto the deck between the slaves. One of the slaves throws down his oar, and picks up the dog-soldier's sword. The slave-master suddenly appears. Once again he speaks immaculate JApanese. SLAVE-MASTER (subtitled) Hey! What's going on? Your big-breasted women give me no pleasure with their warmed-up fish and... Urgh! The slave-master strides down the ship to flay the offending slave, but another slave trips him up and in a twinkling of an eye four others have leapt on the slave-master (despite their chains) and are extracting his keys. HALFDAN What's the matter? Haven't you seen anyone fight before? DOG-SOLDIER 1 No. DOG-SOLDIER 2 They're usually too scared of us. HALFDAN KILL him! Erik, still thinking he's invisible, is running amongst the dog- soldiers, having fun. He runs one dog-soldier through and kicks another overboard, then he runs past a few more, right up to Halfdan himself. He whisks the Cloak Invisible off his head for an instant. ERIK (thinking he's revealing himself) Here I am! Then he turns and is off. Halfdan turns to his aides. HALFDAN What? Back on GOLDEN DRAGON, the Vikings' disbelief has turned to admiration. SVEN'S DAD There! THAT'S a true Berserk. SVEN I'm just building up to it, Dad. Sven starts banging his head on the side of the boat. SNORRI He's gone batty! THORFINN No! The fear's gone! Halfdan grabs a sword off one of his dead dog-soldiers and thrusts it into the unwilling hands of his military adviser, Eilif. HALFDAN Fight, damn you! Fight! Cut back to GOLDEN DRAGON. Now Sven leaps across onto Halfdan's ship followed by Ivar, yelling. Snorri looks back at Keitel. SNORRI Well! Come on! KEITEL I... I... Keitel is thinking: "Maybe I should let Halfdan win" but he knows he can't let a thing like that happen, now he is faced with the reality of it. The companionship of the voyage has brought them all too close for that. KEITEL (under his breath) Hang the Blacksmith's Code! Keitel leaps to his feet and joins in the attack. Erik, meanwhile, is swinging across the deck from a rope. ERIK I am the air! I am the wind! Keitel and Thorfinn are now fighting side by side. THORFINN This is life, eh? Keitel grins and strikes out. Ivar turns on Eilif who has reluctantly joined the fray. Maybe he's singled Ivar out as the most harmless. Ivar suddenly realizes he's only armed with drumsticks. Eilif smiles evilly. IVAR Ooh... er... Eilif's sword slices through Ivar's drumsticks. Ivar turns to run, but is stopped by a dog-soldier. Eilif takes the opportunity to run him through from behind. IVAR (as he dies) Ouch. Erik sees Ivar's demise. ERIK Ivar! Erik leaps to take revenge. He jumps into the galley-pit and out again a la Douglas Fairbanks in THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD and dispatches Eilif with a single thrust. Sven and his dad are fighting surrounded by dog- soldiers. SVEN'S DAD Well, go on! Go berserk! SVEN GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad! Snorri appears from behind. SNORRI (to Sven's dad) What about you? Why don't YOU go berserk? SVEN'S DAD I got to keep my eye on HIM... Sven's dad looks uneasy. He is surrounded and, as a seasoned campaigner, knows they haven't much chance. Halfdan smiles to himself. The battle is going his way. Thorfinn meanwhile is fighting two dog- soldiers but is attacked from behind by a third. SVEN Look out! Thorfinn! But it's too late. Thorfinn is run through the back. Sven goes berserk and kills all three dog-soldiers. Sven's dad looks on, proud of his son for the first time. Maybe their relationship will never be the same again. Now Snorri sees something that cheers him up. SLaves are coming up from below to join the battle. They are armed with oars and swords. They join the fray, knocking dog-soldiers overboard with their oars. The dog-soldier are suddenly outnumbered. Halfdan's smile fades, and he looks around for an escape route. The tide of battle has now turned dramatically as dog-soldier after dog-soldier is tossed over the side or laid low by the combination of Vikings and slaves. Halfdan and Gisli slip into a lifeboat and sneak off. The rats are leaving the sinking ship. Back on the deck, all the dog-soldiers are dead or overboard. The slaves and Vikings are cheering and embracing each other. At the other end of the boat, Sven is cradling the dying Thorfinn in his arms. All around are jubilant slaves celebrating their freedom. SVEN Thorfinn! You can't die! THORFINN I'm not frightened... of anything... SVEN You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla! THORFINN (dying) No... he's not... not... there... SVEN Tell him I'm coming! Thorfinn dies. Sven holds him and a tear comes down his face. The danger has made comrades of the two rivals. Erik, however, is still fighting a last lone dog-soldier; but just as he is about to run him through the dog-soldier is stabbed in the back. He sinks to the floor, revealing another dog-soldier. Erik is outraged by this act of treachery and turns on the assassin. DOG-SOLDIER No! No" Wait! Please wait, Erik! The dog-soldier pulls his mask off to reveal he is, in fact, Loki. Erik is totally non-plussed. ERIK LOKI! Where did YOU come from? LOKI Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans. Erik has meanwhile been joined by the remaining comrades. LOKI To save YOU, Erik. Erik is about to say "But how can you see me? I'm wearing the Cloak Invisible." ERIK But - LOKI It was my master Keitel's idea. All eyes turn on Keitel who looks very uncomfortable. LOKI Wasn't it, Keitel? KEITEL Well... I... I thought... Keitel is overcome b the power of Loki's will, but he is deeply ashamed of his complicity in Loki's deeds. Snorri gazes at Keitel with growing suspicion. ERIK But... How is it you can see me? (he looks round) You can all see me? LOKI What d'you mean? SNORRI AND OTHERS Why shouldn't we see you? HARALD I can't see him. ERIK I'm wearing the Cloak Invisible.... Erik takes it off to demonstrate. HARALD Oh! There you are! ERIK (to the others) You mean... you could see me all the time? The Vikings look at each other, mystified. SNORRI Weren't we supposed to? ERIK Oh... I feel a little... oh... Erik's knees give way and he faints onto the deck. Cut to King's Hall some time later. A victory celebration is in progress. It is a little bit like a Hampstead cocktail party, and the rough, battle-stained Vikings look rather out of place holding their little canapes. Suddenly the King claps for silence. KING ARNULF We are grateful to you, Erik, and to your men... COURT Yes, we are... KING ARNULF And there is only ONE way we can repay you... Musicians! King arnulf claps his hands. Erik rushes over to him, anxious to avoid another Hy-Brasilian concert. ERIK (hurriedly) Well, we'd love to hear you sing again, but what we'd really appreciate would be if you could see your way to lending... not giving of course... (continuing)... but just lending us the.... um... the, well, to be quite blunt... the Horn Resounding. All the time Erik is talking the doors of the hall behind are opening and a vast lur or horn is carried in by six bearers. One or two of the Vikings have turned to look and are now standing speechless. King Arnulf beams at Erik. KING ARNULF It's yours. Now Erik finally turns and looks at what everyone else is looking at. Erik's jaw drops. Everyone in the court beams at Erik,except Aud who is looking sad and disappointed. ERIK (when he can find his voice) Is THAT it? A cloud passes over King Arnulf's happy face. KING ARNULF Is there something the matter with it? ERIK Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big. KING ARNULF Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing. (aside) You DO know how to play the horn, don't you? ERIK Yes... oh, yes... KING ARNULF Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning. The King manhandles Erik away from his daughter. Perhaps we have the feeling that she's isn't going to let Erik go as easily as that...Mix through to later that night. The Vikings are lying asleep on the Great Hall, beside the Horn Resounding. The camera closes in on Keitel. Suddenly a voice comes from the shadows: VOICE (whispering) Keitel! Keitel Blacksmith! Keitel opens his eyes and finds Loki close beside him. LOKI What's the matter, Keitel Blacksmith? Have you forgotten why you came on this voyage? Keitel is silent. LOKI Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods? KEITEL How can we stops him now? Loki looks around and then opens his hand in front of Keitel. In it is the mouthpiece from the Horn Resounding. LOKI Take this and throw it from the cliff heights. They'll never make the Horn Resounding sound without it. Keitel frowns. Then an obvious thought limps across his muscular mind. KEITEL But why me? Why don't you do it? Somebody stirs. LOKI Sh! Hurry! KEITEL YOU do it! LOKI You'll be able to throw it further than I could. Keitel thinks. This is true. LOKI It must go far out to sea. Loki presses the mouthpiece on Keitel. Keitel takes it, but reluctantly. Another Viking stirs. LOKI Surely you haven't forgotten the Blacksmith's Oath? Keitel is about to reply and say he's been having second thoughts about it, but somehow he can't. Loki has such power over him. KEITEL I... Suddenly another Viking stirs, and Loki hisses at him. LOKI Hurry! Loki pretend to go back to sleep. Keitel (feeling a bit lumbered) thinks about his task and hesitates... Who knows? Perhaps he is about to stand firm, but Loki plays his trump card. LOKI (without opening his eyes) Or I might have to tell Erik why you really came on this voyage. Keitel is caught. He closes his eyes in resignation and then reluctantly starts to make his way out of the Hall. As he gets to the doors he trips over Snorri, who wakes. The mouthpiece falls a few feet away. SNORRI Who's that? KEITEL It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... (he gives a false laugh) SNORRI Oh... Snorri notices the silver mouthpiece on the floor, but he pretends he hasn't. SNORRI Oh... clumsy idiot. Snorri pretends to go back to sleep, but he opens one eye and watches Keitel Blacksmith recover the mouthpiece, and then follows Keitel out. Loki gets up too. He follows to keep an eye on Snorri. Cut to Aud on the shore, gazing moodily out to sea. She is brooding in Erik's imminent departure. Suddenly a stone falls from above; she looks up and sees a figure appear on the cliff above. Hurriedly she withdraws into the shadows. Keitel Blacksmith appears on the cliff-top. In his hands he holds the mouthpiece of the Horn Resounding. e examines it, turning over in his mind whether he is doing the right thing or not. then he decides he must. KEITEL (to himself) My fellow blacksmiths. He prepares to throw it. SNORRI Keitel! Keitel jumps out of his skin. KEITEL What? SNORRI What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith? KEITEL Get away, Snorri. SNORRI What have you got there? Snorri advances towards Keitel. Keitel backs away, dangerously near to the edge of the cliff. His boot slips and he jerks himself forward. At the same time Snorri makes a grab for the mouthpiece. A scuffle ensues, during which the mouthpiece of the Horn Resounding is dropped. It bounces off the cliff and falls down to the shore below. Aud steps out of the shadow and picks it up. She frowns and looks up, and then screams, as she sees the men fighting. AUD No! But it's too late. Snorri goes white, gives a hideous gasp... and sinks slowly to his knees - revealing Loki standing behind him with a bloody knife. As Keitel and Loki watch Snorri die, a drop of blood from the knife falls to the ground. The moment it lands, there is a deep subterranean groan, and the earth begins to tremble violently. Keitel and Loki look around in alarm. KEITEL Oh Gods! What have we done? Back in the King's Hall, Sven, Sven's dad and Harald are wide awake, but for the moment paralysed, as bits of masonry crash around them. The cheerful figure of King Arnulf appears at the top of a stairway. He raises his hands. KING ARNULF Stay calm! This is NOT happening. The King then hurries out of a door at the top of the staircase. SVEN'S DAD What did he say? ERIK Look out! The doors of the Great Hall burst open and a wall of water crashes through, knocking the Vikings off their feet. There is little doubt that the whole of Hy-Brasil is sinking see a street go down, a statue sink and then we Cut to a close-up of King Arnulf. He is standing at the top of the Forum steps addressing a crowd of anxious citizens. They are keeping surprisingly good order considering they are already standing ankle-deep in water, and the whole town is rapidly sinking around them. KING ARNULF Now, I know what some of you must be thinking... the day has come.... we're all going down, etc. etc. But let's get away from the fantasy and look at the FACTS. FACT ONE - The threat of total destruction has kept the peace for one thousand years. FACT TWO - The chances of it failing now are therefore one in three hundred and sixty-five thousand. FACT THREE... By this time the water is up to people's knees, and several have crowded onto the lower steps to avoid getting wet. KING ARNULF FACT THREE - Our safety regulations are the most rigorous in the world. We are all nice to each other, we never rub each other up the wrong way or contradict each other, do we? CROWD No. Rumble. The buildings sink and masonry falls. CITIZEN We... er... do seem to be going down quite fast, Your Majesty - not trying to contradict you, course. KING ARNULF No, of course you're not, citizen. But let's stick to the facts. There has NEVER been a safer, more certain way of keeping the peace. So whatever's happening, you can rest assured, Hy-Brasil is NOT sinking. Repeat, NOT sinking. We cut to an unfortunate Hy-Brasilian who looks out of a window to see if it's raining, but is immersed before he can find out. The citizens in the Forum, however, are reassured by the King's words - even though they are now up to their waists in water. One of them steps forward. ANOTHER CITIZEN May I just make a point in support of what King Arnulf's just said? KING ARNULF We'd be delighted - wouldn't we? CITIZENS Yes, we'd certainly like to hear what one of us has got to say... Erik, Sven, Sven's dad and Harald struggle out of the Great Hall, carrying their belongings and the Horn Resounding, while the citizen is still speaking most articulately in support of the King. They are ALMOST in a panic. ERIK What are you all doing? CITIZEN AT THE BACK (cheerfully) It's all right. It's not happening. ERIK (urgently) The place is sinking! CITIZEN AT THE BACK Yes... I thought it was too, but the King's just pointed out that it can't be. CITIZEN (still speaking in support of the King) ...and, of course, we mustn't forget King Arnulf's EXCELLENT eye for flower-arranging. There is a smattering of applause. A few people pull their robes up out of the wet. Erik leaps onto a wall and shouts to the crowd. ERIK Save yourselves! Hy-Brasil... is sinking. There are a lot of knowing smiles amongst the citizens. CITIZEN FROM MIDDLE Look, you don't know our safety regulations. KING ARNULF It can't happen. ERIK But it IS! Look! KING ARNULF (ignoring Erik) The important thing is not to panic. CITIZENS Quite... yes... we understand.... KING ARNULF I've already appointed the Chancellor as Chairman of a committee to find out exactly what IS going on, and meantime I suggest we have a sing-song! CITIZENS Good idea! ANOTHER Can we do the one that goes "TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM"? Erik looks around in despair. Meanwhile in another street someone is struggling in the floodwater. LOKI I can't swim! I can't swim! KEITEL Relax! LOKI I'm drowning! Help! Loki grabs Keitel round the neck. KEITEL Let go! But Keitel is pulled under. He re-emerges spluttering. KEITEL Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot! LOKI Help! KEITEL You'll drown us bo... But they go under again. At this point Erik, Sven, Sven's dad and Harald swim round the corner, pushing the Horn Resounding. They see the figures disappearing under the water. KEITEL Help! LOKI Help! Erik, Sven and Co. swim as fast as they can to rescue the drowning pair. They struggle to overpower the panic-stricken Loki, but he puts up a manic fight. Unexpectedly, Harald Missionary suddenly unleashes a vicious right hook and lays Loki out cold. There is a moment's stunned silence that is no unmingled with indignation. SVEN (with hurt surprise) You hit him! HARALD Well, it's what you're supposed to do... isn't it? SVEN'S DAD Look! They look up as GOLDEN DRAGON sails around a corner of the street, piloted by Aud. As the Vikings scramble aboard, the sound of the "sing-song" reaches a particularly noisy and discordant climax attract their attention. Back in what was the Forum, a crowd of unconcerned-looking citizens is sitting on the last roof and just coming to the end of another appalling song. CITIZENS ...Te...Tum! KING You know, I think we're getting better. CITIZEN 1 (with genuine interest) How can you tell? KING (a bit stumped) Er... AUD Father! The King looks up. KING ARNULF It's all right! It isn't happening! AUD But, Father, it IS! ERIK Get on board! CITIZEN 2 No THANKS! CITIZEN 3 Who do you think YOU are? CITIZEN 1 Panic-monger! The roof is now sinking rapidly, though the citizens appear as unperturbed as ever. CITIZEN Leave us alone! SVEN Yeah. Leave 'em alone. AUD It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking! KING ARNULF Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you... Unfortunately, at this point, the entire gathering of citizens, the King and the Forum Temple disappear below the waves. AUD Father! (tears spring to her eyes) Harald Missionary has put his arm around Aud in a fatherly way. HARALD MISSIONARY There, my child... It's at times like this that this book can be a great help... Erik shoos him away. HARALD MISSIONARY (with his usual promptness) Right! GOLDEN DRAGON spins alone in the wide ocean. Fade. Fade up some time later. They are all gathered in front of the Horn Resounding. ERIK (to himself) We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard... SVEN (nervously and with awe in his voice) Over the Edge of the World. The other men look up at the Horn Resounding, and begin to feel a bit nervous. ERIK We are going where only the dead have been before... Erik takes a deep breath and then puts his lips to the Horn Resounding. He blows. There is a splutter, and one or two of the Vikings titter amongst themselves. He has another go. But again, all he produces is a pathetic spluttering. SVEN (not unkindly in his manner) Uh! Here! Give it to me! Sven pushes Erik aside. Sven blow... he becomes redder and redder. But all he produces is a splutter. He gets a bit angry. SVEN Thor's blood! Sven's dad looks heavenwards. SVEN'S DAD You're not using the right technique. Sven's dad tries to take it over. SVEN No! I'm doing it! They start to struggle. SVEN (getting angry) You're always telling me... TELLING me! Erik tries to separate them. ERIK Sven! SVEN (to his dad) Let me do something for myself for a change! Suddenly Aud comes forward. AUD No! Don't quarrel! Sven and his dad stop fighting, surprised by the vehement in her voice. AUD We'll never get where we want to go if we fight. Aud crosses to the Horn and inserts the mouthpiece. Loki glances at Keitel. He hadn't bargained for this! LOKI Er... don't blow it! You never know WHAT might happen... AUD It has not spoken for a thousand years... You must bring it to life with a kiss... She puts her lips to the mouthpiece and just touches it with them... almost a kiss... then... very gently... she begins to blow... a soft... slight note can just be heard... Aud takes her mouth away from the mouthpiece... and the soft note goes on... reverberating... A sweet note... a magic note... the Vikings stand stock-still, enchanted by the sound... and the sound all the time is getting louder and the Horn begins to vibrate with the note. As the volume increases the GOLDEN DRAGON itself begins to reverberate with the sound. Rings of ripples begin to radiate out from the boat across the calm water. The note grows louder and louder, and the Vikings, who at first were laughing and cheering at Aud's success, begin to get rather alarmed. Louder and louder gets the note and the Horn shakes and the boat vibrates. Things start to be shaken loose, and fall onto the deck. Ropes uncoil and run loose. A heavy block suddenly crashes down to the deck, crowning Harald and laying him out flat. Louder and louder grows the note, and the Vikings have to stop their ears for the pain. The water around the ship becomes more and more agitated. And then another sound is heard. It is the thunder of water in the distance like a million distant waterfalls. And suddenly they notice the sea is running like a river - all in one direction... sweeping the ship forward with incredible momentum. In no time they are engulfed in a mist, still travelling at a rate of knots. Almost at once appointed rock looms out of the mist ahead of them. Erik flings himself at the steering oar, and everyone is thrown about as the ship veers wildly and just misses the rock, only to see another looming up ahead of them. The ship veers again, as a third rock looms ahead. This time Sven has grabbed a coil of rope, and as they pass the third rock, he throws it like a lasso over the rock. Loki and Keitel leap to grab the rope just as the rope goes taut and the ship comes to a lurching stop, anchored by the rope, but still swaying and buffeted in the racing waters. Those on board shout to each other, soaked to the skin. It is difficult to make out what they are shouting. LOKI Help! AUD What are you doing? LOKI What d'you think? Help! Somebody help us! SVEN Shut up! LOKI (pointing at Aud) She wants to kill us! KEITEL She wants to take us over the Edge of the World! AUD You want to get to Asgaard, don't you? LOKI How do we know this is the way? ERIK (shouting) We blew the Horn Resounding. LOKI (screaming and pointing an accusing finger at Aud) SHE blew the Horn Resounding. KEITEL (shouting) Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge! ERIK What are you talking about? LOKI (to Keitel) Shut up! KEITEL She knows it was our fault! LOKI Keep your mouth shut, Keitel! KEITEL No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you! Loki looks around desperately. LOKI You've lost your mind. KEITEL We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt! LOKI You fool! Suddenly Loki produces his stiletto and leaps onto Keitel, stabbing at him. LOKI I should have got rid of you long ago! KEITEL Like you got rid of Snorri! Erik tries to separate them. AUD No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us. ERIK That's right! For a split second Erik is distracted. He looks across at Aud and for a moment he sees Freya standing there. FREYA Once you are in the spell of the Horn, hatred will destroy you... Then it is Aud once more. But in that split second Loki has stabbed Erik. ERIK Arrgh! Erik staggers back clutching his arm. Keitel gives a roar of rage, and picks Loki up bodily and hurls him out of the boat into the maelstrom. The other Vikings look on aghast. Keitel turns on them KEITEL He killed Snorri! He caused the land of Hy-Brasil to sink! SHE knew! AUD I didn't know! KEITEL Now she wants to send us over the Edge of the World! AUD How else d'you think we're going to get to Asgaard? The Vikings look at each other amidst the roaring waters and the thick spray. Erik holds his bleeding arm and looks at Aud. Should he trust her or not? Suddenly he turns on the others. ERIK (shouting above the din) Do YOU know the way to Asgaard, Keitel Blacksmith? Keitel shakes his head. ERIK Do YOU know the way to Asgaard, Sven? Sven shakes his head. ERIK There is one road before us, and that leads over the Edge of the World. Harald sits up as he returns to consciousness. HARALD There IS no Edge of the World. Sven's dad bonks him again. Erik takes the rope and begins paying it out. With grim faces the Vikings turn and face towards the roaring of the waters, as Erik edge the ship further into the mist. The noise is deafening. It would be almost impossible to hear any voice above it. The faces of the Vikings betray their fear as they find themselves emerging from out of the mist at the Edge of the World. They gape as they find themselves confronted by a Waterfall of Seas - stretching on either side of them - as far as the eye can see - water falling and plunging over the lip of the world. And in front of them - the blue sky continues on down and down until it shades into blackness strewn with stars beneath their feet... Sven, Sven's dad and Keitel edge to the prow and gasp. AUD No! Don't look over the Edge! Erik lets out a little more rope, until the ship is protruding over the edge. Sven, his dad and Keitel peer over the side, and stare down into the abyss. They gasp. From above we see the prow of GOLDEN DRAGON and the backs of the Vikings' heads in plain view against a backdrop of stars below them. ERIK Let me see! Aud holds him back. AUD No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength. ERIK I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this! Erik turns to see Sven and Keitel trembling... They hold onto the sides of the ship but their legs can barely support them. SVEN There is nothing we can do... SVEN'S DAD Helpless... Keitel start to laugh. KEITEL Ha ha... I believed Loki... I believed I had a duty to blacksmiths! Ha ha ha! Keitel laughs a little hysterically. Aud turns urgently to Erik. AUD YOU still want to go to Asgaard? ERIK Of course. AUD Do you believe I love you? ERIK I... but I... AUD You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU? ERIK Yes - I believe you do. AUD Then let go! Erik hesitates, then he decides to believe in Aud. He throws the rope away. At once the ship shoots off over the Edge of the World into space... Everything seems to slow down, as the longship drops down and down... the ship twists slowly as it drops.... round and round. The Vikings gaze about them in wonder, as they find their ship if falling in silence amongst the stars. Harald comes to once again. HARALD I'm still seeing stars. Keitel looks round at him. KEITEL We're ALL seeing stars. HARALD No! I was hit on the head. The longship falls and falls through the star-strewn space until it softly lands in a white wilderness. On the deck the Vikings are huddles up, covered with rime-frost. It seems as if they have been lying there half-frozen for some time. Perhaps the entire adventure has all been a dream, and they have been stuck in the Arctic pack-ice the whole time. The hallucinations of men near to death. Aud tries to wake Erik. AUD Don't sleep... wake... Look! Erik opens his eyes and, for an instant, he sees Helga. He blinks and realizes it is Aud who is calling him back to consciousness. Suddenly coloured lights begin to play to his face. ERIK Bi-Frost... The Rainbow Bridge. Above them the Aurora Borealis stretches up, magnificent and awesome in the sky. Erik makes his way through the other Vikings. ERIK Wake up! The others slowly begin to rouse themselves from their icy slumber and sit up, awed by the sight. KEITEL (whispering) Are we dead? VIKINGS The Rainbow Bridge. They all peer up at the ever-changing colours of the Aurora Borealis, hanging in the sky above them like organ-pipes. But something is happening. The lights begin to fade to reveal a magical city on a mountain. The Vikings realize that this is journey's end.... they have reached Asgaard... the City of the Gods. The Vikings all catch their breaths and gaze in awe. ERIK Asgaard! HARALD MISSIONARY Where? SVEN'S DAD Up there, you fathead. HARALD MISSIONARY Up WHERE? Harald look round quizzically at the others. It is clear that he can see nothing. ERIK Look! It's real. Harald looks around at the others. HARALD Hallucinations are real. It's no use; Harald can see nothing. The Vikings, transfixed by the sight of their fabled home of the Gods, rise to their feet. Aud whispers to Erik. AUD The second note. ERIK The second not to wake the Gods... Erik kneels in front of the Horn. AUD Gently... Erik blows... a soft gentle note... He takes his mouth away, and smiles at Aud. Once again the Horn stars to vibrate and the note gets louder... the ship starts to vibrate... louder and louder... The whole landscape starts to vibrate... louder and louder grows the not until even the stars in the sky are vibrating and then a magical thing starts to happen... The note fades as one by one the shimmering stars start to fall out of the night sky... they fall like silver snow... until the ship... the Vikings... Asgaard... the whole landscape is covered in sparkling dust... then in the ensuing silence the first light begins to glow in the Halls of Asgaard... then another... and another... Erik stares as is bewitched and slowly begins to climb out of GOLDEN DRAGON.... but Aud tries to pull him back. AUD Erik! You've done what you came to do! ERIK Not quite... Aud looks at him. AUD Blow the third note! The note to take us home! ERIK There is something I must ask the Gods... AUD No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return. Erik looks at her... for a moment... But he knows he has no choice. SVEN I came to find my grandfather. ERIK I have to go... AUD Then I shall come too. ERIK (stares at her) No... no.. AUD I don'T want to live WITHOUT you. ERIK But, Aud... I... I came to find someone... Aud is about to say "Her?", but she bites the word back and looks down at the ground. ERIK I'm sorry, Aud... I really am. Aud kisses Erik, who then turns and climbs out of GOLDEN DRAGON and sets off across the ice. Sven follows. SVEN'S DAD Wait for me! I'll be dead soon anyway... KEITEL You can't go without me! They follow. Even Harald Missionary starts to follow. HARALD Where are they all going? AUD Aren't you afraid? HARALD Oh... There's nothing for ME to be afraid OF. Harald smiles and sets off after the others. Aud follows. The stars have fallen to form a shining, winding pathway up to the City of the Gods. This is what the Vikings head for. Between them and the Citadel strange huge forms rise up. The Vikings approach and find the vast skeletons of the slain giants. The Vikings are but tiny gnat-sized figures wending their way between the vast figures. They climb the stairway-path of stars, up the winding road and eventually fins themselves outside the massive doors of Asgaard. ERIK Valhalla... Sven turns on Harald. SVEN There! It's real! It's solid! Now do you believe us? He pats the wall of Valhalla - the Great Hall. Harald reaches out, but his hand goes right through the wall. HARALD There isn't anything. Harald Missionary walks straight through the wall and disappears from sight. The Vikings gasp, and run up to feel the point where he disappeared. The door is perfectly solid to them, and they jump pout of their skins as Harald suddenly reappears again. HARALD You're having me on, aren't you? ERIK It's Valhalla - where the warriors slain in battle go. AUD It doesn't exist for him. SVEN'S DAD He's just s cynic. At this moment there is a creak and the great doors mysteriously swing open. As if mesmerized, the Vikings enter the Halls of Asgaard. The door slams behind them. They spin round, but the doors have vanished... No man has ever entered the Halls of Asgaard and left alive... Erik slowly starts to cross the vast floor looking around him as he does so. One by one the other Vikings follow. After a while Erik stops. ERIK Listen! The Vikings listen. They hear the sound of children laughing and shouting. Erik and his men follow through the columns towards a pool of light. The scene that greets their eyes is not at all what they had been prepared for. Valhalla is not full of the warriors slain in battle, quaffing mead on the ale-bench and reliving old battles - it is, instead full of children romping, laughing, shouting, quarrelling and playing games... chess, fencing... dice... tag, etc., around a wide hearth fire. Women are cooking and doing other housewifely things... weaving, making bread, etc. It is a thoroughly domestic scene. Suddenly one of them turns at Erik. It is Helga, whom Erik accidentally killed in Scene One. She is once again kneading dough. She has a red stain under her breast. HELGA Oh good! It's Mr Wonderful! Erik leaps to her side. ERIK I've come to take you back to the land of the living. HELGA What a stupid idea. ERIK (mortally hurt) Why? HELGA What's the point of being dead in the land of the living? ERIK I'll ask the Gods to give you life again! Helga looks at Erik very sceptically. She obviously thinks he doesn't know what he's talking about. Aud reacts. Erik takes Helga's hand - and gets covered in dough. HELGA Have you tried to ask the God for anything? ERIK Well... no... HARALD MISSIONARY Who is he talking to? AUD Sh! HELGA Odin! One of the children, throwing pennies against the wall, looks round. CHILD ODIN I'm busy. The Vikings are recovering from their surprise. VIKINGS Odin? HELGA (getting back to her kneating) He's busy. ERIK Is THAT Odin? HELGA You'll have to wait till he's finished his game. ERIK (shouting across) Odin! Odin leaves his game and saunters towards Erik. ERIK We have come from the world of Midgard... The child whom Odin is playing with points his hammer at the ground near Erik and a lightning bolt zaps into it. Erik jumps. CHILD-THOR Clear off. ODIN No, wait, Thor. ERIK You must help us. ODIN We don't HAVE to help anybody. ERIK Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun - men fight and kill each other the whole time. ODIN Why should WE care? ERIK Because... you're... you're the Gods.... ODIN So? ERIK Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed. Harald looks around at the Vikings in increasing desperation. HARALD This is ridiculous. VIKINGS Sh! HARALD Right! The other Child-Gods have stopped playing around now and are watching Erik and Odin. ODIN Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other. ERIK But you're the Gods! ODIN Look... Erik... Odin whistles. The other children look over their shoulders. From out of the darkness of the perimeter of the Hall, shadows emerge... shadows that, as they shuffle and stumble into the light, reveal themselves to be the heroes that the Vikings had expected to find in Valhalla. But they are not hale and hearty giants quaffing mead and reliving their great battles... they are, in fact, a sorry lot... the slain-in-battle still bearing the hideous deformities of their fatal wounds. Most have a sword or an axe buried in some part of their anatomy. One has been cleft in twain... The Vikings react to this grisly gathering as more and more of them emerge from the shadows. They gasp as they notice Snorri, Ivar, Thorfinn, Loki and Leif the Lucky. ERIK Snorri! Ivar! HARALD Here we are standing on a bare mountain top talking to thin air. We notice that Harald's cloak is being blown about as if he were indeed on a bare mountain top. The other's cloaks are still. Sven's dad is gazing across at one horribly mutilated specimen. SVEN'S DAD Dad! KEITEL (disbelievingly) How can you tell? SVEN'S DAD I'll never forget him! The BASTARD! Sven reacts. Sven's dad starts to go berserk. SVEN'S DAD He drove me mad! SVEN Easy, Dad! SVEN'S DAD All his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"... SVEN Dad! SVEN'S DAD I hate you! I hate you! Sven's dad collapses against Sven and Sven comforts him, understandingly. A figure emerges from the throng of dead. It is Thorfinn. Sven looks up at him. THORFINN You won, Sven. LOKI What right have YOU to try and stop men fighting, Erik the Viking? There is glory in battle. There are riches to be made and won... KEITEL Made by YOU, Loki! LOKI By YOU - Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business... KEITEL It's not my business any more! Suddenly there is a howl... a bitter howl that echoes above and around the Halls of Asgaard and that gets more distant and more distant. Everyone (including the dead heroes and the Gods) freezes and looks up, listening. Perhaps we cut away to the boiling sky as it resolves itself into the shape of a wolf that snarls and slinks away. Odin turns to Erik as the howling recedes. ODIN Fenrir the Wolf has gone, Erik. But will men cease fighting each other? THAT is not in our power... Odin starts to laugh. All the other children start to laugh... so do the dead heroes. Erik and his men look round uneasily. ERIK I have one more request before we return... Erik turns towards Helga, who is still standing at her trough of dough with her arms up to her elbows in flour. Aud watches Erik with sadness in her heart. ODIN Return? You have set your foot in the Halls of Asgaard, Erik. You cannot return. Aud looks round to see how the others react. It is as she had feared. Erik pales. The blood drains from the other's faces. Aud whispers something to Harald. Harald looks at her blankly. AUD (whispering) PLEASE! HARALD But you're all imagining this... whatever it is. AUD (earnestly) You're the only one who can. PLEASE. Harald look around at the dumbfounded Vikings. Then he shrugs and wanders off, disappearing through the closed doors of Valhalla. ERIK You mean... we must stay here forever? As he says this Erik's eyes turn again towards Helga. He is clearly thinking at least there are compensations... Odin, however, is laughing again. ODIN Stay HERE? Ha ha! This is Valhalla. This is reserved for those slain-in-battle. HORRIBLY SLAIN WARRIOR (grinning cheerfully) Yeah! We're the LUCKY ones! A HORRIBLY SLAIN FRIEND OF HIS Yeah. It's much better than dying of old age. The ghastly and dismembered dead warriors all chortle no end at the dismay written on the face of Erik and his men. At the same time there is a grinding, winching sound. All those around the hearth-place fall back as a vast grating is winched up from out of the flames. The Vikings look at each other. ODIN For YOU there is only the Pit of Hel! As Odin says this there is a roaring sound and the flames and smoke are suddenly reversed and as the roaring increases the flames are sucked down altogether to reveal the black Pit of Hel itself. And now the Pit is sucking the Vikings into it... their hair blows... they try to withstand the force that is drawing them towards the abyss... The Gods look on in some amusement. But some of the dead are concerned. SVEN'S GRANDFATHER Son! My son! SVEN'S DAD Get lost! SVEN Dad! Grandfather! Sven tries to reconcile his father and grandfather, but it's no use. He is sucked towards the Pit. VIKINGS Help! ERIK (to Helga) I tried to save you! HELGA Why should you care? ERIK I don't know! I just did! Erik can no longer withstand the force that is sucking him down to the Pit of Hel. Suddenly, however, Snorri has leapt from the ranks of the dead. He grabs Erik and tries to stop him sliding towards the Pit of Hel. But it's no good. ERIK No! Let go, Snorri! SNORRI I've got you! ERIK You'll be sucked down too! SNORRI No! Arrgh! Meanwhile, Ivar and Thorfinn and Leif the Lucky have also leapt forward to save their comrades. They put up a fantastic struggle but remorselessly they are all sucked down. VIKINGS Aagh! The Vikings clutch at the stone floor, their fingers trace blood as they try to cling on... but to no avail. The first are already toppling into the Pit. VIKINGS Noooh! VIKINGS Ah! And the rest - including Aud - soon follow. The mouth of the Pit of Hel, through which the Vikings are now tumbling higgledy-piggledy, is a round white disc set in the unutterable blackness of the pit. However, as the Vikings free-fall slowly towards camera, they are lit up by a faint, reddish glow from below. They are staring, wild-eyed and screaming as they fall. As they fall, Erik manages to smash his axe into the side of the Pit. Thorfinn grabs his leg and holds onto Sven's foot. Leif clutches at Sven's belt. Sven's dad hangs onto Sven's foot. Ivar clutches Thorfinn's foot. Erik clutches Ivar's leg and Aud clutches Erik's. They dangle like this for some seconds, and look fearfully beneath them. Then they can see the Infernal Regions of flame and molten lava... somehow suggesting the face of a huge and sinister creature. No wonder they're scared out of their wits. Meanwhile, Odin and Thor appear at the top of the Pit and look down with mild amusement. Thor casually points his hammer and a streak of lightning zaps Erik's axe. It instantly glows red hot. Erik screams. Suddenly we hear a new sound - a long, high, sweet note. AUD Listen! LISTEN! The third note! But it's no good. Erik has to let go of the red-hot axe. Everyone screams as they start to plunge down towards the Pit of Hel. Cut to GOLDEN DRAGON. Harald Missionary is blowing the Horn Resounding. HARALD MISSIONARY (to himself) I want to go home... Oooh! Suddenly GOLDEN DRAGON, the Horn Resounding and Harald Missionary shoot up into the air and disappear from sight. Cut back to the Pit of Hel. The Vikings are looking down as they fall - they are still scared but gradually start laughing... laughing as they fall down and down and down until they fall out of sight. We are left with a blackness and just the white disc of the mouth of the Pit of Hel above, until the disc changes magically into the moon. There is a series of splashes. The note begins to fade and the camera slowly pans down to reveal the Vikings all fallen into the duck pond back at Ravensfjord. They are laughing and whooping and splashing each other. ERIK I don't believe it... Ha ha ha! It brought us HOME! LEIF But who BLEW it? IVAR Oh! Who cares? We're HOME! THORFINN Mum! Dad! SVEN We're back! Sven embraces his father and dances him around with joy. ALL Yo hoo! We're here! We're... Suddenly the joy drains from their faces and they each gape in horror. What is it they see? We cut to see that out of the huts the women and children and old men are emerging - but they are anything but happy. In fact they are all bound and gagged. Behind them emerge the sinister figures of Halfdan the Black, Gisli and maybe half a dozen armed men. Halfdan and his cronies no longer look sleek and self-assured. They are haggard and desperate. Their faces are streaked with dirt and sweat, and their clothes are torn and soiled. They have clearly been going through a lean time, since Ragnarok ended, and have descended on the village for revenge and for whatever plunder they can find. They have a few sackfuls of booty with them. They herd the women, children and old men into a pathetic huddle in the middle of the village. Halfdan is spitting evil and hatred. HALFDAN Throw down your weapons - or we shoot the children first. Erik hesitates... The others look at him. What choice have they? Reluctantly, Erik throws his weapons into the pond. The others follow suit. Halfdan watches. His men stand around him in a tight group with their backs to each other. HALFDAN Good... Good... Right, now we'll just shoot the children anyway... Erik is paralysed. What can they do? Half Halfdan's men are aiming their crossbows at Erik and his comrades, and half are aiming at the women and children. They raise the crossbows to shoot. Their fingers tighten on the triggers. Suddenly there is a scream from above. HARALD Look out below! Everyone looks up and, amazingly, out of the sky falls GOLDEN DRAGON and lands fair and square on top of Halfdan and his gang, squashing them flat. Harald Missionary staggers blearily from the wreckage. GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE Harald! She rushes to Harald, while the Vikings rush to release their loved ones. Great celebrations all round. IVAR Look! They all turn and see the sun rising. The villagers gasp in wonder. They've never seen the sun before. Erik looks around and sees Thorfinn and Sven with their arms round each other. Aud looks up as Erik smiles at he and holds her to him. Then they all turn and gaze at the spectacle of the sun returning to the world.

Scene #12, Interior, Day, Dining Room










1    ED - W


     Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun-
     tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of
     view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view
     allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the
     forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small
     shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth
     oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by
     this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.



2    ED - CAR


     Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of
     a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other
     peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be
     heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving
     away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-
     pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a
     dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.



3    ID - CAR


     Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY
     and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.
     Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear "Michigan State" T-shirts,
     and are students along with the others at that univer-
     sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up
     front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen
     to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the
     radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it
     were a drum.


                             SHELLY

               (Singing with the music)... Together,
               forever...


                             SCOTT

               Ash, where are we?


                             ASHLY

               I'll tell ya in a second. Now we're
               still on seventy-five just past the
               county border...



4    ED - W


     Once again, the camera takes the point of view of the
     dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge
     to peer downward. Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-
     mobile speeding along the narrow highway below.



5    ID - CAR


     ASHLY traces a route on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Which would put us...which would
               put us...


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ, just tell us already
               will ya?


     ASHLY zeroes in on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


     SCOTT is growing impatient.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


                             SCOTT

               Yes?


                             ASHLY

               Here!


     Suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks
     from SCOTT's hand.



6    ED - CAR


     The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane.
     A large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming
     races toward the car on a collision coarse.



7    ID - CAR


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, watch out!



8    ED - CAR


     The truck races closer.



9    ID - CAR


     Their steering wheel is locked.


                             ASHLY

               Turn!



10   ED - CAR


     At the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can
     be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its
     own lane.



11   ED - CAR


     The truck speeds harmlessly past them.



12   ID - CAR


                             ASHLY

               Damn it Scott, what the hell was that?
               You trying to kill us?


                             SCOTT

               Don't yell at me, it's your lousy
               steering wheel. The damn thing jerked
               right out of my hand.


                             ASHLY

               I can't understand it. I just had
               this thing in for a tune-up.


                             SHELLY

               Radio's dead too, ace.


                             ASHLY

               And I just had 'em tune up the whole
               thing yesterday.


                             SCOTT

               Well, then take it back 'cause the
               damn thing don't work. Only thing
               that works on the whole car is the
               lousy horn.


     SCOTT honks the horn.



13   ED - CAR


     Several local MEN walking down the highway respond to
     the horn by waving.



14   ID - CAR


     SCOTT yells out the window at them.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, go to hell, I'm not waving at ya!


     He looks in the rear view mirror. The MEN are still wav-
     ing in the distance. SCOTT turns back to drive.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     SHELLY turns around in the front seat and holds up a
     pint of Scotch.


                             SHELLY

               Well, I'd like to make a toast. To
               Scott who almost killed us.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, eat shit and die will ya?


     SHELLY and the others laugh.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, okay- then to a wild week-end
               in a wonderful cabin with good friends,
               (She glances at SCOTT) provided we
               live that long.


     SHELLY cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle
     back to ASHLY and LINDA. ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the
     bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks.


                         ASHLY and LINDA

               ...With good friends.


     They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY
     tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of
     LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes
     the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite "No,
     thank you," then back up front to SCOTT.


                             LINDA

               Hey Scotty, what's this place like
               anyway?


                             SCOTT

               Well, the guy that's renting it says
               it's an old place, little run down,
               but it's right up in the mountains-
               totally secluded. (He takes a drink
               from the bottle) Best part is, we
               get it so cheap.


                             LINDA

               Why are we getting it so cheap?


                             SCOTT

               I don't know, might be in real bad
               shape.


                             CHERYL

               You mean nobody's seen this place
               yet?


                             SCOTT

               Not yet.


                             ASHLY

               Might not be too bad.


                             LINDA

               No...


                             ASHLY

               Actually, it might be very nice.


                             LINDA

               Yeah...


                             SHELLY

               It's probably a real pit.


                             CHERYL

               I can't believe that we're renting
               a place for a week-end that nobody's
               seen.


                             SCOTT

               (Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ,
               not this again...


                             CHERYL

               (Turning to ASHLY) You know, mom and
               dad would never let us go up to a place
               like this if they knew-


                             ASHLY

               -Which is exactly why they don't know.
               I'll tell you who I am gonna call.
               The guys that fixed up this car.



15   ED - CAR


     The car approaches an exit along the highway.



16   ID - CAR


     ASHLY glances at the map again.


                             ASHLY

               Hey, I think this is where we get
               off.



17   ED - CAR


     The car turns off the main highway and follows several
     back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that
     winds upward along a twin set of mountains.



18   ID - CAR


     SCOTT glances up to the peaks.


                             SCOTT

               These mountains seem familiar.


                             LINDA

               What do they remind you of? Some-
               thing majestic? Adventure?


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, more like adventure.


                             LINDA

               Any adventure in particular?


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's sweater.


     ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud. LINDA laughs quietly,
     and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself.


                             SHELLY

               (Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it
               Scotty, when you least expect it,
               you're gonna get it good.



19   ED - B


     Finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending
     over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses.



20   ED - CAB


     It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their
     destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by
     thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-
     ues to sputter and backfire.



21   ID - CAR


     ASHLY reacts to his car.


                             ASHLY

               I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up.
               but I'm just not paying for it.


                             LINDA

               This place is perfect.


                             CHERYL

               The woods come awfully close to the
               house don't they?


                             SCOTT

               So what's wrong with the woods, they
               can't bite ya.


                             CHERYL

               It's just a little claustrophobic
               that's all.


                             LINDA

               Well, I think it's beautiful.


                             SHELLY

               Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-
               end.



22   ED - CAB


     SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds
     a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the
     door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others.


                             SCOTT

               It's supposed to be one of these on
               here.


     After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.



23   ID - M.R.


     The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT
     opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway
     for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.
     The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings
     made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,
     and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set
     into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently
     in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door
     in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed
     containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon
     the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap
     door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, this place has a dungeon.


     CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over
     to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing
     the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring
     to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Put these back will you?


     SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the
     hatch but cannot.


                             SCOTT

               They nailed it shut.


                             CHERYL

               Good, I don't like cellars. Probably
               just some garbage down there anyways.


                             SCOTT

               Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in
               cellars. I mean it's not going to
               try and get out or anything.


                             CHERYL

               Well, what's down there?


                             SCOTT

               Well, could be any number of things.
               Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead
               bodies-


                             LINDA

               Hey, look at this!


     LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand-
     father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it
     begins to tick.


                             LINDA

               Ta daaaaaa!


     The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.



24   ET - CAB


     The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.



25   IT - M.R.


     CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She
     is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the
     ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil
     and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-
     ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-
     ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can
     see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-
     mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the
     room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale
     white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.
     She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some
     unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch
     a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open
     window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the
     drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now
     retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale
     cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks
     up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some
     form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.
     She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping
     of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns
     to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-
     sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.
     Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from
     the cellar.



26   IT - K/M.R.


     ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-
     ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between
     her and the trap door.


                             ASHLY

               What're you drawing Cheryl?


     He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his
     shoulder to glance at it.


                             CHERYL

               I...I don't know.


                             ASHLY

               Is it a bible?


                             CHERYL

               No, no it's no bible. (She glances
               again at the cellar, knowing some-
               thing is down there) I don't know
               what it is.


                             LINDA

               Well, this one of the clock's not
               bad.


     LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock
     with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to
     the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She
     is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL
     wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front
     of her to speak secretly.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) I got it right here.


     He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking
     past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's
     feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.
     LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, this is really good. I like
               how you did the numbers in that wood-
               ish style.


     ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it
     quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on
     a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She
     is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although
     nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with
     it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response.


                             ASHLY

               (Still in a whisper) I knew you'd
               like it.


     Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his
     lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-
     rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back
     on CHERYL's small drawing table.


                             LINDA

               It's really good Cheryl. Very close
               to the origional.


                             CHERYL

               (In a relieved whisper) Yes, very
               close.


                             LINDA

               I'm gonna check dinner.


     LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.


                             ASHLY

               You better get washed up. I'll see
               ya in there.


     He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL
     again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of
     view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-
     ing...waiting.



27   IT - K


     A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.
     SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.



28   IT - D.R.


     She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner
     table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA
     and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (In a whisper) Dead bodies in the
               cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...


                             CHERYL

               Will you stop it?


                             LINDA

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


     SCOTT turns toward LINDA.


                             SCOTT

               Will you relax, I'm just kidding
               around. She can take a joke-


     He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He
     turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in
     his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,
     then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (Jokingly) I'll get ya.


     With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.


                             SCOTT

               I'll get ya for this Cheryl.


     ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.


                             ASHLY

               I'd like to make a toast for all
               here this evening. As a greek friend
               of mine once said, "Nis-hat-nis-fert-
               dis-ruben-tu-tar-im."


                             LINDA

               Which means?


                             SCOTT

               Party down!


     The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of
     wood heard from the main room.


                             SCOTT

               What the hell...


     All stand from the table and hurry to the main room.



29   IN - M.R.


     The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped
     out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open.
     They stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to
     what could have done this. CHERYL is slighly more nervous
     than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak.


                             ASHLY

               (Slowly) What is this?


                             SCOTT

               Whatever it is, it's still down there.


                             CHERYL

               I don't like cellars, let's close it
               up. (She does not want to deal with
               it) It's probably just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-
               that's the stupidest thing I ever
               heard in my life. Jesus Christ.


     SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He
     traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.


                             LINDA

               Maybe it is just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, probably right. It's probably
               just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why
               don't you make sure.


     He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it
     back.


                             CHERYL

               Scotty, I'm not going down there!


                             SCOTT

               Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.


                             LINDA

               Scotty don't. You're crazy if you
               go down there. Why don't you wait
               until morning.


                             SCOTT

               Look, I'll be all right.


                             SHELLY

               What melodrama! What courage! A kiss
               my brave hero.


     SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends
     the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.


                             SHELLY

               I, your virgin queen eagerly await
               the precious moment when you will
               ascend.


                             SCOTT

               Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     He disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and
     ASHLY wait above.


                             ASHLY

               (Calling down) Hey Scott, see any-
               thing?


     There is no answer.


                             ASHLY

               Hey Scott!...Scott!


                             SHELLY

               He's just kidding around.


     There is silence.


                             SHELLY

               Isn't he?


     No sounds come from the cellar.


                             ASHLY

               Linda, get me a flashlight.


                             LINDA
               That's the only one we brought up.


     ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle.


                             ASHLY

               Then get that lantern.


     LINDA brings it over. ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,
     lights the wick, and descends into the basement.



30   IN - C


     Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls
     and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In
     front of him stands an old door which leads to another
     section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.
     Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with
     a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into
     the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the
     cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow
     pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his
     light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.


                             ASHLY

               Scott?


     ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from
     the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into
     a pair of arms which grab him.


                             ASHLY

               Ahhhhhhh!


     It is only SCOTT behind him.


                             ASHLY

               What the hell are you doing down
               here, jerkin' off? How come you
               didn't answer me?


                             SCOTT

               When?


                             ASHLY

               Just now, I mean upstairs.


                             SCOTT

               I didn't hear you.


                             ASHLY

               Oh well, did you find anything?


                             SCOTT

               Uh-uh.


                             ASHLY

               What's this?


     SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals
     several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,
     he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort
     of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the
     cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover
     a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and
     other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.



31   EN - CAB


     It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.



32   IN - M.R.


     The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking
     quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed
     around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once
     this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man
     is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking.


                             ASHLY

               Shhh, listen to this.


                             VOICE

               My name is Julian Knowby. I am a pro-
               fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology
               in Dextin university's ancient history
               department...


                             ASHLY

               This is the tape I found downstairs.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...I am recording this
               entry from a small cabin in the south-
               ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am
               staying with my wife for a few weeks
               so that I may continue my research un-
               disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc-
               iate professors and myself have been
               excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I
               believe I have made an important find
               in that area, and thus the reason for
               this log. With it, I can keep an ac-
               curate record of translations from
               my latest find; the first of six, the
               others still lost, volumes of ancient
               Sumarian burial practices and rites.
               Basically, it is a book of do's and
               don'ts dealing with the deceased en-
               titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans-
               lated "Book Of The Dead." It is bound
               in human flesh, and inked with blood
               of the deceased...


                             SCOTT

               Jeez, I'd hate to find out what they
               used for pens.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...This particular volume
               deals with demons and demon resurrect-
               ion. These are of the Katardi family,
               meaning those forces believed to inhab-
               it the jungles and woods of man's do-
               main. The first few pages that I have
               translated warn that these demons are
               dangerous, everpresent, and exist
               primarily through this book. As legend
               has it, only the sacred high priests
               of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess
               these books, for they alone could
               properly control the resurrected de-
               mons. It is only through the act of
               reciting the resurrection passage
               that these demons would be able to
               posess the living. For many years, it
               was thought that this legend-


     CHERYL turns off the machine at this point.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, what'd you do that for? It was
               just getting good.


                             CHERYL

               I just don't want to hear any more
               that's all.


                             SCOTT

               (Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's
               scared.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     He moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for
     a bit then stops.


                             SCOTT

               She's acting like a baby- it's no
               big deal.


     He turns the machine on. The passage continues.

     A section of ground deep within the woods begins to crack,

               (Louder now) Shut it off.


     ASHLY, hearing her for the first time, turns from the
     window to CHERYL. She is overwhealmed with fear.


                             VOICE

               Kanda!

     A bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder

     CHERYL can no longer control herself. She screams and
     covers her ears.


                             CHERYL

               Shut it offffff!


     The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree
     tears through it. ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and
     turns it off. CHERYL is crying now, and runs to her room.
     ASHLY turns to SCOTT.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, you knew not to play it, I
               mean...I mean you knew it was upset-
               ting her. You just don't know when
               you're carrying something too far.


                             SCOTT

               (To SHELLY) C'mon. (Back to ASHLY)
               Big deal, it's just a joke, shit.


     SCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom. SCOTT mumbles
     to himself along the way.


                             SCOTT

               You'd think she's three years old or
               something.


     SCOTT slams the door behind him. ASHLY sighs. He moves
     to the broken window and reaches through it to close
     the outside shutters.


                             LINDA

               He's really been bothering you hasn't
               he?


     ASHLY walks to a chair near the other window.


                             ASHLY

               No. It's not Scott. Scotty's okay.
               It's just that ever since we came
               up here, things have been a little
               too tense. (He sits) All these crazy
               things going on. And look at that
               window- we're gonna have to pay for
               that window now.


                             LINDA

               It'll be better tomorrow. Things'll
               smooth out, you'll see.


                             ASHLY

               I hope so.


     He looks at LINDA lovingly for a long moment.


                             ASHLY

               What'ya say we stay up for a while
               and listen to the storm.


                             LINDA

               Deal. Lemme check on Cheryl. I'll be
               right back.


     From across the room, she is seen opening CHERYL's door
     a crack. LINDA asks if she is all right, and gets a
     muffled reply. In the foreground, ASHLY removes the
     small box he showed to CHERYL earlier and places it in
     his hand. He glances behind to LINDA. She closes CHERYL's
     door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the
     box in his hand. She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens
     his eyes to watch. LINDA looks at him, but his eyes are
     closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. LINDA
     turns her attention back to the box. ASHLY watches again
     wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand. Quickly,
     LINDA turns to him but as expected, ASHLY is sleeping
     like a baby. She begins to turn back toward the box
     and ASHLY opens his eyes, but LINDA turns back again
     in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.


                             LINDA

               Ah ha!


                             ASHLY

               (Laughing) Stealing from the blind
               eh? It's for you.


     LINDA begins to open the box.


                             LINDA

               It better be good.


     The gold necklace is revealed inside.


                             LINDA

               Oh Ash, it's beautiful.


     LINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box
     and holds it around her neck.


                             ASHLY

               (Fastening it around her neck) I was
               going to give it to you before we
               left, but things got so hectic, this
               is the first chance I've had. Do you
               like it?


     LINDA moves to a mirror.


                             LINDA

               It's beautiful. I really love it.
               (She turns to ASHLY) I'll never take
               it off.

     Lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the
     small cottage. Through the outside window, ASHLY and
     LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them
     moves around the house to another window. The silhouette
     of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force
     continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside,
     she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a
     moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window.
     She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks
     at it, then out to the dark woods.



44   IN - C.B.


     CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the
     same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A
     noise almost like that of something breathing.



45   EN - CAB


     The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL
     walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be
     seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind
     shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering
     about.


                             CHERYL

               (Calling to the woods) Is anybody
               out there?


     There is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage
     toward the woods.



46   EN - W


     The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive.
     CHERYL stops.


                             CHERYL

               I know someone's out there...I
               heard you...I heard you in the cellar.


     Suddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms
     around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening.
     There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind
     blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest
     a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can
     be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows
     somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of
     something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth
     again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin
     when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty
     yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.
     Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She
     turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,
     leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then,
     all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry
     of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap
     around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches
     near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now
     moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to
     break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges
     from the woods and into the clearing. The force is
     still following.



47   EN - CAB


     CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked. She
     begins pounding upon the door.


                             CHERYL

               Help, help, let me in. Open the door!


     The evil entity now emerges from the woods.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly! Linda! Open up!


     CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where
     SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran-
     tically jams one key after another into the lock, but
     still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer
     with each key.


                             CHERYL

               Please, someone please! Help me, help
               meeeee!


     The evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are
     so frantic that the ring falls to the ground. She bends
     down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is
     SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She
     pushes him in the door and slams it tightly.



48   IN - M.R.


                             SCOTT

                             CHERYL

               (In hysterics) It...it tried to kill
               me. I, I heard a noise and...and I
               ran and the trees...the trees!


                             SCOTT

               What are you-


     He is cut off by ASHLY approaching with the others.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl what's wrong with you? Did
               something in the woods do this to
               you?


                             CHERYL

               No, no, no...the woods themselves-
               The trees- they're alive...


     She hugs ASHLY tightly and cries in hysterical sobs.


                             CHERYL

               They're alive...


                             LINDA

               Ash, why don't I take her into the
               bedroom so she can lie down a little-


                             CHERYL

               (Cutting her off) -I'm not lying
               down! I'm not staying here. We're
               leaving this place, we're leaving
               this place right now!


                             SCOTT

               Wait a minute, I'm sure as hell not
               going anywhere.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl-


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
               Trees do not attack people.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly, will you drive me into town
               or not?


                             ASHLY

               (Looking at his watch) Right Now?
               (He realizes how desperate she is)
               Sure, sure I'll drive you into town.
               But if you'll just listen to what
               you're saying, you-


                             CHERYL

               I don't care how it sounds. I want
               to leave this minute. You can bring
               back my things when you go.


                             ASHLY

               Okay- if you don't want to stay, I
               can't make you.


     LINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to
     the door.

     ASHLY and CHERYL move to the car. ASHLY helps CHERYL in

               I'll stay some place in town tonight.


     ASHLY tries to start the car. There is no response.
     CHERYL becomes somewhat worried. ASHLY tries again.
     The car will not turn over. A look of dread comes
     across CHERYL's face.



51   EN - CAB


     SCOTT and the others join the two outside.



52   IN - CAR


                             CHERYL

               It's not gonna start.


     ASHLY again tries the engine.


                             CHERYL

               I know it's not gonna start. It's
               not gonna let us leave.


     ASHLY keys the engine and it turns over this time, start-
     ing up with a roar. ASHLY, worried by CHERYL's condition
     glances over to her. Confused and upset, CHERYL turns
     away from ASHLY and looks out her window. They drive off
     into the night through the wooded mountains toward town.
     ASHLY glances at CHERYL who is studying the forest in-
     tensely for any sign of movement. The concern for his
     sister is made obvious by the expression on his face.
     Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows
     down.


                             CHERYL

               Why are you slowing down?


     ASHLY brings the car to a halt.


                             CHERYL

               What is this?


     ASHLY's gaze is fixed directly ahead, and his mouth opens
     slowly. He flips on the high beams which stab through the
     evening mist.

     The bridge over the chasm has been torn away. CHERYL is
     silent as ASHLY walks to the ravine's edge to examine
     any remains.

               no...it's not going to let us leave,
               it's not going to let us go...it's

     An axe is raised into the air, then brought down smash-
     ing upon a log, splitting it in two. SCOTT is chopping
     wood outside the cabin. Behind him, through a window,
     CHERYL sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him.
     SCOTT sets his axe down, gathers the wood and moves
     away. CHERYL shifts her gaze from SCOTT to the woods
     beyond. The camera moves in toward CHERYL then past
     her to SHELLY and LINDA who can be seen playing cards
     on the floor. ASHLY is seated near the fireplace with
     the tape recorder in front of him. He plugs an earphone
     in so only he can hear it. SCOTT enters the cabin and
     passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side
     of the fireplace. He throws a log in, and heads back
     outside.



56   IN - M.R.


     From inside, LINDA speaks.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, wanna play some cards?


                             CHERYL

               (Turning with a smile) Uh-uh.


     CHERYL turns to face the window again.


                             LINDA

               Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find
               some way around that cliff into town
               okay?


                             CHERYL

               Okay.


     Outside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights
     fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with
     the ear plug.


                             VOICE

               March 12th. Suzanne came after me
               and almost murdered me. My own wife.
               At first I thought it was a mental
               or physical disorder because of what
               had happened to her eyes, but I was
               only fooling myself. I knew what it
               was.


     Outside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather
     wood. SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds
     up one in particular.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, guess this card.


                             LINDA

               How am I going to know what card
               that is?


                             SHELLY

               Guess, I'm going to see if you're
               psychic.


     The card is a two of clubs.


                             LINDA

               Okaaaay...is it a queen?


                             SHELLY

               Right!


                             LINDA

               Really?


                             SHELLY

               Yeah.


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, I guessed the card right.


                             ASHLY

               (indifferently) Truly amazing Linda.


     He is listening intently to the log as it continues.


                             VOICE

               Three days have passed since that
               thing has been down there. I was hop-
               ing to weaken it without food or
               water. Nothing worked. Finally, in
               desperation I dragged her out to the
               shed and dismembered her so that what-
               ever it was could not get up again.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl, did you see that?


     CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the
     window.


                             SHELLY

               Try this one.


     She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.


                             LINDA

               Okay, lemme think, uh...


     She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-
     ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.


                             LINDA

               ...Um, it's a seven.


                             SHELLY

               Oh my God, what suit?


                             LINDA

               Diamonds, no wait! I mean hearts!


                             SHELLY

               That's right- seven of hearts!


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, did you see that? I guessed
               two cards in a row.


                             ASHLY

               (Still not paying attention) How do
               you do it Linda?


     He is concentrating on the tape.


                             VOICE

               This is when I saw the dark figures
               moving about in the woods. I should
               have never tampered with the "Book
               Of The Dead." I now know that what-
               ever it is I have resurrected through
               this book, is coming for me.


                             LINDA

               You know, I always thought I had
               some sort of extra sense. You know,
               like e.s.p or something.


                             SHELLY

               What's this one?


     She holds up the queen of spades.


                             LINDA

               Another seven!


                             SHELLY

               I don't believe it!


                             CHERYL

               (Still looking outside) Queen of
               spades.


     SHELLY looks at her card then back to CHERYL. She holds
     up another card.


                             CHERYL

               Four of hearts.


     The card is a four of hearts. SHELLY bites her lip in
     fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen
     in silence.


                             CHERYL

               Eight of spades.


     SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again.


                             CHERYL

               Two of spades- jack of diamonds-
               jack of clubs-


     Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY
     can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward
     the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of
     cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor.
     CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about
     like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un-
     like her own.


                             CHERYL

               Why have you disturbed our sleep,
               awakened us from our ancient slum-
               ber? You will die. Like the others
               before you. We will take you one by
               one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the
     floor.


                             ASHLY

               Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here!


     SHELLY does not respond.


                             ASHLY

               Hurry!


     She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL
     and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but
     behind her, she reaches for a pen.


                             LINDA

               Did you see her eyes? I'm scared.
               What's wrong with her?


     ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter.


                             SCOTT

               What happened to her?


     CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly.


                             LINDA

               Look at her eyes.


     SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them,
     but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward,
     then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon.
     LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied
     pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping
     her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining
     arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin
     floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting
     him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book-
     case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight.
     SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward
     ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull
     himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when
     SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses
     him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to
     his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above
     ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the
     jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA
     and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She
     begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut
     upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push
     the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top
     and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the
     butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented
     screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand
     is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the
     chain across the hatch.



57   IN - LB


     Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping.
     ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks
     to the door, closing it quietly behind him.



58   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in
     the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and
     laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's
     breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her
     breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.


                             SCOTT

               She'll be okay Ash, she just took a
               bad bump.


                             ASHLY

               (Quietly) Yeah.


     SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below
     as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond.


                             ASHLY

               We've still got a few hours before
               morning.


                             SHELLY

               I don't know if I can wait that
               long.


                             SCOTT

               You have to. We all have to. Then,
               once it's light out, we'll try to
               find a way to get around that chasm.


                             SHELLY

               (Covering her ears) Why does she keep
               making those horrible noises?


                             ASHLY

               I don't know.


                             SHELLY

               And what about her eyes?


     ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet.


                             SHELLY

               What about her eyes? (Desperately)
               For God's sake what happened to
               her eyes?!


     CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a
     streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the
     trap door. Her head is slightly tilted as she watches
     and listens to what is said above. From her point of
     view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be all right.


     CHERYL's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow
     liquid drools out between her teeth. She grins.



59   EN - CAB


     Outside, the forest is very dark. The unseen force moves
     from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs
     as it advances. The cottage comes into view and the evil
     entity glides up to it. The figure of a girl in the cabin
     window can be seen looking out. The force stops and moves
     behind a bush.



60   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SHELLY is studying the woods.


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, I...I think there's some-
               thing out there.


     SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out.



61   EN - CAB


     From within the woods, this force watches SCOTT peer out,
     but he can see nothing. Through the window he says some-
     thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away.



62   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence.


                             SCOTT

               ...Is to get some rest. Ash and I
               can stay up with Cheryl.


                             SHELLY

               Okay.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be okay. Come
               morning- you'll see.


     SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the
     fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with
     the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY
     glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock.
     It stands silent.



63   EN - CAB


     Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees
     SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another.
     She begins to undress near the window. The force now
     moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous
     speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window.
     She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream
     stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.



64   IN - M.R.


     A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the
     small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places
     the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly, are you okay?


     She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns
     to ASHLY.


                             SCOTT

               Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute.



65   IN - S.B.


     SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing
     amidst the shadows.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows
     upon the curtains.



66   IN - S. BATH


     SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the
     shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT
     turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the
     doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT.
     Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's
     face and clothes with her nails.



67   IN - S.B.


     Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY
     still upon him biting at his throat.



68   IN - M.R.


     They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to
     knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace. She
     remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot
     coals. SCOTT rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her
     out. SHELLY's face and hair on one side of her head are
     seared and blackened. She blinks her eyes open, turns
     her charred head to SCOTT, and speaks in a rasp.


                             SHELLY

               Thank you. I don't know what I would
               have done if I had remained on the hot
               coals burning my pretty flesh. You
               have pretty skin- give it to us!


     Cackling, SHELLY clutches SCOTT's neck and begins throttl-
     ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip. He tries
     to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with
     a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-
     ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from
     SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up
     the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat
     with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.
     ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT
     grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings
     his camping knife from its side sheath and slices
     deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.
     A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits
     an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's
     throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches
     terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling
     hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and
     bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor
     with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now
     almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the
     dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming
     the blade into her spine.

     SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the
     old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all
     at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her
     remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife
     protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours
     from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY
     stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.
     Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes
     about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-
     ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to
     his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg.


                             SCOTT

               Ahhhhhhh!


     Some force reanimates her, even though the body is
     dead.


                             ASHLY

               No...no...no...


                             SCOTT

               Hit her!


     SHELLY's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet,
     and laughing madly.


                             SCOTT

               Hit it!


     SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands
     with the axe, paralyzed. Gurgling black ooze, SHELLY
     advances toward them with one remaining arm. SCOTT
     grabs the axe from ASHLY, pushes him away and slams
     it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and
     CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe
     down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the
     final chop, there is silence.

     SHELLY's body remains on the floor for quite some time-
     until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and
     something must be done.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...Scott.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah.


                             ASHLY

               What is uh...what are we gonna do?


                             SCOTT

               Bury her.


                             ASHLY

               You...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend
               of ours isn't she?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, she's dead.


     ASHLY moves away from SCOTT.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's dead. We're gonna bury
               her now.


     ASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly.



69   EN - CAB


     Finally, the body is dragged outside and buried near
     the work shed. Harsh floodlights from the house make the
     task look very stark and barren.



70   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's
     room to check in on her.

     He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully.



72   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY quietly returns to the main room. SCOTT is load-
     ing new batteries into a flashlight.


                             SCOTT

               I saw an old hiking trail when we
               were driving up here. Now I don't
               know if it goes all the way around
               that gorge-


                             ASHLY

               -Or if it's even still in tact.


                             SCOTT

               Or if it's even still in tact. But
               uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good
               care of Linda.


                             ASHLY

               I will. Do you have everything?


                             SCOTT

               (Putting on a small back pack) Yeah-
               all set.


                             ASHLY

               Listen...Scotty...I'm sorry about
               falling apart like that when-


                             SCOTT

               Don't bother, really.


     He steps out the door.


                             SCOTT

               If I find a way out of here, I'll
               mark it and then come back. Then if
               I'm not back here in a few hours...
               if for some reason...well, if I don't
               come back, grab Linda, leg and all,
               and just get her the hell out of here.


     They shake hands.


                             ASHLY

               You're a good man.


                             SCOTT

               Good, I'm the best.



73   EN - CAB


     ASHLY smiles a good-bye to SCOTT and watches him move
     off into the night. He lingers for a moment by SHELLY's
     grave, then slowly disappears into the woods.



74   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY closes the door and turns back to the main room.
     He sees CHERYL's eyes through the crack in the cellar.
     She has been watching all of this through a space be-
     tween the trap door and floor. ASHLY walks past her to
     LINDA's room.



75   IN - L.B.


     He opens the door and a crack of light falls across her.
     LINDA wakes up.


                             LINDA

               Who's there? Ash?


                             ASHLY

               It's me Linda.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I had a bad dream about Linda.


                             ASHLY

               You did baby?


                             LINDA

               Yeah. She's all right isn't she?


                             ASHLY

               Yeah. Fine.


                             LINDA

               Is Shelly okay too Ash?


     ASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. He speaks
     in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, sure. She's sleeping that's
               all.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I love you. (She turns over)


                             ASHLY

               Get some rest.


     ASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few
     hours ago engulfs him once more.



76   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his
     tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks.


                             CHERYL

               You lied to her. You lied to Linda.
               Shelly's not sleeping. She's dead.
               Don't you know the difference? You
               killed her. You and Scott cut her up
               with the axe. She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha-
               ha-ha-


     ASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap
     door. CHERYL is silent from below for a moment, then
     the hatch opens an inch or so. (The length of the chain
     securing it) CHEYL's white eyes can be seen again.


                             CHERYL

               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY takes the axe and steps outside.



77   EN - CAB


     He begins to chop wood, taking out his emotions upon
     the logs with each blow. SHELLY's blood can still be
     seen on the blade of the axe.



78   IN - M.R.


     From her dungeon, CHERYL watches ASHLY chop wood in the
     window. The shadow of his axe rising then striking is
     seen over her white eyes.



79   EN - CAB


     Exhausted, ASHLY puts down the axe. He looks off into
     the woods but there is no sign of SCOTT. He returns to
     the cabin.



80   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL begins her taunting again.


                             CHERYL

               Soon all of you will be like me and
               then who will lock you in the cellar?
               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     CHERYL begins to violently ram her fists against the trap
     door. ASHLY walks by her to LINDA's room.



81   IN - L.B.


     She is still asleep. Quietly, so as not to wake her, ASHLY
     pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg. He re-
     moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. As he does
     this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-
     credible speed. ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still
     sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with
     white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. She lets
     out a low growl.



82   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through
     the front door. He steps outside and stops to look back
     in. He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to
     see in LINDA's room, being lost in the shadows. Something
     ragged and bloody grabs him. It is SCOTT's mutilated
     body ripped and torn to shreds. He is still alive. ASHLY
     looks behind him through the door to LINDA's room. He
     can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching
     him with glaring white eyes. ASHLY helps SCOTT to the
     couch so he can sit. SCOTT is in agony and can barely
     speak.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I think I'm dying. Jesus, I
               can't feel my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...uh Scotty you're gonna be okay.
               You're gonna be just fine- you'll see.


     He throws another log on the fire.


                             ASHLY

               You'll see.


     He looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone.
     She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where
     ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor-
     rible rasping sounds.

                             SCOTT

               It's, it's not gonna let us leave...
               Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're
               all gonna die here...


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die!


                             SCOTT

               ...All gonna die. All of us.


     ASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently.


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die! We're not gonna
               die! We're getting out of here! Now
               listen to me- is there a way around
               the chasm.


     SCOTT passes out.


                             ASHLY

               Scotty. Scott!


     ASHLY slaps SCOTT. He stirs awake and mumbles.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Ash. I don't want to die. So...
               so lonely to die like this. You're not
               gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash?


                             CHERYL

               (Imitating SCOTT) I don't want to
               die. So lonely to die like this. You're
               not gonna leave me are you? Are you
               Ash? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


                             ASHLY

               Scott, is there some way around the
               chasm?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I'm scared- I...I can't feel
               my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, listen to me please, for
               God's sake. Is there a way around
               the chasm?


                             SCOTT

               There is...one way, the trail...but
               the trees, they know...don't you see-
               they're alive!! They're ali-ahhhhhhh!


     His sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain.
     Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over
     grabbing his stomach. LINDA begins to laugh. ASHLY looks
     to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.


                             ASHLY

               Shut up!


     She continues to laugh. CHERYL in the cellar joins in
     the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but
     she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on
     the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety
     and places the barrels against LINDA's head.


                             ASHLY

               God forgive me Linda.


     The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. It
     is LINDA again. ASHLY puts down the rifle.


                             LINDA

               Ash, oh Ash, help Me! Please.


     She hugs him tightly.


                             LINDA

               Don't let them take me away again,
               please, please, please.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and holding her tightly) I
               won't, I won't- I promise.


     CHERYL's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly? Ashly, help me. Let me out
               of here. I'm all right now.


     ASHLY releases LINDA and moves cautiously to the cellar.
     LINDA remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace.


                             CHERYL

               I'm all right now, Ashly. I'm all
               right. Come unlock this chain and
               let me out.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     There is no reply from the cellar. ASHLY looks through
     the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the
     chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something
     wrong, he stops.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight-
     est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards
     and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand
     reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly
     it withdraws beneath the floor.


                             CHERYL

               (A little too sweet) Ash, what are you
               doing? This is your sister Cheryl. Don't
               you recognize me?


     Her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from
     the celler.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and yelling to the cellar)
               You bastards! Why are you doing this?
               Why?


     There is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him
     begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more,
     and she laughs at ASHLY.


                             ASHLY

               Oh...Linda.


     With newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by
     the legs and drags her outside.



83   EN - CAB


                             LINDA

               It's useless, useless, useless. In
               time we'll come for him, then you
               ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin,
     closing the door behind him.



84   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT is coughing again.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, Ash, please...I don't want to
               die- but...but I can't stand this
               pain. It hurts Ash. Gimme something.
               Gimme something to put me out.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, I can't. I- I know it's bad.
               But I can't be alone now, I can't.
               I'd lose my mind.


                             SCOTT

               Please Ash, please.


                             ASHLY

               You'll get better- you'll see.


     LINDA's laughter is faintly heard outside. ASHLY moves
     to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no
     longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-
     ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be
               better and we'll both get out of
               here tomorrow.


                             SCOTT

               There is no tomorrow! You- you've
               got to kill her and cut- cut her
               up- your sister too.


                             ASHLY

               No, that was only with Shelly. You
               had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves
               me. You're delirious- I...I'll get
               you some water.


     ASHLY places a glass to Scott's lips.


                             ASHLY

               Now, now the sun will be up in an
               hour or so and we'll get out of here
               ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly-
               n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go
               home together. Wouldn't you like to
               be going home? You'd like that I'd
               bet, wouldn't ya?


     There is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of
     his mouth.


                             ASHLY

               ...Scott.


     SCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY
     walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There
     is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the
     Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting
     his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs
     her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it.
     She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs
     her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against
     SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled
     arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and
     grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm
     so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY
     pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-
     ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The
     blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach.
     Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in
     a deep growl once, then all is quiet.

     ASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of
     SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below,
     through the back door and out to the work shed.



85   IN - W.S.


     He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body
     to it with a number of chains which hang from nails
     along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the
     wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves
     toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a
     position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks
     into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He
     turns off the saw.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) Linda...


     He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's
     body.



86   EN - CAB


     An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the
     shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial.
     He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel.
     Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create
     strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's
     grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of
     her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel
     and looks at her. She appears to be dead.



87   IN - M.R.


     Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists
     against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants
     out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to
     loosen.



88   EN - CAB


     ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to
     CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.



89   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the
     trap door in tact.



90   EN - CAB


     ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on
     top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up
     when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and
     grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-
     ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied
     hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she
     will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out
     of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's
     leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large
     log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again
     and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs
     the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him
     up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY
     hits the ground with considerable force and for the
     first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing
     he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's
     nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on
     the ground.


                             ASHLY

               Stay back.


     His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA
     advances toward him, laughing.


                             ASHLY

               Linda please, if you can still hear
               me. Keep away.


     His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream,
     she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the
     spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into
     the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-
     ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from
     her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from
     underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.
     He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace
     upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and
     staggers back to the cabin.



91   IN - M.R.


     Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body.


                             ASHLY

               Oh.....


     It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open
     and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.
     A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing
     SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the
     rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.



92   IN - S.B.


     He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs
     back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward
     it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only
     clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of
     the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him.
     He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL
     backs away and spots the open front door.


                             ASHLY

               The door...


     He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.



93   IN - M.R.


     In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.



94   EN - CAB


     Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door.



95   IN - MR


     ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started
     reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams
     his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard
     as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam
     the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-
     ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to
     the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is
     his last shell.


                             ASHLY

               (To himself) More shells. Where did
               I see that box of shells?



96   IN - C


     From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY
     decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his
     weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks
     himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway
     beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds
     the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.
     He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.



97   IN - M.R.


     The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks
     up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-
     wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,
     ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows
     louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he
     fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind
     whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the
     floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for
     something to happen. He is tense and more determined
     than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.


                             ASHLY

               C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why
               are you torturing me like this?

     Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something
     in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's
     necklace.


                             ASHLY

               ...Linda. (He whispers)


     The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest
     sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through
     the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to
     the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.
     CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole
     in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and
     fires at her head.



98   EN - CAB


     Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL
     is jolted from the door.



99   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in
     the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens
     its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He
     turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.
     Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it
     across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into
     his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several
     steps, then continues after ASHLY.



100  EN - CAB


     Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.



101  IN - M.R.


     ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of
     The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at
     SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer.
     The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges
     of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY
     and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The
     front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY
     brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL
     breaks through the front door and begins to push the
     dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-
     ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and
     slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and
     his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its
     pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and
     enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from
     the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto
     the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives
     him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent
     sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with
     her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl-
     ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the
     book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back-
     ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her
     clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker.
     ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's
     necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp
     toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls
     him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a
     last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the
     final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as
     ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls
     the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and
     tosses it upon the blaze.

     CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in
     a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL
     as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods.
     The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks
     into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The
     bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward
     upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering
     heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing
     and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies
     once were.

     The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly
     climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open-
     ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force
     retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the
     darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural
     sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as
     Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam
     over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally
     come.

Scene #12, Interior, Day, Dining Room










1    ED - W


     Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun-
     tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of
     view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view
     allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the
     forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small
     shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth
     oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by
     this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.



2    ED - CAR


     Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of
     a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other
     peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be
     heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving
     away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-
     pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a
     dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.



3    ID - CAR


     Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY
     and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.
     Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear "Michigan State" T-shirts,
     and are students along with the others at that univer-
     sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up
     front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen
     to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the
     radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it
     were a drum.


                             SHELLY

               (Singing with the music)... Together,
               forever...


                             SCOTT

               Ash, where are we?


                             ASHLY

               I'll tell ya in a second. Now we're
               still on seventy-five just past the
               county border...



4    ED - W


     Once again, the camera takes the point of view of the
     dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge
     to peer downward. Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-
     mobile speeding along the narrow highway below.



5    ID - CAR


     ASHLY traces a route on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Which would put us...which would
               put us...


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ, just tell us already
               will ya?


     ASHLY zeroes in on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


     SCOTT is growing impatient.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


                             SCOTT

               Yes?


                             ASHLY

               Here!


     Suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks
     from SCOTT's hand.



6    ED - CAR


     The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane.
     A large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming
     races toward the car on a collision coarse.



7    ID - CAR


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, watch out!



8    ED - CAR


     The truck races closer.



9    ID - CAR


     Their steering wheel is locked.


                             ASHLY

               Turn!



10   ED - CAR


     At the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can
     be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its
     own lane.



11   ED - CAR


     The truck speeds harmlessly past them.



12   ID - CAR


                             ASHLY

               Damn it Scott, what the hell was that?
               You trying to kill us?


                             SCOTT

               Don't yell at me, it's your lousy
               steering wheel. The damn thing jerked
               right out of my hand.


                             ASHLY

               I can't understand it. I just had
               this thing in for a tune-up.


                             SHELLY

               Radio's dead too, ace.


                             ASHLY

               And I just had 'em tune up the whole
               thing yesterday.


                             SCOTT

               Well, then take it back 'cause the
               damn thing don't work. Only thing
               that works on the whole car is the
               lousy horn.


     SCOTT honks the horn.



13   ED - CAR


     Several local MEN walking down the highway respond to
     the horn by waving.



14   ID - CAR


     SCOTT yells out the window at them.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, go to hell, I'm not waving at ya!


     He looks in the rear view mirror. The MEN are still wav-
     ing in the distance. SCOTT turns back to drive.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     SHELLY turns around in the front seat and holds up a
     pint of Scotch.


                             SHELLY

               Well, I'd like to make a toast. To
               Scott who almost killed us.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, eat shit and die will ya?


     SHELLY and the others laugh.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, okay- then to a wild week-end
               in a wonderful cabin with good friends,
               (She glances at SCOTT) provided we
               live that long.


     SHELLY cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle
     back to ASHLY and LINDA. ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the
     bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks.


                         ASHLY and LINDA

               ...With good friends.


     They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY
     tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of
     LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes
     the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite "No,
     thank you," then back up front to SCOTT.


                             LINDA

               Hey Scotty, what's this place like
               anyway?


                             SCOTT

               Well, the guy that's renting it says
               it's an old place, little run down,
               but it's right up in the mountains-
               totally secluded. (He takes a drink
               from the bottle) Best part is, we
               get it so cheap.


                             LINDA

               Why are we getting it so cheap?


                             SCOTT

               I don't know, might be in real bad
               shape.


                             CHERYL

               You mean nobody's seen this place
               yet?


                             SCOTT

               Not yet.


                             ASHLY

               Might not be too bad.


                             LINDA

               No...


                             ASHLY

               Actually, it might be very nice.


                             LINDA

               Yeah...


                             SHELLY

               It's probably a real pit.


                             CHERYL

               I can't believe that we're renting
               a place for a week-end that nobody's
               seen.


                             SCOTT

               (Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ,
               not this again...


                             CHERYL

               (Turning to ASHLY) You know, mom and
               dad would never let us go up to a place
               like this if they knew-


                             ASHLY

               -Which is exactly why they don't know.
               I'll tell you who I am gonna call.
               The guys that fixed up this car.



15   ED - CAR


     The car approaches an exit along the highway.



16   ID - CAR


     ASHLY glances at the map again.


                             ASHLY

               Hey, I think this is where we get
               off.



17   ED - CAR


     The car turns off the main highway and follows several
     back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that
     winds upward along a twin set of mountains.



18   ID - CAR


     SCOTT glances up to the peaks.


                             SCOTT

               These mountains seem familiar.


                             LINDA

               What do they remind you of? Some-
               thing majestic? Adventure?


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, more like adventure.


                             LINDA

               Any adventure in particular?


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's sweater.


     ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud. LINDA laughs quietly,
     and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself.


                             SHELLY

               (Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it
               Scotty, when you least expect it,
               you're gonna get it good.



19   ED - B


     Finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending
     over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses.



20   ED - CAB


     It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their
     destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by
     thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-
     ues to sputter and backfire.



21   ID - CAR


     ASHLY reacts to his car.


                             ASHLY

               I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up.
               but I'm just not paying for it.


                             LINDA

               This place is perfect.


                             CHERYL

               The woods come awfully close to the
               house don't they?


                             SCOTT

               So what's wrong with the woods, they
               can't bite ya.


                             CHERYL

               It's just a little claustrophobic
               that's all.


                             LINDA

               Well, I think it's beautiful.


                             SHELLY

               Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-
               end.



22   ED - CAB


     SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds
     a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the
     door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others.


                             SCOTT

               It's supposed to be one of these on
               here.


     After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.



23   ID - M.R.


     The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT
     opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway
     for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.
     The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings
     made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,
     and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set
     into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently
     in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door
     in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed
     containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon
     the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap
     door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, this place has a dungeon.


     CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over
     to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing
     the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring
     to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Put these back will you?


     SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the
     hatch but cannot.


                             SCOTT

               They nailed it shut.


                             CHERYL

               Good, I don't like cellars. Probably
               just some garbage down there anyways.


                             SCOTT

               Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in
               cellars. I mean it's not going to
               try and get out or anything.


                             CHERYL

               Well, what's down there?


                             SCOTT

               Well, could be any number of things.
               Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead
               bodies-


                             LINDA

               Hey, look at this!


     LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand-
     father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it
     begins to tick.


                             LINDA

               Ta daaaaaa!


     The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.



24   ET - CAB


     The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.



25   IT - M.R.


     CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She
     is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the
     ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil
     and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-
     ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-
     ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can
     see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-
     mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the
     room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale
     white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.
     She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some
     unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch
     a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open
     window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the
     drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now
     retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale
     cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks
     up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some
     form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.
     She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping
     of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns
     to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-
     sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.
     Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from
     the cellar.



26   IT - K/M.R.


     ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-
     ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between
     her and the trap door.


                             ASHLY

               What're you drawing Cheryl?


     He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his
     shoulder to glance at it.


                             CHERYL

               I...I don't know.


                             ASHLY

               Is it a bible?


                             CHERYL

               No, no it's no bible. (She glances
               again at the cellar, knowing some-
               thing is down there) I don't know
               what it is.


                             LINDA

               Well, this one of the clock's not
               bad.


     LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock
     with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to
     the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She
     is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL
     wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front
     of her to speak secretly.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) I got it right here.


     He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking
     past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's
     feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.
     LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, this is really good. I like
               how you did the numbers in that wood-
               ish style.


     ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it
     quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on
     a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She
     is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although
     nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with
     it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response.


                             ASHLY

               (Still in a whisper) I knew you'd
               like it.


     Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his
     lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-
     rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back
     on CHERYL's small drawing table.


                             LINDA

               It's really good Cheryl. Very close
               to the origional.


                             CHERYL

               (In a relieved whisper) Yes, very
               close.


                             LINDA

               I'm gonna check dinner.


     LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.


                             ASHLY

               You better get washed up. I'll see
               ya in there.


     He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL
     again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of
     view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-
     ing...waiting.



27   IT - K


     A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.
     SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.



28   IT - D.R.


     She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner
     table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA
     and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (In a whisper) Dead bodies in the
               cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...


                             CHERYL

               Will you stop it?


                             LINDA

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


     SCOTT turns toward LINDA.


                             SCOTT

               Will you relax, I'm just kidding
               around. She can take a joke-


     He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He
     turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in
     his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,
     then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (Jokingly) I'll get ya.


     With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.


                             SCOTT

               I'll get ya for this Cheryl.


     ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.


                             ASHLY

               I'd like to make a toast for all
               here this evening. As a greek friend
               of mine once said, "Nis-hat-nis-fert-
               dis-ruben-tu-tar-im."


                             LINDA

               Which means?


                             SCOTT

               Party down!


     The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of
     wood heard from the main room.


                             SCOTT

               What the hell...


     All stand from the table and hurry to the main room.



29   IN - M.R.


     The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped
     out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open.
     They stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to
     what could have done this. CHERYL is slighly more nervous
     than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak.


                             ASHLY

               (Slowly) What is this?


                             SCOTT

               Whatever it is, it's still down there.


                             CHERYL

               I don't like cellars, let's close it
               up. (She does not want to deal with
               it) It's probably just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-
               that's the stupidest thing I ever
               heard in my life. Jesus Christ.


     SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He
     traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.


                             LINDA

               Maybe it is just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, probably right. It's probably
               just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why
               don't you make sure.


     He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it
     back.


                             CHERYL

               Scotty, I'm not going down there!


                             SCOTT

               Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.


                             LINDA

               Scotty don't. You're crazy if you
               go down there. Why don't you wait
               until morning.


                             SCOTT

               Look, I'll be all right.


                             SHELLY

               What melodrama! What courage! A kiss
               my brave hero.


     SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends
     the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.


                             SHELLY

               I, your virgin queen eagerly await
               the precious moment when you will
               ascend.


                             SCOTT

               Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     He disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and
     ASHLY wait above.


                             ASHLY

               (Calling down) Hey Scott, see any-
               thing?


     There is no answer.


                             ASHLY

               Hey Scott!...Scott!


                             SHELLY

               He's just kidding around.


     There is silence.


                             SHELLY

               Isn't he?


     No sounds come from the cellar.


                             ASHLY

               Linda, get me a flashlight.


                             LINDA
               That's the only one we brought up.


     ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle.


                             ASHLY

               Then get that lantern.


     LINDA brings it over. ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,
     lights the wick, and descends into the basement.



30   IN - C


     Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls
     and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In
     front of him stands an old door which leads to another
     section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.
     Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with
     a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into
     the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the
     cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow
     pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his
     light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.


                             ASHLY

               Scott?


     ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from
     the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into
     a pair of arms which grab him.


                             ASHLY

               Ahhhhhhh!


     It is only SCOTT behind him.


                             ASHLY

               What the hell are you doing down
               here, jerkin' off? How come you
               didn't answer me?


                             SCOTT

               When?


                             ASHLY

               Just now, I mean upstairs.


                             SCOTT

               I didn't hear you.


                             ASHLY

               Oh well, did you find anything?


                             SCOTT

               Uh-uh.


                             ASHLY

               What's this?


     SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals
     several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,
     he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort
     of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the
     cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover
     a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and
     other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.



31   EN - CAB


     It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.



32   IN - M.R.


     The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking
     quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed
     around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once
     this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man
     is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking.


                             ASHLY

               Shhh, listen to this.


                             VOICE

               My name is Julian Knowby. I am a pro-
               fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology
               in Dextin university's ancient history
               department...


                             ASHLY

               This is the tape I found downstairs.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...I am recording this
               entry from a small cabin in the south-
               ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am
               staying with my wife for a few weeks
               so that I may continue my research un-
               disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc-
               iate professors and myself have been
               excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I
               believe I have made an important find
               in that area, and thus the reason for
               this log. With it, I can keep an ac-
               curate record of translations from
               my latest find; the first of six, the
               others still lost, volumes of ancient
               Sumarian burial practices and rites.
               Basically, it is a book of do's and
               don'ts dealing with the deceased en-
               titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans-
               lated "Book Of The Dead." It is bound
               in human flesh, and inked with blood
               of the deceased...


                             SCOTT

               Jeez, I'd hate to find out what they
               used for pens.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...This particular volume
               deals with demons and demon resurrect-
               ion. These are of the Katardi family,
               meaning those forces believed to inhab-
               it the jungles and woods of man's do-
               main. The first few pages that I have

                             SCOTT

               Hey, what'd you do that for? It was
               just getting good.


                             CHERYL

               I just don't want to hear any more
               that's all.


                             SCOTT

               (Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's
               scared.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     He moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for
     a bit then stops.


                             SCOTT

               She's acting like a baby- it's no
               big deal.


     He turns the machine on. The passage continues.

     A section of ground deep within the woods begins to crack,

               (Louder now) Shut it off.


     ASHLY, hearing her for the first time, turns from the
     window to CHERYL. She is overwhealmed with fear.

               Kanda!

     A bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder

     CHERYL can no longer control herself. She screams and
     covers her ears.


                             CHERYL

               Shut it offffff!


     The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree
     tears through it. ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and
     turns it off. CHERYL is crying now, and runs to her room.
     ASHLY turns to SCOTT.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, you knew not to play it, I
               mean...I mean you knew it was upset-
               ting her. You just don't know when
               you're carrying something too far.


                             SCOTT

               (To SHELLY) C'mon. (Back to ASHLY)
               Big deal, it's just a joke, shit.


     SCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom. SCOTT mumbles
     to himself along the way.


                             SCOTT

               You'd think she's three years old or
               something.


     SCOTT slams the door behind him. ASHLY sighs. He moves
     to the broken window and reaches through it to close
     the outside shutters.


                             LINDA

               He's really been bothering you hasn't
               he?


     ASHLY walks to a chair near the other window.


                             ASHLY

               No. It's not Scott. Scotty's okay.
               It's just that ever since we came
               up here, things have been a little
               too tense. (He sits) All these crazy
               things going on. And look at that
               window- we're gonna have to pay for
               that window now.


                             LINDA

               It'll be better tomorrow. Things'll
               smooth out, you'll see.


                             ASHLY

               I hope so.


     He looks at LINDA lovingly for a long moment.


                             ASHLY

               What'ya say we stay up for a while
               and listen to the storm.


                             LINDA

               Deal. Lemme check on Cheryl. I'll be
               right back.


     From across the room, she is seen opening CHERYL's door
     a crack. LINDA asks if she is all right, and gets a
     muffled reply. In the foreground, ASHLY removes the
     small box he showed to CHERYL earlier and places it in
     his hand. He glances behind to LINDA. She closes CHERYL's
     door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the
     box in his hand. She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens
     his eyes to watch. LINDA looks at him, but his eyes are
     closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. LINDA
     turns her attention back to the box. ASHLY watches again
     wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand. Quickly,
     LINDA turns to him but as expected, ASHLY is sleeping
     like a baby. She begins to turn back toward the box
     and ASHLY opens his eyes, but LINDA turns back again
     in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.


                             LINDA

               Ah ha!


                             ASHLY

               (Laughing) Stealing from the blind
               eh? It's for you.


     LINDA begins to open the box.


                             LINDA

               It better be good.


     The gold necklace is revealed inside.


                             LINDA

               Oh Ash, it's beautiful.


     LINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box
     and holds it around her neck.


                             ASHLY

               (Fastening it around her neck) I was
               going to give it to you before we
               left, but things got so hectic, this
               is the first chance I've had. Do you
               like it?


     LINDA moves to a mirror.


                             LINDA

               It's beautiful. I really love it.
               (She turns to ASHLY) I'll never take
               it off.

     Lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the
     small cottage. Through the outside window, ASHLY and
     LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them
     moves around the house to another window. The silhouette
     of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force
     continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside,
     she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a
     moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window.
     She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks
     at it, then out to the dark woods.



44   IN - C.B.


     CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the
     same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A
     noise almost like that of something breathing.



45   EN - CAB


     The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL
     walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be
     seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind
     shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering
     about.


                             CHERYL

               (Calling to the woods) Is anybody
               out there?


     There is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage
     toward the woods.



46   EN - W


     The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive.
     CHERYL stops.


                             CHERYL

               I know someone's out there...I
               heard you...I heard you in the cellar.


     Suddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms
     around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening.
     There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind
     blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest
     a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can
     be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows
     somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of
     something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth
     again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin
     when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty
     yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.
     Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She
     turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,
     leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then,
     all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry
     of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap
     around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches
     near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now
     moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to
     break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges
     from the woods and into the clearing. The force is
     still following.



47   EN - CAB


     CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked. She
     begins pounding upon the door.


                             CHERYL

               Help, help, let me in. Open the door!


     The evil entity now emerges from the woods.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly! Linda! Open up!


     CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where
     SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran-
     tically jams one key after another into the lock, but
     still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer
     with each key.


                             CHERYL

               Please, someone please! Help me, help
               meeeee!


     The evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are
     so frantic that the ring falls to the ground. She bends
     down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is
     SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She
     pushes him in the door and slams it tightly.

                             CHERYL

               (In hysterics) It...it tried to kill
               me. I, I heard a noise and...and I
               ran and the trees...the trees!


                             SCOTT

               What are you-


     He is cut off by ASHLY approaching with the others.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl what's wrong with you? Did
               something in the woods do this to
               you?


                             CHERYL

               No, no, no...the woods themselves-
               The trees- they're alive...


     She hugs ASHLY tightly and cries in hysterical sobs.


                             CHERYL

               They're alive...


                             LINDA

               Ash, why don't I take her into the
               bedroom so she can lie down a little-


                             CHERYL

               (Cutting her off) -I'm not lying
               down! I'm not staying here. We're
               leaving this place, we're leaving
               this place right now!


                             SCOTT

               Wait a minute, I'm sure as hell not
               going anywhere.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl-


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
               Trees do not attack people.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly, will you drive me into town
               or not?


                             ASHLY

               (Looking at his watch) Right Now?
               (He realizes how desperate she is)
               Sure, sure I'll drive you into town.
               But if you'll just listen to what
               you're saying, you-


                             CHERYL

               I don't care how it sounds. I want
               to leave this minute. You can bring
               back my things when you go.


                             ASHLY

               Okay- if you don't want to stay, I
               can't make you.


     LINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to
     the door.

     ASHLY and CHERYL move to the car. ASHLY helps CHERYL in
     then then gets in the drivers side.

                             CHERYL

               I'll stay some place in town tonight.


     ASHLY tries to start the car. There is no response.
     CHERYL becomes somewhat worried. ASHLY tries again.
     The car will not turn over. A look of dread comes
     across CHERYL's face.



51   EN - CAB


     SCOTT and the others join the two outside.



52   IN - CAR


                             CHERYL

               It's not gonna start.


     ASHLY again tries the engine.


                             CHERYL

               I know it's not gonna start. It's
               not gonna let us leave.


     ASHLY keys the engine and it turns over this time, start-
     ing up with a roar. ASHLY, worried by CHERYL's condition
     glances over to her. Confused and upset, CHERYL turns
     away from ASHLY and looks out her window. They drive off
     into the night through the wooded mountains toward town.
     ASHLY glances at CHERYL who is studying the forest in-
     tensely for any sign of movement. The concern for his
     sister is made obvious by the expression on his face.
     Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows
     down.


                             CHERYL

               Why are you slowing down?


     ASHLY brings the car to a halt.


                             CHERYL

               What is this?


     ASHLY's gaze is fixed directly ahead, and his mouth opens
     slowly. He flips on the high beams which stab through the
     evening mist.

     The bridge over the chasm has been torn away. CHERYL is
     silent as ASHLY walks to the ravine's edge to examine
     any remains.

               no...it's not going to let us leave,
               it's not going to let us go...it's

     An axe is raised into the air, then brought down smash-
     ing upon a log, splitting it in two. SCOTT is chopping
     wood outside the cabin. Behind him, through a window,
     CHERYL sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him.
     SCOTT sets his axe down, gathers the wood and moves
     away. CHERYL shifts her gaze from SCOTT to the woods
     beyond. The camera moves in toward CHERYL then past
     her to SHELLY and LINDA who can be seen playing cards
     on the floor. ASHLY is seated near the fireplace with
     the tape recorder in front of him. He plugs an earphone
     in so only he can hear it. SCOTT enters the cabin and
     passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side
     of the fireplace. He throws a log in, and heads back
     outside.



56   IN - M.R.


     From inside, LINDA speaks.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, wanna play some cards?


                             CHERYL

               (Turning with a smile) Uh-uh.


     CHERYL turns to face the window again.


                             LINDA

               Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find
               some way around that cliff into town
               okay?


                             CHERYL

               Okay.


     Outside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights
     fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with
     the ear plug.

               March 12th. Suzanne came after me
               and almost murdered me. My own wife.
               At first I thought it was a mental
               or physical disorder because of what
               had happened to her eyes, but I was
               only fooling myself. I knew what it
               was.


     Outside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather
     wood. SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds
     up one in particular.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, guess this card.


                             LINDA

               How am I going to know what card
               that is?


                             SHELLY

               Guess, I'm going to see if you're
               psychic.


     The card is a two of clubs.


                             LINDA

               Okaaaay...is it a queen?


                             SHELLY

               Right!


                             LINDA

               Really?


                             SHELLY

               Yeah.


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, I guessed the card right.


                             ASHLY

               (indifferently) Truly amazing Linda.


     He is listening intently to the log as it continues.


                             VOICE

               Three days have passed since that
               thing has been down there. I was hop-
               ing to weaken it without food or
               water. Nothing worked. Finally, in
               desperation I dragged her out to the
               shed and dismembered her so that what-
               ever it was could not get up again.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl, did you see that?


     CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the
     window.


                             SHELLY

               Try this one.


     She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.


                             LINDA

               Okay, lemme think, uh...


     She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-
     ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.


                             LINDA

               ...Um, it's a seven.


                             SHELLY

               Oh my God, what suit?


                             LINDA

               Diamonds, no wait! I mean hearts!


                             SHELLY

               That's right- seven of hearts!


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, did you see that? I guessed
               two cards in a row.


                             ASHLY

               (Still not paying attention) How do
               you do it Linda?


     He is concentrating on the tape.


                             VOICE

               This is when I saw the dark figures
               moving about in the woods. I should
               have never tampered with the "Book
               Of The Dead." I now know that what-
               ever it is I have resurrected through
               this book, is coming for me.


                             LINDA

               You know, I always thought I had
               some sort of extra sense. You know,
               like e.s.p or something.


                             SHELLY

               What's this one?


     She holds up the queen of spades.


                             LINDA

               Another seven!


                             SHELLY

               I don't believe it!


                             CHERYL

               (Still looking outside) Queen of
               spades.


     SHELLY looks at her card then back to CHERYL. She holds
     up another card.


                             CHERYL

               Four of hearts.


     The card is a four of hearts. SHELLY bites her lip in
     fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen
     in silence.


                             CHERYL

               Eight of spades.


     SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again.


                             CHERYL

               Two of spades- jack of diamonds-
               jack of clubs-


     Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY
     can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward
     the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of
     cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor.
     CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about
     like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un-
     like her own.


                             CHERYL

               Why have you disturbed our sleep,
               awakened us from our ancient slum-
               ber? You will die. Like the others
               before you. We will take you one by
               one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the
     floor.


                             ASHLY

               Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here!


     SHELLY does not respond.


                             ASHLY

               Hurry!


     She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL
     and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but
     behind her, she reaches for a pen.


                             LINDA

               Did you see her eyes? I'm scared.
               What's wrong with her?


     ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter.


                             SCOTT

               What happened to her?


     CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly.


                             LINDA

               Look at her eyes.


     SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them,
     but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward,
     then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon.
     LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied
     pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping
     her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining
     arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin
     floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting
     him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book-
     case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight.
     SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward
     ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull
     himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when
     SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses
     him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to
     his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above
     ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the
     jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA
     and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She
     begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut
     upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push
     the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top
     and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the
     butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented
     screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand
     is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the
     chain across the hatch.



57   IN - LB


     Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping.
     ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks
     to the door, closing it quietly behind him.



58   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in
     the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and
     laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's
     breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her
     breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.


                             SCOTT

               She'll be okay Ash, she just took a
               bad bump.


                             ASHLY

               (Quietly) Yeah.


     SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below
     as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond.


                             ASHLY

               We've still got a few hours before
               morning.


                             SHELLY

               I don't know if I can wait that
               long.


                             SCOTT

               You have to. We all have to. Then,
               once it's light out, we'll try to
               find a way to get around that chasm.


                             SHELLY

               (Covering her ears) Why does she keep
               making those horrible noises?


                             ASHLY

               I don't know.


                             SHELLY

               And what about her eyes?


     ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet.


                             SHELLY

               What about her eyes? (Desperately)
               For God's sake what happened to
               her eyes?!


     CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a
     streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the
     trap door. Her head is slightly tilted as she watches
     and listens to what is said above. From her point of
     view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be all right.


     CHERYL's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow
     liquid drools out between her teeth. She grins.



59   EN - CAB


     Outside, the forest is very dark. The unseen force moves
     from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs
     as it advances. The cottage comes into view and the evil
     entity glides up to it. The figure of a girl in the cabin
     window can be seen looking out. The force stops and moves
     behind a bush.



60   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SHELLY is studying the woods.


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, I...I think there's some-
               thing out there.


     SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out.



61   EN - CAB


     From within the woods, this force watches SCOTT peer out,
     but he can see nothing. Through the window he says some-
     thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away.



62   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence.


                             SCOTT

               ...Is to get some rest. Ash and I
               can stay up with Cheryl.


                             SHELLY

               Okay.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be okay. Come
               morning- you'll see.


     SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the
     fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with
     the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY
     glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock.
     It stands silent.



63   EN - CAB


     Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees
     SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another.
     She begins to undress near the window. The force now
     moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous
     speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window.
     She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream
     stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.



64   IN - M.R.


     A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the
     small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places
     the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly, are you okay?


     She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns
     to ASHLY.


                             SCOTT

               Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute.



65   IN - S.B.


     SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing
     amidst the shadows.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows
     upon the curtains.



66   IN - S. BATH


     SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the
     shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT
     turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the
     doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT.
     Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's
     face and clothes with her nails.



67   IN - S.B.


     Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY
     still upon him biting at his throat.



68   IN - M.R.


     They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to
     knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace. She
     remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot
     coals. SCOTT rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her
     out. SHELLY's face and hair on one side of her head are
     seared and blackened. She blinks her eyes open, turns
     her charred head to SCOTT, and speaks in a rasp.


                             SHELLY

               Thank you. I don't know what I would
               have done if I had remained on the hot
               coals burning my pretty flesh. You
               have pretty skin- give it to us!


     Cackling, SHELLY clutches SCOTT's neck and begins throttl-
     ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip. He tries
     to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with
     a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-
     ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from
     SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up
     the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat
     with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.
     ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT
     grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings
     his camping knife from its side sheath and slices
     deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.
     A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits
     an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's
     throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches
     terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling
     hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and
     bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor
     with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now
     almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the
     dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming
     the blade into her spine.

     SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the
     old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all
     at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her
     remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife
     protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours
     from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY
     stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.
     Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes
     about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-
     ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to
     his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg.


                             SCOTT

               Ahhhhhhh!


     Some force reanimates her, even though the body is
     dead.


                             ASHLY

               No...no...no...


                             SCOTT

               Hit her!


     SHELLY's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet,
     and laughing madly.


                             SCOTT

               Hit it!


     SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands
     with the axe, paralyzed. Gurgling black ooze, SHELLY
     advances toward them with one remaining arm. SCOTT
     grabs the axe from ASHLY, pushes him away and slams
     it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and
     CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe
     down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the
     final chop, there is silence.

     SHELLY's body remains on the floor for quite some time-
     until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and
     something must be done.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...Scott.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah.


                             ASHLY

               What is uh...what are we gonna do?


                             SCOTT

               Bury her.


                             ASHLY

               You...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend
               of ours isn't she?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, she's dead.


     ASHLY moves away from SCOTT.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's dead. We're gonna bury
               her now.


     ASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly.



69   EN - CAB


     Finally, the body is dragged outside and buried near
     the work shed. Harsh floodlights from the house make the
     task look very stark and barren.



70   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's
     room to check in on her.



71   IN - L.B.


     He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully.



72   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY quietly returns to the main room. SCOTT is load-
     ing new batteries into a flashlight.


                             SCOTT

               I saw an old hiking trail when we
               were driving up here. Now I don't
               know if it goes all the way around
               that gorge-


                             ASHLY

               -Or if it's even still in tact.


                             SCOTT

               Or if it's even still in tact. But
               uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good
               care of Linda.


                             ASHLY

               I will. Do you have everything?


                             SCOTT

               (Putting on a small back pack) Yeah-
               all set.


                             ASHLY

               Listen...Scotty...I'm sorry about
               falling apart like that when-


                             SCOTT

               Don't bother, really.


     He steps out the door.


                             SCOTT

               If I find a way out of here, I'll
               mark it and then come back. Then if
               I'm not back here in a few hours...
               if for some reason...well, if I don't
               come back, grab Linda, leg and all,
               and just get her the hell out of here.


     They shake hands.


                             ASHLY

               You're a good man.


                             SCOTT

               Good, I'm the best.



73   EN - CAB


     ASHLY smiles a good-bye to SCOTT and watches him move
     off into the night. He lingers for a moment by SHELLY's
     grave, then slowly disappears into the woods.



74   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY closes the door and turns back to the main room.
     He sees CHERYL's eyes through the crack in the cellar.
     She has been watching all of this through a space be-
     tween the trap door and floor. ASHLY walks past her to
     LINDA's room.



75   IN - L.B.


     He opens the door and a crack of light falls across her.
     LINDA wakes up.


                             LINDA

               Who's there? Ash?


                             ASHLY

               It's me Linda.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I had a bad dream about Linda.


                             ASHLY

               You did baby?


                             LINDA

               Yeah. She's all right isn't she?


                             ASHLY

               Yeah. Fine.


                             LINDA

               Is Shelly okay too Ash?


     ASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. He speaks
     in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, sure. She's sleeping that's
               all.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I love you. (She turns over)


                             ASHLY

               Get some rest.


     ASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few
     hours ago engulfs him once more.



76   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his
     tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks.


                             CHERYL

               You lied to her. You lied to Linda.
               Shelly's not sleeping. She's dead.
               Don't you know the difference? You
               killed her. You and Scott cut her up
               with the axe. She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha-
               ha-ha-


     ASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap
     door. CHERYL is silent from below for a moment, then
     the hatch opens an inch or so. (The length of the chain
     securing it) CHEYL's white eyes can be seen again.


                             CHERYL

               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY takes the axe and steps outside.



77   EN - CAB


     He begins to chop wood, taking out his emotions upon
     the logs with each blow. SHELLY's blood can still be
     seen on the blade of the axe.



78   IN - M.R.


     From her dungeon, CHERYL watches ASHLY chop wood in the
     window. The shadow of his axe rising then striking is
     seen over her white eyes.



79   EN - CAB


     Exhausted, ASHLY puts down the axe. He looks off into
     the woods but there is no sign of SCOTT. He returns to
     the cabin.



80   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL begins her taunting again.


                             CHERYL

               Soon all of you will be like me and
               then who will lock you in the cellar?
               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     CHERYL begins to violently ram her fists against the trap
     door. ASHLY walks by her to LINDA's room.



81   IN - L.B.


     She is still asleep. Quietly, so as not to wake her, ASHLY
     pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg. He re-
     moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. As he does
     this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-
     credible speed. ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still
     sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with
     white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. She lets
     out a low growl.



82   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through
     the front door. He steps outside and stops to look back
     in. He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to
     see in LINDA's room, being lost in the shadows. Something
     ragged and bloody grabs him. It is SCOTT's mutilated
     body ripped and torn to shreds. He is still alive. ASHLY
     looks behind him through the door to LINDA's room. He
     can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching
     him with glaring white eyes. ASHLY helps SCOTT to the
     couch so he can sit. SCOTT is in agony and can barely
     speak.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I think I'm dying. Jesus, I
               can't feel my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...uh Scotty you're gonna be okay.
               You're gonna be just fine- you'll see.


     He throws another log on the fire.


                             ASHLY

               You'll see.


     He looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone.
     She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where
     ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor-
     rible rasping sounds.

                             SCOTT

               It's, it's not gonna let us leave...
               Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're
               all gonna die here...


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die!


                             SCOTT

               ...All gonna die. All of us.


     ASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently.


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die! We're not gonna
               die! We're getting out of here! Now
               listen to me- is there a way around
               the chasm.


     SCOTT passes out.


                             ASHLY

               Scotty. Scott!


     ASHLY slaps SCOTT. He stirs awake and mumbles.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Ash. I don't want to die. So...
               so lonely to die like this. You're not
               gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash?


                             CHERYL

               (Imitating SCOTT) I don't want to
               die. So lonely to die like this. You're
               not gonna leave me are you? Are you
               Ash? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


                             ASHLY

               Scott, is there some way around the
               chasm?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I'm scared- I...I can't feel
               my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, listen to me please, for
               God's sake. Is there a way around
               the chasm?


                             SCOTT

               There is...one way, the trail...but
               the trees, they know...don't you see-
               they're alive!! They're ali-ahhhhhhh!


     His sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain.
     Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over
     grabbing his stomach. LINDA begins to laugh. ASHLY looks
     to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.


                             ASHLY

               Shut up!


     She continues to laugh. CHERYL in the cellar joins in
     the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but
     she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on
     the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety
     and places the barrels against LINDA's head.


                             ASHLY

               God forgive me Linda.


     The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. It
     is LINDA again. ASHLY puts down the rifle.


                             LINDA

               Ash, oh Ash, help Me! Please.


     She hugs him tightly.


                             LINDA

               Don't let them take me away again,
               please, please, please.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and holding her tightly) I
               won't, I won't- I promise.


     CHERYL's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly? Ashly, help me. Let me out
               of here. I'm all right now.


     ASHLY releases LINDA and moves cautiously to the cellar.
     LINDA remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace.


                             CHERYL

               I'm all right now, Ashly. I'm all
               right. Come unlock this chain and
               let me out.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     There is no reply from the cellar. ASHLY looks through
     the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the
     chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something
     wrong, he stops.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight-
     est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards
     and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand
     reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly
     it withdraws beneath the floor.


                             CHERYL

               (A little too sweet) Ash, what are you
               doing? This is your sister Cheryl. Don't
               you recognize me?


     Her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from
     the celler.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and yelling to the cellar)
               You bastards! Why are you doing this?
               Why?


     There is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him
     begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more,
     and she laughs at ASHLY.


                             ASHLY

               Oh...Linda.


     With newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by
     the legs and drags her outside.



83   EN - CAB


                             LINDA

               It's useless, useless, useless. In
               time we'll come for him, then you
               ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin,
     closing the door behind him.



84   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT is coughing again.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, Ash, please...I don't want to
               die- but...but I can't stand this
               pain. It hurts Ash. Gimme something.
               Gimme something to put me out.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, I can't. I- I know it's bad.
               But I can't be alone now, I can't.
               I'd lose my mind.


                             SCOTT

               Please Ash, please.


                             ASHLY

               You'll get better- you'll see.


     LINDA's laughter is faintly heard outside. ASHLY moves
     to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no
     longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-
     ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be
               better and we'll both get out of
               here tomorrow.


                             SCOTT

               There is no tomorrow! You- you've
               got to kill her and cut- cut her
               up- your sister too.


                             ASHLY

               No, that was only with Shelly. You
               had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves
               me. You're delirious- I...I'll get
               you some water.


     ASHLY places a glass to Scott's lips.


                             ASHLY

               Now, now the sun will be up in an
               hour or so and we'll get out of here
               ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly-
               n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go
               home together. Wouldn't you like to
               be going home? You'd like that I'd
               bet, wouldn't ya?


     There is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of
     his mouth.


                             ASHLY

               ...Scott.


     SCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY
     walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There
     is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the
     Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting
     his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs
     her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it.
     She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs
     her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against
     SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled
     arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and
     grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm
     so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY
     pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-
     ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The
     blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach.
     Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in
     a deep growl once, then all is quiet.

     ASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of
     SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below,
     through the back door and out to the work shed.



85   IN - W.S.


     He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body
     to it with a number of chains which hang from nails
     along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the
     wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves
     toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a
     position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks
     into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He
     turns off the saw.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) Linda...


     He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's
     body.



86   EN - CAB


     An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the
     shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial.
     He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel.
     Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create
     strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's
     grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of
     her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel
     and looks at her. She appears to be dead.



87   IN - M.R.


     Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists
     against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants
     out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to
     loosen.



88   EN - CAB


     ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to
     CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.



89   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the
     trap door in tact.



90   EN - CAB


     ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on
     top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up
     when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and
     grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-
     ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied
     hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she
     will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out
     of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's
     leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large
     log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again
     and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs
     the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him
     up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY
     hits the ground with considerable force and for the
     first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing
     he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's
     nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on
     the ground.


                             ASHLY

               Stay back.


     His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA
     advances toward him, laughing.


                             ASHLY

               Linda please, if you can still hear
               me. Keep away.


     His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream,
     she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the
     spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into
     the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-
     ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from
     her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from
     underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.
     He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace
     upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and
     staggers back to the cabin.



91   IN - M.R.


     Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body.


                             ASHLY

               Oh.....


     It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open
     and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.
     A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing
     SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the
     rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.



92   IN - S.B.


     He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs
     back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward
     it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only
     clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of
     the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him.
     He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL
     backs away and spots the open front door.


                             ASHLY

               The door...


     He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.



93   IN - M.R.


     In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.



94   EN - CAB


     Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door.



95   IN - MR


     ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started
     reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams
     his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard
     as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam
     the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-
     ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to
     the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is
     his last shell.


                             ASHLY

               (To himself) More shells. Where did
               I see that box of shells?



96   IN - C


     From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY
     decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his
     weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks
     himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway
     beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds
     the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.
     He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.



97   IN - M.R.


     The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks
     up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-
     wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,
     ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows
     louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he
     fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind
     whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the
     floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for
     something to happen. He is tense and more determined
     than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.


                             ASHLY

               C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why
               are you torturing me like this?

     Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something
     in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's
     necklace.


                             ASHLY

               ...Linda. (He whispers)


     The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest
     sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through
     the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to
     the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.
     CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole
     in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and
     fires at her head.



98   EN - CAB


     Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL
     is jolted from the door.



99   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in
     the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens
     its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He
     turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.
     Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it
     across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into
     his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several
     steps, then continues after ASHLY.



100  EN - CAB


     Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.



101  IN - M.R.


     ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of
     The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at
     SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer.
     The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges
     of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY
     and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The
     front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY
     brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL
     breaks through the front door and begins to push the
     dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-
     ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and
     slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and
     his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its
     pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and
     enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from
     the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto
     the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives
     him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent
     sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with
     her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl-
     ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the
     book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back-
     ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her
     clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker.
     ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's
     necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp
     toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls
     him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a
     last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the
     final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as
     ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls
     the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and
     tosses it upon the blaze.

     CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in
     a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL
     as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods.
     The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks
     into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The
     bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward
     upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering
     heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing
     and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies
     once were.

     The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly
     climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open-
     ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force
     retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the
     darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural
     sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as
     Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam
     over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally
     come.

      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               To trace the origin of the Book, we
               must go back...back...to a day when
               spirits ruled the earth.

      An ox grazes nearby.  4 Warriors on horseback in the BG.

               It was then that the dark spirits
               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.
               And there it lay for 700 years...

      As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same
      castle which we saw earlier, but now, in a ruined state.
      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its
      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               ...Waiting.

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and
      toward the castle.

      TRACKING SHOT

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

      A great wind billows fog about the place.

               Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife,
               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small
               cabin where they could study it
               undisturbed.


10    INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          10

      Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and
      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.

      The sound of RAYMOND reciting the passages is faded
      down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and
      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.

      A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten

      He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and
      distraught.

					RAYMOND
               It has only been a few hours since
               I've translated and spoke aloud the first
               of the demon resurrection passages from
               the Book of the Dead.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO
      FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

					RAYMOND
               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this

      within.  The silhouette of a woman sweeps by the rear
      bedroom window.

      ASH AND LINDA

      LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in
      the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan
      State University" sweatshirt.  She hums melodically to
      the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a
      delicate silver necklace.


14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14C

      A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music
      on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash
      is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the
      melody with two fingers.

                              LINDA
               Ash, what's that you're playing?

                              ASH
               Our song.

      Ash begins to play faster.

      spin.


14E   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    14E

      Out of breath, hair tousled across her eyes, she
      stares deeply into Ash's eyes.  Her lips, parted,
      in a sensual manner.


14F   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      14F

      He returns her stare, lost in her beauty.  He pulls
      her close.

                              LINDA
               Ow!


14G   SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY                               14G

      And looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she
      wears about her neck.

               I really love it.  I'll never take
               it off.

      They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the
      haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.

               It was in the cabin's cellar that they

      The CAMERA pans down from the blackness to Ash who

      tapes, the Kandarian dagger and...

      of Raymond Knowby reciting the demon resurrection passage.

      The cabin is in the distance.  In the foreground the
      earth begins to swell, then rips apart as a red glow
      emanates from beneath.  Something evil is being
      unleashed.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One by one, they fell to the possession

      of lightning strikes.

      FINAL SHOT OF EVIL DEAD I

      We are racing forward.  We have taken the POV of
      an EVIL ENTITY as it glides with dark purpose through
      a section of woods. It approaches the rear door of the
      cabin.  The door is torn violently open.  The next door
      falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It
      jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of
      the cabin.  Ash is seen in the distance.  He is staggering
      away, his back to us as we race at him.  He turns suddenly
      towards CAMERA and screams.

      The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an
      extension. Ash is caught by an invisible grip.
      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the
      air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins
      tearing through the branches and smaller trees,
      clearing a path with his body.  He finally slams into
      a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked
      unconscious.

      He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us.
      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,
      his lips, jet black.  He is Possessed.  A bright edge of
      morning sunlight moves across his face.  He turns his
      beastly face skyward.

      unconscious.

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the
      woods.  We hear the shriek of demons.  The sound of
      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted

      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to
      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it
      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      within the car throughout the chase to follow.

      Looking through the windshield, as branches beat and
      smash themselves against the windshield, obscuring
      our vision of the "Road" ahead.  Our view suddenly
      clears, revealing a large tree that looms directly
      ahead.

76A   ANGLE - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                           76A

      As he runs toward the cabin.  (Actually he is running
      in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly
      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the
      farther away from the cabin he gets.

      It approaches the rear of the Delta, rips through the

      still blasting, and bursts out the remains of the front
      windshield.  We move through the steam of the radiator
      and approach Ash as he runs for the cabin.


78    CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      78

      As he runs toward the cabin not making much progress
      as though caught running in a nightmare.  He shakes his

      We race into the cabin, splintering the hall door
      which Ash had swung shut.  Ash retreats into the
      rear hallway, and swings the hallway door shut.  We race
      right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces
      as we glide forward.


83    INT. CABIN - STUDIO - "MAZE SHOT" - FORCE POV         83

      Camera moves through the main room and up to the
      Hallway door.  It shatters in front of us.  We close
      in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him
      as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and
      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      The force begins to pull back with an ever-increasing

      A static shot of the fireplace.  All is quiet.  Smoke
      from the near dead fire wafts up the chimney.  We hold
      on this for a moment.

      A static shot of a closet with it's door half open.
      The door begins to swing slightly open, revealing
      a rack of clothes inside.  We hold on this for a
      moment.


85B   ANGLE - CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT       85B

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin
      to tremble and finally blow away from the light breeze
      that sweeps through the cabin.  The CAMERA PANS down
      from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of
      the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is
      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that
      slight space between the trap door and the floor we
      see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes
      a sigh of relief.

      The airplane rolls to a halt.  A man wearing a
      jumpsuit ties the airplane off and blocks the wheels
      while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie
      Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she
      moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers
      emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie.

                              ED
               Annie!

                              ANNIE

      They embrace and kiss.

                              ED
               How'd everything go on the expedition?

                              ANNIE
               Terrific.  I found the additional pages
               from the Book of the Dead.

                              ED
               So you said in the telegram.  What

                              ED
               When do we begin the translations?

                              ANNIE
               Tonight.  Is everything all set with my
               father?

                              ED
               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap
      hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.

                              ED
               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides
      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view
      of the boarded cabin in the distance.  It approaches.
      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.


152   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          152

      Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which
      lay upon the cabin floor.  Camera pans to window #1.
      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.


156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      156

      He recognizes the music.  It is the same music that Ash
      had played earlier, when Linda was dancing.


157   CLOSE SHOT - PIANO AND RADIATOR                       157

      louder.

      As he lowers his head.  His horror gives way to sadness.
      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and
      splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed
      as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its
      feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the
      night air.

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      Linda's head rolls off of her neck and tumbles through
      space.


176   INT. BLACK STUDIO - NIGHT                             176
      LINDA'S HEAD - ON WIRE

      As it tumbles through a void of blackness, falling.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH

      As he screams himself awake.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
      him sitting in the rocking chair.  Ash halts his scream,
      getting control of himself.  He looks to the window that
      had blown open.


178   ASH'S POV - THE BOARDED WINDOW                        178

      Still boarded as though it had never been opened.


179   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      179

      Reassuring himself.

                              ASH
               That's all.  Just a crummy dr-

      Linda's decapitated head falls into frame and lands in
      Ash's hands.


180   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             180

      It opens its eyes and looks to Ash.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Hello lover, I came from the other
               side of your dream to dance with you.


181   CLOSER SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD (BACKWARD MOTION)          181

      A four foot long blackened tongue emerges from her mouth
      like a lashing serpent.


182   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - (BACKWARD MOTION)                 182

      The tongue enters Ash's frame and forces itself into
      Ash's mouth.  Screaming as he clutches at the head of his
      former love.  The tongue instantly retracts inside her
      head.


183   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             183

186   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - ASH AND DUMMY HEAD - LONG SHOT   186

      As Ash staggers painfully around the side of the
      cabin and towards the work shed; Linda's head still
      clamped to his hand.


187   INT. WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash
      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.  It is a room
      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.


187A  MEDIUM SHOT - INT. WORK SHED - ASH                    187A

      As he places Linda's head within the vice and
      tightens it around her, then withdraws his hand.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Even now we have your darling Linda's
               soul!  She suffers in torment!


187B  CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               187B

      As it rips away an old tarp revealing the chalk
      outline of where a chainsaw once was.


187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the
      chainsaw.  Behind him, the door to the shed bursts
      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.


187D  MEDIUM SHOT                                           187D

      Ash grabs a large crowbar and swings it
      toward the approaching blade.


187E  CLOSE SHOT                                            187E

      The crowbar hits the bottom of the blade with a
      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.


187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.


187G  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187G

      Linda's head.


187J  WIDE SHOT - ASH AND LINDA'S HEAD IN VICE              187J

      From the chainsaw, fumes of blue amoke.  Ash turns
      to the head and falters.


187K  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD IN VICE                     187K

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.


187L  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187L

      Trying to fight his feelings, he knows what he must
      do.  He pumps the throttle on the saw.


187M  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    187M

      Pleading with him.

                              LINDA
               You promised me we'd always be
               together.  You swore to me!


187N  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187N

      Agonized.

                              ASH
               NO!


187O  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             187O

      Once again fully possessed, and speaking in the voice
      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO
               LINDA! YOUR LOVE WAS A LIE!  AND
               NOW SHE BURNS IN HELL!

187Q  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187Q

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.


187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R

187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.


188   CRANE SHOT - EXT. WORK SHED - NIGHT                   188

      Ash in a confused state as he staggers from the
      work shed and towards the cabin.  Again clutching
      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.


189B  INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          189B

      Ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the
      sound.


189C  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV - THE ROCKING CHAIR     189C

      It rocks back and forth with a definitive motion,
      halting for a moment at it's pints furthest forward
      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

      He slowly approaches the chair, scared shitless.


189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...


191   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM/MIRROR ROOM - NIGHT              191
      MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - ASH AND REFLECTION

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.


192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192
      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      His reflection is as it should be.


195   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      195

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S RIGHT HAND - DUMMY HAND
      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.


197   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          197
      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

                              ASH (0.S.)

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      The hand picks up plates and begins breaking them over
      Ash's head.  Then a bottle.

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.

214   CLOSE SHOT - HAND - GELETIN HAND                      214

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

218   ANNIE'S POV                                           218

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE
               Excuse me.  This the road to the
               Knowby's cabin?

                              JAKE
               Thas' right.  But you ain't goin' there.

                              ANNIE
               And why not?


219   CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     219

      As he reaches in his truck to pull on the headlights.

      As they snap on.


221   MEDIUM SHOT - JAKE, ANNIE, AND ED                     221

      All stand in the bright glare of the lights as the fog
      swirls about them.  Annie and Ed gape in frightened
      wonder at what they see.


222   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT - (SIDE II) - (STUDIO MINIATURE)  222
      THEIR POV - TABLE TOP MODEL GIRDERS

      The piercing beams of light illuminate twisted remnants of
      the destroyed bridge that leads to the cabin.  A road sign,
      similar to the one on the other side of the bridge
      reads: "Dangerous Bridge - Two Ton Weight Limit".

                              ANNIE
               What happened?

                              JAKE
               Lady, I ain't never seen nothin' like
               it.

                              ED
               Terrific.  Now what?

                              ANNIE
               There must be another way in.
               Another road or something.


224   JAKE, BOBBY JOE, ANNIE AND ED - TWO CAMERAS           224

                              BOBBY JOE
               Sure ain't no, road.

      CAMERA pans over to reveal a brassy southern spitfire
      of a woman, Bobby Joe.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Hell you wanna go there for, anyway?

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs
      it into her mouth.  She doesn't like Annie and her
      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.


224X  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE AND ED                            224X

      Annie steps forward.  She eyes Bobby Joe.

                              ANNIE
               None of your business.


224Y  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224Y

      He feigns surprise and pleasantness.

                              JAKE
               Hey!  I just remembered... Yeah,
               that's right... There is a trail.
               You could follow Bobby Joe and me.

                              ED
               That sounds all right.

                              JAKE
               But, it'll cost ya.

                              ANNIE
               How much?

                              JAKE
               Forty Fi...


224A  ANGLE                                                 224A

      Jake looks up suddenly at Bobby Joe who gives
      a sharp shake of her head.

                              JAKE
               Hundred bucks.


224B  CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    224B

               you got a deal.


224C  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224C

      He glances through the window of Annie's car.


224D  JAKE'S POV                                            224D

      of the Dead, and a small handbag.


224E  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224E

      Looking back to Annie, a big smile on his near
      toothless face.

                              JAKE
               Sure!


225   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                    225

      A hiking trail winds through the woods.  Bobby Joe
      leads the way with flashlight in hand.  She pockets
      some bills.  She is followed by Annie and Ed who
      carry the glass case containing the missing pages
      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

                              JAKE
               Jesus H. Christ!  I thought she
               was talkin' 'bout them two goddamn
               little pieces!

      A large moon hangs in the night sky.


228   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          228
      CLOSE SHOT - EVIL HAND

      No longer attached to Ash's arm, it still writhes about
      beneath Ash's foot which pins it to the floor.


229   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - HAND'S POV - EYEMO W/ MOUNT       229

      As he grabs the steel wastebasket, dumps out the trash
      lowers it quickly over the CAMERA, trapping the hand
      within.


230   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     230

      With a note of finality, Ash slams down a pile of books
      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".


231   FIREPLACE                                             231

      Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been
      resting upon the coals.  He grits his teeth.


232   ANGLE                                                 232

      Just out of frame, Ash thrusts the glowing shovel against
      the stump to cauterize the wound.  Red steam hisses up
      into frame as Ash screams.


233   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     233

      He tosses aside the shovel and douses his smoldering
      stump into a vase of fresh flowers.


234   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      234

      Unspooling a roll of duct tape.


235   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     235

      He tapes the tablecloth into a makeshift bandage
      about his wrist.  Behind him, the wastebasket
      silently slides across the floor.


236   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     236

      "CLANG"! He turns to see.

      in the wall.

      He raises the shotgun and FIRES.  BLAM!  The floor
      next to the hand explodes.


249   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN THE WALL - SQUIB - EFX. HAND     249

      The hand leaps into the hole as a section of wall next
      to it EXPLODES.  Blam!


250   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      250

      Ash quickly reloads both chambers of the gun.
      He tracks the SOUND of the PITTER PATTER as the hand
      scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat.

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

                              ASH
               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its
      middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.


258   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               258

      He raises the gun, revealing his face as the
      CAMERA PANS UP with his movement.


259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.


260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260

      The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume.


261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261

      Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and
      3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      Terrified, he turns to more laughter.


276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.
      Ash turns.


276A  CLOSE SHOT                                            276A

      Other books upon the floor laugh.


277   MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                     277

      He turns sharply toward us and breaks into an
      uproariously frightening bout of laughter.


278   WIDE SHOT - ASH                                       278

      The wooden door behind Ash comes to life.  It
      stretches out as though it were elastic with each of
      its own low and terrible laughs.


279   WIDE SHOT - MAIN ROOM - TRACKING SHOT                 279
      RIGGING FOR TRAP DOOR, CABINETS, CLOCK

      Ash and everything in it are having the time of their
      lives.  Ash leads the bunch laughing harder and
      harder.


279A  MEDIUM SHOT - HAND HELD - FRONT DOOR AND ASH          279A

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

      The room's laughter suddenly stops.  Ash instantly
      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      with a creak revealing the empty night.

               These are my father's things.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

      earthen floor of the fruit cellar a half-rotten human
      head juts up!  Just the eyes are above the surface of the
      dirt.  They dart about wildly and halt upon Ash.  Worms
      crawl from the rotted forehead.

      She turns her twisted body to face Ash.  Moths fly
      about her in a flurry.

      of keys.

                              ANNIE

      With a sharp recoil, then spring, Henrietta makes a
      lunge at Ash.  Her face contorting, her teeth
      lengthening, her mouth opening impossibly wide
      as though she were going to swallow his head, and all as
      she lunges forward.  She changes to "Pee Wee" head.

      Ash leaps down upon the trapdoor, slamming it to pin

      champagne bottle.

      her back down into the cellar. The trap door shuts.
      Ash leaps atop it. The sound of Henrietta falling down

      ravings.  Ash quickly threads the chains through the
      eyeloops.

               resurrected from this book, is sure
               to come calling for me.

      The CAMERA takes the POV of the Evil Force as it
      glides through the woods. Over a stump, around the
      Oak trees, through a patch of fog, as the cabin comes
      into view.

               daylight.


347A  THE GROUP                                             347A

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.

               Let me out, dear.  It's so cold and dark
               in here.

                              ANNIE
               Mother?

                              HENRIETTA

      Annie starts to follow the instructions, but Ash halts
      her gently.  He shakes his head.  Annie snaps out of
      it.  She shakes her head and looks to the cellar.

                              ANNIE
               No.  No.  I don't know what you
               are but you're not my mother.

      Annie begins to cry.

                              ANNIE
               No!

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

      Confused and tearful, she screams to the others in the
      room.

                              ANNIE
               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

               Start up that saw and hand it here!
               We're gonna cut him up.

      Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body
      of Ed.  She is repulsed at the thought.

                              ANNIE
               No.

                              ASH

      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

               That trail we came in here on...
               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      Ash nods to Annie in a show of thanks.  He grabs the
      axe, and pushes open the door to the middle bedroom.
      Annie follows with the flickering oil lantern.

      The wind in the room suddenly stops.  He blows out his
      breath and watches it vaporize.  The screaming face of
      Raymond Knowby emerges from the wall.  A life like
      spirit made of swirling smoke and mist.

                              RAYMOND

      The ghost of Raymond points to Annie's glass case.

      Bobby Joe raises her hand into frame, to reveal Ash's
      Evil Hand clutched in hers.  Bobby Joe goes nuts,
      screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand
      from her.  She slams into the lantern, knocking it out.
      We lose them in the darkness.

      as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its

      eyes.  A large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping
      mouth dripping tree sap saliva.

      For the first time, she smiles at Ash.

                              ANNIE
               We've got it!

447A  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                           447A

      Annie reads through the pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

      the shotgun.  He points it at Ash and Annie.

               I'm runnin' the show now.

               find her, we're gettin' the hell
               outta here.

                              ASH
               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

                              JAKE
               You two comin' with me.  I ain't goin'
               out there alone.

                              ASH
               NO, YOU IDIOT.  You'll kill us all.
               She's dead by now.  With these pages
               we can...

      Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand.

                              JAKE
               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and
      Annie look on in horror.

                              JAKE
               'Sides.  Now you ain't got no, choice.

      Jake pushes at Ash with the barrel of the shotgun.

                              JAKE
               Now move!

      Ash hesitates.

                              JAKE
               Move you son of a bitch!

      All is quiet outside, no sign of Possessed Ash or
      Jake, and then Possessed Ash is there, emerging from
      the darkness suddenly.  He raises his finger and
      points to Annie.  He speaks in the low garbled voice
      of a demon:

                              POSSESSED ASH

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.


518   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               518

                              LINDA (V.O.)
               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The
      swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal.

                              ASH
               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.

               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      stands.

               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to
      his stump.

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS into Ash's face.

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the

      As the pee wee Head transformation continues, Henrietta's
      neck grows, like a jack in the box.  It extends
      a solid five feet upward, so that her head is now
      looking down upon Ash baring its teeth.

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.


605   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    605

                              ASH
               Swallow this.

      He pulls the trigger.  BLAM!  Flame barks from the gun.

      As rotten apple head is sucked out the doorway of the
      cabin.  The door slams shut behind it.  Its scream
      echoes off into the distance.

      The cabin becomes much more quiet.  The sounds of the
      trees are gone.  Ash looks to Annie.  She is dead.  Ash
      moves to her, strokes her hair and begins to cry.

                              ASH
                You did it.  By God you did it.

      He lowers his head and begins to heave in sharp
      convulsive breaths of despair.

      BLAST.  The door is sucked down into the rift.  All

      of the Book of the Dead.

      Objects come AT US from the distance and roar past, an
      uprooted tree, the grandfather clock with its hands
      winding backwards at an incredible rate, Ash spinning
      AT US, hand over foot, screaming.  The chainsaw still
      mounted to his wrist.

      sound of tweeting birds.  Ash's view of the serene sky
      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his
      line of sight.  Five armor-clad medieval WARRIORS
      stand directly over him.

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.

                             THE END
EVIL DEAD II

      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               spirits ruled the earth.

               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      TRACKING SHOT - ASH

      Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.
               And there it lay for 700 years...

      As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same
      castle which we saw earlier, but now, in a ruined state.
      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its
      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and
      toward the castle.

      TRACKING SHOT

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

               Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife,
               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small
               cabin where they could study it

      Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and
      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.

      down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and
      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.

      A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten

      He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and
      distraught.

					RAYMOND
               It has only been a few hours since
               I've translated and spoke aloud the first
               of the demon resurrection passages from
               the Book of the Dead.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO
      FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

					RAYMOND
               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this

      LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in
      the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan

      the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a
      delicate silver necklace.

      A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music
      on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash
      is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the
      melody with two fingers.

                              LINDA

      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the

      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,

41A   EXT. WOODS - DAWN                                     41A

      Ash, no longer possessed, collapses into the mud puddle,
      unconscious.


41B   EXT. WOODS - DAY - REVERSE ACTION - FOG - 3 ANGLES    41B

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the
      woods.  We hear the shriek of demons.  The sound of
      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      His eyes open.  They stare blankly up at the sky.  Then
      fear registers and we CRANE BACK QUICKLY, revealing a
      vast area of empty woods around Ash.


44    MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     44

      All is peaceful.  The sound of birds tweeting.

      A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare
      out at us with evil malice.  The eyes stare out from
      the two dark windows.  The dark nose area is the open
      doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the
      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.
      Then it fades, leaving only the cabin.

      Ash MOVES INTO A CLOSE UP.  His eyes shift back and forth
      like a trapped animal as he looks about for a means of
      escape.  He spots something.

      A narrow dirt road cutting through the woods. Then,
      the Delta 88 roars down it, and past the CAMERA.  It
      kicks up dust and gravel.

      Ash is driving.  He wipes the mud and blood from his
      face with a rag.  As he pulls the rag away, his face
      forms a sudden look of horror as he sees:

      CAR'S POV - TRACKING SHOT - STOP MOTION ANIMATION

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted
      remains of the steel and wood bridge that crossed
      a great mountain chasm.  A LOUD SCREECH of brakes
      is heard on the soundtrack on this cut.

      He looks at the bridge.

      ASH'S POV - BRIDGE

      A sign hangs from the twisted girders.  It reads:
      "DANGEROUS BRIDGE - 2 TON WEIGHT LIMIT - CROSS AT OWN
      RISK."  Beyond this we see the twisted remnants of the
      former bridge and the rock cliffs far away on the other
      side.

      To reveal Ash as he looks from the sunset, to the ruined
      bridge, to the road behind him.  He moves in halting
      steps, not knowing which way to turn.

      Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as
      he begins to scream, we CUT TO:

      As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain
      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to
      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it
      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      our vision of the "Road" ahead.  Our view suddenly
      clears, revealing a large tree that looms directly
      ahead.

      As he runs toward the cabin.  (Actually he is running
      in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly
      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the
      farther away from the cabin he gets.

      We race into the cabin, splintering the hall door
      which Ash had swung shut.  Ash retreats into the

      right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces
      as we glide forward.

      in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him
      as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and
      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin

      that sweeps through the cabin.  The CAMERA PANS down
      from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of

      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that

               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap

               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      CHEVROLET CAR TRUNK

      CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides
      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view
      of the boarded cabin in the distance.  It approaches.
      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.


152   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          152

      Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which
      lay upon the cabin floor.  Camera pans to window #1.
      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      As he stands and moves cautiously towards the rear
      bedroom.


154   ASH'S POV - MIDDLE ROOM AND REAR BEDROOM              154

      As he approaches the rear bedroom, the music grows louder.
      As he enters the room he halts his gaze on the old wooden
      piano.


155   INT. CABIN/REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT                       155
      MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.


156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      156

      As he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody.
      He recognizes the music.  It is the same music that Ash
      had played earlier, when Linda was dancing.


157   CLOSE SHOT - PIANO AND RADIATOR                       157

      As steam spouts from the radiator pipes.  As the piano
      keys depress and release themselves.  The melody grows
      louder.


158   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      158

      As he lowers his head.  His horror gives way to sadness.
      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      As they rip open, splintering Ash's reinforcements.
      Wind sweeps in through the place as the curtains flutter
      wildly.  Through the window is a sweeping fog.


162   INT. CABIN MIDDLE ROOM - NIGHT                        162

      Ash runs through this room and into the main room.  He
      moves to the window and looks out.  Wind blowing on his
      face from outside.

      The tiny figure of Ash can be seen looking off toward
      this hill.  In the foreground is a crude burial cross
      and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and
      splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed
      as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its
      feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the
      night air.

      (MINIATURE/STOP MOTION/REAR SCREEN) - 3 ANGLES

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      As it leaps through the air and gracefully situates
      itself atop Linda's neck, she begins to spin, yet her
      head remains in place, never taking her eyes from Ash.
      With a sensual twirl and leap, she disappears into the
      evening mists.

      Linda swings sharply into frame, completing the spin
      of her dance immediately in front of Ash as the music
      abruptly halts.

                              LINDA
               DANCE WITH ME!

      Linda extends her dead arms towards Ash.

      As he screams himself awake.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
      him sitting in the rocking chair.  Ash halts his scream,
      getting control of himself.  He looks to the window that
      had blown open.

               That's all.  Just a crummy dr-

      Linda's decapitated head falls into frame and lands in
      Ash's hands.


180   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             180

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Hello lover, I came from the other
               side of your dream to dance with you.


181   CLOSER SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD (BACKWARD MOTION)          181

      A four foot long blackened tongue emerges from her mouth
      like a lashing serpent.


182   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - (BACKWARD MOTION)                 182

      The tongue enters Ash's frame and forces itself into
      Ash's mouth.  Screaming as he clutches at the head of his
      former love.  The tongue instantly retracts inside her
      head.

      As Ash staggers painfully around the side of the
      cabin and towards the work shed; Linda's head still
      clamped to his hand.


187   INT. WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash
      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.  It is a room
      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.


187A  MEDIUM SHOT - INT. WORK SHED - ASH                    187A

      As he places Linda's head within the vice and
      tightens it around her, then withdraws his hand.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Even now we have your darling Linda's
               soul!  She suffers in torment!


187B  CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               187B

      As it rips away an old tarp revealing the chalk
      outline of where a chainsaw once was.


187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the
      chainsaw.  Behind him, the door to the shed bursts
      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.


187D  MEDIUM SHOT                                           187D

      Ash grabs a large crowbar and swings it
      toward the approaching blade.

      The crowbar hits the bottom of the blade with a
      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.


187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.


187G  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187G

187K  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD IN VICE                     187K

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.

      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.

187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.

      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.

      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.

      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S RIGHT HAND - DUMMY HAND
      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      Wind and fog swirl about the place.  Ash's ECHOING
      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

                              ASH (0.S.)
               Give me back my hand!!

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      The hand picks up plates and begins breaking them over
      Ash's head.  Then a bottle.


209   MEDIUM SHOT                                           209

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.


212   CLOSE-SHOT - HAND                                     212

      It digs its nails deep into the floorboards and begins to
      pull...


213   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     213

      ... as he is pulled along the kitchen floor.


214   CLOSE SHOT - HAND - GELETIN HAND                      214

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?


214A  ANGLE - ASH - COMEDY KNIFE RIG                        214A

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

      from the car.


218   ANNIE'S POV                                           218

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE
               Excuse me.  This the road to the
               Knowby's cabin?

                              JAKE
               Thas' right.  But you ain't goin' there.

      wonder at what they see.

      The piercing beams of light illuminate twisted remnants of

      similar to the one on the other side of the bridge
      reads: "Dangerous Bridge - Two Ton Weight Limit".

               Hell you wanna go there for, anyway?

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs
      it into her mouth.  She doesn't like Annie and her
      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.

               that's right... There is a trail.
               You could follow Bobby Joe and me.

               That sounds all right.

      leads the way with flashlight in hand.  She pockets
      some bills.  She is followed by Annie and Ed who
      carry the glass case containing the missing pages
      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

                              JAKE

      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".

      He tracks the SOUND of the PITTER PATTER as the hand
      scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat.

254   ASH'S POV - WALL - SQUIB                              254

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

                              ASH
               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its
      middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.


258   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               258

      He raises the gun, revealing his face as the
      CAMERA PANS UP with his movement.


259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.


260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260

      The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume.


261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261

      Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and
      3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.


261A  INSERT ASH'S FINGER PULLS THE FIRST, THEN             261A
      SECOND TRIGGER


261B  INSERT FLAME BELCHES FROM THE GUN TWICE               261B


262   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      262

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      Terrified, he turns to more laughter.


276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.
      Ash turns.


276A  CLOSE SHOT                                            276A

      Other books upon the floor laugh.


277   MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                     277

      He turns sharply toward us and breaks into an
      uproariously frightening bout of laughter.


278   WIDE SHOT - ASH                                       278

      The wooden door behind Ash comes to life.  It
      stretches out as though it were elastic with each of
      its own low and terrible laughs.


279   WIDE SHOT - MAIN ROOM - TRACKING SHOT                 279
      RIGGING FOR TRAP DOOR, CABINETS, CLOCK

      Ash and everything in it are having the time of their
      lives.  Ash leads the bunch laughing harder and
      harder.


279A  MEDIUM SHOT - HAND HELD - FRONT DOOR AND ASH          279A

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

      The room's laughter suddenly stops.  Ash instantly
      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      Ash opens the front door.  It slowly swings inward
      with a creak revealing the empty night.


283   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND JAKE                            283

      Ash approaches the front porch as Jake enters sharply
      into his frame.  Jake tackles Ash.

      Ed enters and holds Ash down as Jake slugs him twice.
      Ash's fist comes up into frame catching Jake on the
      jaw.  Jake pulls back his fist and rockets a piledriver
      blow to Ash's face, knocking him senseless.

      Joe's coat.  Bobby Joe is wounded from the shotgun blast.
      She holds her shoulder where the shell has grazed her.

                              JAKE
               You gonna be alright, honey?

                              BOBBY JOE

287   MEDIUM SHOT - JAKE, ED, ANNIE, AND BOBBY JOE          287

                              JAKE
               You know this son of a bitch?

                              ED

      Annie steps forward.

                              ANNIE
               Oh my God.  Where are my parents?

      Annie sets down the glass case containing the pages
      of the Book of the Dead.

      shirt and violently shakes him.

                              ANNIE
               What the hell did you do to them?

      Nursing his sore knuckles, he points with his elbow
      to the trap door that leads to the cellar.

               We'll throw him in there.

      with Jake.

                              ANNIE
               These are my father's things.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

                              PROFESSOR KNOWBY
                         (Voice on Tape)

      Ash's legs in the foreground.  Suddenly from the
      earthen floor of the fruit cellar a half-rotten human
      head juts up!  Just the eyes are above the surface of the
      dirt.  They dart about wildly and halt upon Ash.  Worms
      crawl from the rotted forehead.

      With a sharp recoil, then spring, Henrietta makes a
      lunge at Ash.  Her face contorting, her teeth

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.

               Let me out, dear.  It's so cold and dark
               in here.

                              ANNIE
               Mother?

                              ANNIE
               No.  No.  I don't know what you

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

      Ash exits the frame and we are left with Annie and the
      stark shadow of possessed Ed which is cast upon the
      wall behind her.  We watch as the shadow of Ash with the
      axe, slices through the top portion of possessed Ed's
      head.  Annie screams as she is splattered with green
      bile.

               Start up that saw and hand it here!
               We're gonna cut him up.

      Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body
      of Ed.  She is repulsed at the thought.

                              ANNIE
               No.

                              ASH

      Jake slowly stands into the empty frame. He is in shock
      from what he has just seen.  Annie slowly rises into
      frame - shaking her head in a silent "No." Ash slowly
      rises into frame, terrified. They are looking down at
      the out-of-frame remains of possessed Ed.

      Jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room.
      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

               That's funny.

                              BOBBY JOE

                              JAKE
               That trail we came in here on...
               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      She runs deep into the woods, still looking behind her
      as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its
      gnarled bark folds open to reveal very human like oversized
      eyes.  A large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping
      mouth dripping tree sap saliva.

                              TREE FACE
               BAHHHH!

               We gotta go out there and find
               her!

                              ASH
               If she went out in those woods,
               she's not coming back.

      Jake turns back to the window.  Ash turns to Annie.
      He glances down at the pages that Annie is looking over.


445A  ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT - PAGES AND ANNIE              445A

               What is it?

                              ASH
               Felt like someone just walked over my
               grave.  It's that picture.

      Annie looks to it.

               In 1300 AD.  This was the "Hero from
               the Sky," who was prophesized to destroy
               this Evil.

                              ASH
               He didn't do a very good job.
               What about the passages?


446   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    446

                              ANNIE
               Here it is.  Two passages.

      For the first time, she smiles at Ash.

      Annie reads through the pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

               find her, we're gettin' the hell
               outta here.

                              ASH
               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

                              JAKE
               You two comin' with me.  I ain't goin'
               out there alone.

                              ASH
               NO, YOU IDIOT.  You'll kill us all.
               She's dead by now.  With these pages
               we can...

      Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand.

                              JAKE
               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and
      Annie look on in horror.

                              JAKE
               'Sides.  Now you ain't got no, choice.

      Jake pushes at Ash with the barrel of the shotgun.

                              JAKE
               Now move!

      Ash hesitates.

      Annie enters the room.  She shudders from the
      cold.  CAMERA PANS with her glance to broken glass
      upon the floor, and over to reveal the bashed out
      window and the curtains fluttering in the wind.


509F  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE                                   509F

      appear suddenly in the foreground atop the writing desk.

514   ASH'S POV - STAR FILTER - MIRROR NECKLACE             514

      The NECKLACE of Linda.


517   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            517

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.


518   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               518

      As he slowly picks up the delicate silver necklace.
      He raises it to his face;

                              LINDA (V.O.)
               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      Ash raises his head and lets out a low, lamenting, and
      pitiful wail.  A man trapped in the shell of a beast,
      crying for the one he has lost.


520   MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH - 50% POSSESSED     520

      BLADDER EFX - 50 - 20% POSSESSED

      His face begins to change.  His skin loses its white
      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The
      swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal.

      again human.  Ash looks up suddenly with a start.


524   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                   524
      EXPLODING FLOOR

      As he rolls out of the way a moment before the head of
      the axe buries itself in the wooden floor.  Splinters
      fly.


525   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                   525
      EXPLODING WALL EFX

      Rolls to his feet and stands.  He ducks as Annie
      enters frame, charging him with axe, screaming.

                              ASH
               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.


526   CLOSER - ASH AND ANNIE                                526

      Ash grabs her tightly with his remaining hand.

                              ASH
               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      Ash pushes her away.  Annie falls to the floor.  She
      stands.


527   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                    527
      EXPLODING WALL EFX

      Catching his wind for a moment.  Then rolls to the
      side as the axe again comes at him!  SLAM!  The head
      of the axe slices into the wall only a few inches from
      his head.


528   MED. SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                             528

      backwards.

                              ASH
               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH
               You'll be the first to know.
               I'm fine.

               Yeah, but for how long?
               If we're going to beat this thing,
               we need those pages.

      As he turns to the trap door.

               Then let's head down into that cellar...


529B  CLOSE SHOT - TRAP DOOR                                529B

      It lies silently against the floor.  A rasping
      breath can be heard from below.


529C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      529C

      He turns from the trap door to Annie.

               ...And carve ourselves a witch.

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to
      his stump.

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

      ANNIE'S POV

      Looking down into the cellar.  No sign of Henrietta.
      The bottom of the steps disappear into blackness.

                              ASH
               Those pages are down there
               somewhere.

      He looks about the dark corners of the cellar trying
      to find some sign of Henrietta or the pages.

      Panning the cobwebs and dark stone walls of the cellar.
      Half hidden in the shadows we see two of the missing
      pages.

      spots another page somewhat deeper into the cellar.


575B  ASH'S POV                                             575B

      A fourth and fifth page lay upon the earthen floor, at
      the base of the cellar's rear door.


575C  ASH - CLOSE SHOT                                      575C

      Ash moves to pages and gathers them.

      Annie's voice calls down.

                              ANNIE (O.S.)
               Did you find her?


576   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      576

                              ASH
               She's playing hard to get...

      He pumps the throttle on the buzzing saw.

                              ASH
               ... rid of.

      Behind Ash, unseen by him, a shadow darts by.


577   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      577

      It is coming from the door to the cellar's rear room.


577B  ANGLE - ASH                                           577B

      He reaches for the door and opens it.  Revealing
      darkness beyond.  Ash enters.  Again he hears the slight
      sound, a gentle ticking.


578   INT. CELLAR - REAR ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV           578

      The ticking sound is coming from behind a hanging drape.


579   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     579

      He approaches the drape, reaches out his hand and pulls
      it back sharply.  Revealing an old water heater, ticking
      and steaming.


579A  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     579A

      He breathes a sigh of relief as the half eaten skeleton
      torso of Ed falls atop him!  Ash screams and steps suddenly
      away.


579B  ASH'S POV                                             579B

      wrapped in the bloody sheet.

                         (In a whisper)
               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the
      remaining pages from the Book of the Dead.  Getting
      scared now, he backs into the cellar's front room.


579D  INT. CELLAR - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT - ASH                579D

581   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET                               581

      As they climb. From behind the wooden steps, the
      horrible head of Henrietta appears.  Her two rotting hands
      grab at Ash's ankles.


582   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      582

      He looks down with a scream.

               Come to me.  Come to sweet
               Henrietta!

      Her face pulls back behind the cellar steps.  Her
      hands pull ASH's feet in after her.


584   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - CAMERA RIG                        584

      As Ash falls, he slams his jaw down upon the bottom

      moans, and looks towards the steps.


590   ASH'S POV - THE WOODEN STAIRCASE (REVERSE ACTION)     590

      As she kneels down at the trapdoor, about to call down
      to Ash when the witchlike figure of Henrietta floats
      quickly up into the main room from the cellar.  A
      flurry of moths about her.

                              HENRIETTA
               Free!  Free at last!

      is clutching at Annie's hair and laughing with a demonic
      malice, as she spins about the room in mid air.


594   CLOSE SHOT - TRAP DOOR - ANNIE'S FEET                 594

      Ash's bloodied arm slings itself over the edge of the

      As the pee wee Head transformation continues, Henrietta's
      neck grows, like a jack in the box.  It extends
      a solid five feet upward, so that her head is now
      looking down upon Ash baring its teeth.

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.


605   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    605

                              ASH
               Swallow this.

      He pulls the trigger.  BLAM!  Flame barks from the gun.

      Dust is falling about them.  The cabin walls are
      starting to break apart.  There is a tremendous "Voyage

      and Annie stagger for footing.

      on the surface of a giant oak is revealed, as it peeks
      in through the window at them.

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.

                             THE END
EXCALIBUR

               FADE IN:

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Darkness. The sound of battle cries and the clang of metal 
               upon metal. The forest lights up with huge sparks flying 
               from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each 
               other. Mounted knights collide head-on at full gallop, their 
               armor made incandescent in the clash. Sparks eddy in their 
               wakes and float to the ground. The forest catches fire.

               MAIN TITLES on the flames. Out of the sounds of ancient battle 
               grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with 
               melancholy.

               Two crazed eyes reflect the fire. The eyes belong to a man 
               without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; 
               his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge. 
               So close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair 
               sizzles alight. He slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying 
               insect. He wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver. It is 
               Merlin. The wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, 
               dodging the combatants, searching.

                                     MERLIN
                         Lord Uther! Lord Uther!

               The forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow 
               slaughter. Patches of undergrowth are smoldering. Small flames 
               lick bark and branches.

               Smoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of 
               the dying and the dead.

               A huge knight reins up beside Merlin on a lathered horse. 
               His armor is blood spattered. He is weary from battle. He 
               looks down at Merlin, his countenance fierce. The blade of 
               his sword glows with an unnatural aura.

                                     MERLIN
                         It's done. A truce. We meet at the 
                         river.

                                     UTHER
                              (disgusted)
                         Talk. Lovers murmuring to each 
                         other...

               EXT. RIVER, FOREST - DAY

               Waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the 
               forest is a warlord, the Duke of Cornwall. He is flanked by 
               his armored warriors. Lot of Lowthean prominent among them. 
               They are battle-weary and bloodied, but they look ready to 
               fight. Behind them is an army of lesser knights.

               To the opposite bank come Uther and Merlin, a much smaller 
               force of knights, including Uryens, Lord of Gore, surrounding 
               them.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         I spit on your truce, Uther. If you 
                         want peace, throw down your swords.

               Uther and the Duke of Cornwall glare at each other in silence 
               across the river. Uther strains forward, burning with anger; 
               but Merlin restrains him.

                                     UTHER
                         I should butcher all and every one 
                         of them. Merlin, what is this wagging 
                         of tongues?

                                     MERLIN
                         Just show the sword.

               Uther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the 
               air high over his head. The blade hums disquietingly and 
               leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. The marvel 
               instills dread in all present.

                                     MERLIN
                              (waxing eloquent)
                         Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. 
                         Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, 
                         before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf 
                         to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to 
                         Thor himself and that was when the 
                         world was young and there were more 
                         than seven colors in the rainbow.
                              (and in an aside to 
                              Uther)
                         Speak the words.

                                     UTHER
                              (bellowing)
                         One land, one king! That is my peace!

               The Duke of Cornwall looks around nervously as some of his 
               knights fall to their knees in awe.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword 
                         of power, what will you yield?

                                     UTHER
                         Me, yield!?

               Merlin urges Uther hard.

                                     MERLIN
                              (a whisper)
                         He has given. Now you must.

               The two knights glare at each other, rage contending with 
               anger.

                                     UTHER
                         The land from here to the sea is 
                         yours if you will enforce the King's 
                         will.

               The enemies lock eyes and Merlin watches anxiously.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         Done!

               All men from both sides break out in wild cheers.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         My Lord King Uther, let us feast 
                         together. To my castle. Lord Merlin, 
                         you must join -

               But Merlin is nowhere in sight.

               INT. TINTAGEL CASTLE - HALL - NIGHT

               Drums and wailing flutes fill the banquet hall with a lusty 
               rhythm. Armored warriors watch a lone woman dancing. She is 
               very beautiful, both sensuous and innocent.

               Uther sits at the long table beside the Duke of Cornwall 
               with the barons and dukes of the land, and the lesser knights. 
               The table is stained with wine and littered with bones and 
               half-eaten fruit.

               Uther's eyes burn with lust as he watches the dancer.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         I would wish you such a wife, Lord 
                         Uther, as my Igrayne. So innocent, 
                         but in bed, a furnace...

               The Duke rises and goes to his wife, be-striding the center 
               of the hall and Igrayne weaves circles of dance around him. 
               He gloats with pride.

               The words escape his lips:

                                     UTHER
                         I must have her.

               Lot spins to face him.

                                     LOT
                         What? You're mad! What about the 
                         alliance?

                                     UTHER
                              (oblivious)
                         I must have her.

                                     LOT
                         And risk all you've won? This castle 
                         commands the sea gate to the kingdom.

               Uther is not one for politics, and Lot's words sail past 
               him. The King lusts for Igrayne.

               A bell is struck not far away. The music ceases and the hall 
               falls silent. The great door creaks open, revealing the dawn 
               light, and a monk steps into the hall and waits by it. Muffled 
               by corridors of stone, a choir of monks can now be heard 
               singing the high, ecstatic harmonies of the Te Deum. Those 
               who have fallen asleep at the table are roused, those drunk, 
               helped up.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN

               The monk leads the party down the hallway of the castle. 
               Thin shafts of dawnlight filter through archers' slits in 
               the thick walls onto stone floors. Otherwise, it is dark. 
               Each person, lady and knight, proceeds alone, head bent, 
               some crossing themselves.

               Uther is among them. He stops in a dark alcove, breathing 
               heavily, waiting.

               As the lovely Igrayne drifts past him, he pulls her out of 
               sight of the others.

               In a shaft of pale light Uther clasps Igrayne to his 
               breastplate, his iron arm wrapped around her frail body. So 
               violent is his embrace that she cannot breathe, her mouth is 
               wide with fear, and her feet do not touch the ground; an 
               impaled butterfly.

                                     UTHER
                         You will be mine. Wife and queen, 
                         bed and crown.

               His face is close to hers, looking as though he would devour 
               her tender whiteness with his kiss. She doesn't answer; she 
               can't. Even Uther understands this and lets her go.

                                     IGRAYNE
                              (a fierce whisper)
                         I want no other crown and no other 
                         bed than those I have.

               Her gown and her fragile skin torn on the spikes of his armor, 
               Igrayne backs away and joins the procession.

               Uther trembles with unreleased passion.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN

               Igrayne enters the candlelit chapel from which issues the 
               chant, calling the castle to worship. She rushes to her 
               husband's side, kneeling next to him and whispering. The 
               Duke of Cornwall looks back at Uther, hatred in his eyes.

               EXT. WAR CAMP - BEFORE TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAY

               Uther is in a towering rage. Sword drawn, he stalks among 
               the biers of fallen knights. Squires and clerics keep a 
               healthy distance. The sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling 
               thunder. Beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out 
               of the sea stands the impregnable Tintagel Castle, seat of 
               the Duke of Cornwall, now under siege.

                                     UTHER
                              (bellowing in all 
                              directions)
                         Merlin! Where are you!?

               Just then a knight rides up and dismounts. It is Ulfius, a 
               lieutenant.

                                     UTHER
                         Have you found him?

                                     ULFIUS
                         No--

               But he cannot finish. He is taken aback by the sudden 
               appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a 
               beggar's pan.

                                     HAG
                         What a hurry you were in this morning, 
                         good sir. You forgot to give this 
                         old woman a coin.

                                     ULFIUS
                         I saw you half a day's gallop from 
                         here. I asked you if you had seen 
                         Merlin. I returned here straight 
                         away. How did -

                                     HAG
                         --I heard. I have come. I am also 
                         Merlin.

               The figure straightens, the filthy rags become a flowing 
               cape, and the hair is swept back by the wind, andóit is 
               Merlin, laughing.

                                     MERLIN
                         I have walked my way since the 
                         beginning of time. Sometimes I give, 
                         sometimes I take. It is mine to know 
                         which, and when.

                                     UTHER
                              (exploding)
                         Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.

               Ulfius edges away.

                                     MERLIN
                         I know the storm inside you, and 
                         what it has wrought. The alliance I 
                         forged is wrecked.

               The Duke of Cornwall under siege. All this for lust. Selfish 
               lust.

               Uther grabs Merlin.

                                     UTHER
                         For Igrayne. One night with her. Do 
                         it. Use the magic.

               Merlin frowns pensively, his gaze searching strange distances 
               and wandering; then focusing, blazing straight at Uther.

                                     MERLIN
                         You will swear by your true kingship 
                         to grant me what I wish. Then you 
                         shall have it.

               Uther kneels and draws his sword and holds it up by the blade, 
               a cross.

                                     UTHER
                         I swear it. By Excalibur and the 
                         holy--

                                     MERLIN
                         --What issues from your lust will be 
                         mine. Swear it again.

                                     UTHER
                         I swear it.

               Merlin looks down sorrowfully at the kneeling King.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, TINTAGEL CASTLE - EVENING

               The Duke of Cornwall watches a force of armored knights riding 
               forth from Uther's war camp, with banners flying. It passes 
               beneath the castle and on toward a distant cliff.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                              (to a lieutenant)
                         It's Uther and all his best knights. 
                         He leaves behind little more than 
                         fledglings to guard his camp.

               His eyes are as cold and as pale as ice.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT

               Uther and his knights, and Merlin on a mule, ride to the 
               high promontory and dismount. Here, overlooking the sea, is 
               a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and 
               hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans 
               and sighs.

               The knights watch as Merlin and Uther, leading his horse, 
               walk toward the stones. Merlin strides into the circle, 
               turning to look at Uther, who hesitates.

                                     MERLIN
                         Come.

               Uther starts to make the sign of the cross, but Merlin halts 
               him with a gesture. Uther's hand drops, and he enters the 
               circle with his horse.

               Merlin and Uther look out across the sea, to Tintagel Castle 
               high upon the cliff.

               Merlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, 
               and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he 
               marries to the roaring and whining of the wind. The wind 
               becomes stronger, and Merlin's incantations become more 
               intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still. Until 
               Merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind 
               buffets his slight frame.

               And then, for all to understand:

                                     MERLIN
                         I hold the balance of all things in 
                         my summoning. Arise mists. Come fog.

               EXT. VISTA FROM THE CLIFF - TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT

               From the horizon a front of fog advances toward the castle 
               to envelop it, and continues across the gulf to the circle 
               of stones.

               EXT. GATE, TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT

               The portal opens and a small force of armored men, led by 
               the Duke of Cornwall, exits. A fog is thickening all around 
               them.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT

               The advancing front envelops Merlin and Uther, eddying around 
               the stones.  All else is obliterated.

                                     MERLIN
                         Mount your horse.

               The King does.

                                     MERLIN
                         Ride straight to the castle, across 
                         the sea of fog.

               Uther spurs straight for the edge of the cliff, then reins 
               in his horse abruptly.

                                     UTHER
                         But the cliff, the sea...

               Merlin rages, crazed.

                                     MERLIN
                         Ride across! Across the bridges of 
                         desire. Your lust will hold you up. 
                         For I have just woven it into the 
                         fabric of the world. This is magic - 
                         making solid what is in the mind, 
                         and unsolid, that which is already 
                         solid.

               He gives the horse a stinging blow with his staff.

               The horse and Uther charge forward into a gallop and stepping 
               off where the hidden edge of the cliff would be, hoofbeats 
               ceasing and the horse dropping for the blink of an eye, they 
               gallop across the fog.

               EXT. MERLIN'S FOG

               Galloping on no visible terrain, Uther and his horse advance 
               through the restless fog, and as they recede rider and animal 
               become a wavering, changeable form within the cloud.

               EXT. GATE, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Horse and rider pull up at the gate.

                                     RIDER
                              (calling)
                         Wake up in there. It is I.

               If it was not for the electric blue hue burning in the eyes 
               of the man entering the castle, the same magic hue that 
               Excalibur left upon the air when wielded, the resemblance to 
               the Duke if Cornwall would be perfect.

               After a moment the portal opens.

               INT. INNER GATE, INTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               He passes into an inner court, the portal closing behind. 
               Armed men emerge cautiously. Thinking that it is their Duke 
               they help him dismount.

                                     'DUKE' OF CORNWALL
                         Have the horse ready. I ride out 
                         before sunrise.

               An inner gate opens and the 'Duke' goes through it.

               EXT. UTHER'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               The real Duke and his men ride through the fogbound camp, 
               cutting the ropes of the tents, stabbing the men trapped 
               beneath the canvas. When a frightened crow flies squawking 
               into the face of the Duke's horse, which rears. He is unhorsed 
               and falls, and impales himself on a tent stake.

               Dying, the true Lord of Tintagel Castle rises and staggers 
               forward, blood pumping from him.

               INT. CHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               A little girl of four awakens from a nightmare, a small lone 
               figure in her canopied bed. Her eyes are ice, like her 
               father's.

                                     MORGANA
                         Papa... Papa...

               Igrayne is soon at her side, lifting the child from the bed, 
               holding her tight.

                                     MORGANA
                         My father is dead...

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               The 'Duke' enters. The room is empty, but the door to 
               Morgana's room is open.

               INT. MORGANA'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The 'Duke' stands in the doorway. Igrayne herself is 
               surprised.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         Look, here is your father. It was 
                         just a dream, little one.

                                     'DUKE' OF CORNWALL
                         Come Igrayne.

               Igrayne kisses Morgana, tucks her in and returns to her own 
               room, closing the door. The child doesn't know whether to 
               believe the truth of the dream or the waking truth.

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               In full armor, the 'Duke' bears down on the naked Igrayne on 
               her marriage bed. She stares at him, wondering. But his eyes 
               are closed, and finally he carries her in his wild passion, 
               her white limbs tangling around the lustre of his armor.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - NIGHT

               And Merlin is jolted awake from deep within himself, coming 
               out of a trance.

                                     MERLIN
                         It is done. The future has found 
                         root in the present.

               He lifts himself up on his staff. He stands in the midst of 
               the ancient stones, bristling with excitement. Uther's mighty 
               knights are asleep, a deep unnatural sleep, huddled together 
               and surrounded by their horses. And then Merlin swoons, 
               collapsing to the ground.

               INT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN

               His lieutenants deposit the Duke of Cornwall's bloodless 
               body upon the long table. His eyes are wide open, icy and 
               cunning even in death. The ladies of the castle support and 
               comfort the grief-stricken Igrayne as she approaches the 
               body of her husband. Morgana hangs onto her mother's gown.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         When did it happen? Where?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         In the camp of Uther, my lady, just 
                         after nightfall.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         It can't be. He came to me, to his 
                         bed, last night.

                                     LADY
                         It was his spirit, yearning for you 
                         in his hour of death, that visited 
                         you.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         His spirit?

               Pale with grief, Igrayne stares at her dead husband in 
               silence.

               Then her hand drifts to her stomach. When she talks again, 
               undone and resolved, it is to all and herself:

                                     IGRAYNE
                         Tintagel Castle falls to Uther. But 
                         what shall become of me, and the 
                         child I bear?

               Morgana shows no distress. She runs her baby hands across 
               her father's face and closes his eyes. The intensity that 
               was frozen in them is now added to her own pale and cunning 
               eyes.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - DAY

               Merlin has been propped up against one of the stones. He is 
               in a deep trance and Uther is attempting to shake him awake.

                                     UTHER
                         I want her, Merlin. I cannot be 
                         without her. Tintagel is mine. Can I 
                         take her now? Tell me!

               Merlin's eyes open but he sees nothing, and only a puzzling 
               squeal issues from him.

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE- EVENING

               Morgana watches from a corner. The ladies of the castle 
               surround Igrayne who is giving birth.

               Noisy crows alight on the windowsill. Only Morgana notices.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Uther strides to Igrayne's bedchamber, his warrior knights 
               following. He is dirty and his iron dress is blood-spattered.

                                     UTHER
                              (bellowing)
                         Three horses died under me, so hard 
                         did I spur them here. Is it born? Is 
                         it alive?

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               At his approach and entrance the ladies shrink back, and 
               Morgana edges closer to her mother, and seats herself on the 
               bed beside her. Ingrain holds her newborn baby in her arms, 
               the blood of birth still wet upon it.

                                     UTHER
                         Out!

               The ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to 
               Igrayne.

                                     UTHER
                         What is it, lady?

               Terrified of him, Igrayne faces him the best she can.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         A boy, sir. Rest yourself.

               Uther waves away her words but does sit down on the bed, 
               exhausted. He notices Morgana, who stares at him.

                                     UTHER
                         Send the girl away.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         She is just a child -

                                     UTHER
                         Out!

               Igrayne draws the child to her and kisses her cheek.

                                     IGRAYNE
                              (whispering)
                         Go now. Come back later.

               The child leaves silently, hatred in her eyes.

                                     UTHER
                         She watches me with her father's 
                         eyes.

               He grasps the newborn baby with his iron hand, and pulls it 
               to himself. He looks upon it with wonder, with a gentleness 
               that is unexpected.

                                     UTHER
                         Igrayne, is he mine, or -

               He can't bring himself to say his name. She hesitates on the 
               edge of tears, worried for the infant lying in its iron 
               cradle.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         The night he died, a man loved me 
                         with great fierceness. He looked 
                         like my husband, spoke like, smelled 
                         like, felt like my own husband. But 
                         it was not he, for he was already 
                         dead. It wasn't his spirit, for this 
                         child, who was conceived that night, 
                         is flesh and blood. I know nothing 
                         more.

               Uther draws a dagger. He lifts it.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         No--

               But he uses it before Igrayne can move. He severs the leather 
               thongs that bind the iron breastplate to his chest. He casts 
               it to the floor. His chest is smooth and milk-white in 
               striking contrast to his creased, weathered face. And beaming, 
               he holds the baby to it.

                                     UTHER
                         Through him, I will learn to love 
                         them, for I am tired of battle. I 
                         will stay by his side and
                              (looking shyly at 
                              Igrayne)
                         his mother's...

               Igrayne's hatred for the man is at the very edge of becoming 
               love. The baby starts to cry.

                                     UTHER
                         Here. It's hungry.

               And his free hand opens her shift, and he holds a swollen 
               breast in his gloved hand, squeezing gently. Milk bubbles 
               from it and he thrusts the baby's mouth onto it.

               Igrayne weeps and Uther watches proudly as the baby suckles.

               Merlin advances from the window, his cape the same iridescent 
               green-black as the feathers of the crows that were perched 
               by the window.

                                     UTHER
                         Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at 
                         last.

                                     MERLIN
                         Doing what I did for you, it wasn't 
                         easy, you know. It takes it's toll. 
                         It took nine moons to get back my 
                         strength.

               Uther avoids looking at him.

                                     MERLIN
                         Now you must pay me.

                                     UTHER
                         I?

                                     MERLIN
                         The child is mine, Uther. I have 
                         come for him.

               Uther is shaken to his roots. Igrayne watches, trying to 
               understand.

                                     UTHER
                         The oath. You didn't say--

                                     MERLIN
                         You didn't ask!

                                     IGRAYNE
                         Uther, is it true? Don't let him 
                         take the child.

                                     UTHER
                         I swore an oath, Igrayne. I made a 
                         pact with Merlin.

               Igrayne suddenly understands. She glares at Uther.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         It was you? You came to me that night. 
                         You are the father.

               Uther is caught, and turns to Merlin who is harsh and 
               unswaying.

                                     MERLIN
                         It's not for you, Uther, hearth and 
                         home, wife and child.

                                     UTHER
                         To kill and be king, is that all?

                                     MERLIN
                         Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought 
                         once that you were the one to unite 
                         the land under one sword. But it'll 
                         take another, a greater king...

                                     UTHER
                         You strike me with words as hard as 
                         steel.

                                     MERLIN
                         They are not weapons, my friend, but 
                         truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole 
                         his wife and took his castle, now no 
                         one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your 
                         allies will turn against you. Give 
                         me the child, Uther, I will protect 
                         him. Go back to your war tent.

               Uther wrenches the baby from it's mother's breast and hands 
               him to Merlin.

                                     UTHER
                              (in torment)
                         By the oath, take the devil child. 
                         Take him!

               With the bawling baby under his cape, Merlin exits. Igrayne 
               pulls herself out of the bed, weak, her legs giving under 
               her. She starts after Merlin.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         WHY?... Why must he have the baby?

               Uther stops her with his bulk and she claws savagely at his 
               chest to get past him. He weeps as he folds his arms around 
               her.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               As Merlin walks through the castle, the baby crying in his 
               arms, the knights and ladies step back, afraid to intervene 
               in royal matters.

               INT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT.

               Merlin comes across the empty banquet hall, cooing to the 
               baby, strangely pacifying him. Morgana steps out of the 
               shadows in his path, and Merlin stops at the sight of the 
               little girl, her pale eyes glaring at him.

               She speaks haltingly and clearly while far-off Igrayne cries 
               out her distress.

                                     MORGANA
                         Merlin, are you now the father, and 
                         the mother, of the baby?

               Staring at her, Merlin shudders and without answering he 
               continues away, faster now, and into an unlit passageway, 
               disappearing from sight a bit sooner than an ordinary mortal 
               would have.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The forest is dark and shiny with rain. An unseen battle 
               rages.

               The first combatant in sight is Uther, who swings the mighty 
               Excalibur, cutting an attacker in half at the waist. Uther 
               and a small force of knights, Ulfius among them, are 
               retreating through the slippery wet forest, completely 
               outnumbered.

               Lord Lot of Lowthean and Lord Uryens of Gore are the leaders 
               of the attack.

                                     URYENS
                              (to his men)
                         The King's sword. I must have it.

               Ulfius and his men stand their ground so the King may escape 
               the onslaught. They are hacked down.

               Uther flees alone, severing the limbs of any man and tree 
               that stands in his way.

               EXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY

               Uther has gained on his pursuers. He comes to a small clearing 
               where the spine of a buried boulder rises through the forest 
               floor. He stops upon it, breathing hard, dripping blood. He 
               rages aloud, but his throat is raw and cracked and only a 
               whisper comes out.

                                     UTHER
                         Merlin, where are you? To weave a 
                         mist, to hide us...

               He hears his pursuers closing in.

                                     UTHER
                         No one shall have the sword. No one 
                         shall wield Excalibur but me.

               He holds it by the hilt with both hands, the blade pointing 
               to the ground of stone. He flexes his knees. He lifts up his 
               hands above his head. And with all the strength that rage 
               and pain can muster, and more, he drives the blade of 
               Excalibur into the stone, nearly to the hilt. His mouth widens 
               in an awful silent scream, and then the foam of saliva pink 
               with blood issues from deep within him, so violent was his 
               effort.

               As the sword cuts into the rock, the earth shudders.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The forest quakes. The knights searching for Uther halt in 
               fear.

               EXT. FIELDS, WOODS - DAY

               And far away, a caped figure is crossing a field toward a 
               wood, when the earth shakes, stirring animals and birds. The 
               man turns. He is Merlin, the two day-old baby peeking from 
               his cape. Merlin is amazed at the phenomenon, he puts his 
               ear to a rock protruding from the earth.

                                     MERLIN
                         Into the spine of the dragon!
                              (and then he is 
                              saddened)
                         Uther... I loved you, mighty child.

               And tears welling, and giggling at the same time, he whisks 
               away into the woods.

               EXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY

               Uther staggers away, colliding with trees, staggering, 
               crashing to the ground. Until the only life left in him is 
               the coursing of his blood, flowing from his gaping mouth 
               onto the leaves on the forest floor.

               The enemy knights advance through the trees. They prod at 
               the fallen leviathan, they roll him over to get at his 
               scabbard. Only then do they see the sword in the stone, and 
               they stop, amazed and afraid. Their captains appear. Uryens 
               sees what they are staring at, and races to the sword and 
               attempts to pull it out.

               He strains with all his might, but it is immovable.

                                     LOT
                         Let me.

               He shoves Uryens aside, but he can't loosen the sword either, 
               and he rages with frustration.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               LEGEND APPEARS:

               "Fifteen years passed and the land was without a king."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. FIELDS - DAY

               Peasants spill over the crest of a hill. They are fleeing a 
               force of armored knights, their plumed helmets forged in the 
               semblance of predatory animals. The knights thunder past the 
               peasants, trampling the ripening crops. Sir Uryens is their 
               leader, his hard face indifferent to the havoc he leaves in 
               his wake.

               The peasants watch in mute anger.

               EXT. FARMYARD - EVENING

               Sir Lot leading another group of mounted knights comes 
               galloping into a small hamlet, panicked chickens and pigs 
               scattering at their approach. The farmers run for their lives 
               as the steel men dismount, leading their horses to water and 
               hay, and searching for vittles. A knight spots a woman who 
               stands frozen with fear, and he drags her into the barn as 
               her crying child watches.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

               A farmhouse is burning nearby, and three mounted figures 
               make their way along a trail at a walking pace - an old knight 
               in leather and mail, a young knight proud in gleaming new 
               armor; and on a farm horse, a squire with baggage and jousting 
               lance. The old knight, Sir Ector, is troubled by what he 
               sees.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         It is a dark hour... everywhere 
                         lawlessness and destruction, and no 
                         one to lead us out of it.

               Just then, ten crazed peasants emerge from the darkness, 
               hurling stones and armed with clubs and pronged sticks. They 
               surround the three riders. Sir Ector wheels around and slices 
               the air with his sword to ward off the ambushers.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Listen all. I am Sir Ector of Morven 
                         and these are my sons. You would 
                         wrong me, for I have never stolen 
                         from others, or destroyed the fruit 
                         of the land.

               The peasants edge closer, working up the nerve to rush the 
               horsemen. The sound of thundering hooves cuts through the 
               clamor.

               A cavalcade of riders, armor gleaming in the moonlight, 
               advances across the fields at a gallop. Immediately the 
               peasants scatter. The old knight is on the verge of tears.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         The people's anger is just. It is 
                         sad that for our own safety, we will 
                         have to ride to the tournament with 
                         these robber knights.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - SUNRISE

               Red with the first light of day, Excalibur rests in the stone 
               as King Uther left it. The field is itched with tents, each 
               flying its heraldic banner. Knights and squires are 
               everywhere, preparing horses and armor for the joust. A burly 
               man in religious robes harangues the crowd, vying for 
               attention.

                                     BISHOP
                         This is Easter day, when Christ rose 
                         again. Who will find strength in 
                         victory of arms? Who will draw the 
                         sword?

               The Bishop goes among the tents, through the teeming throng, 
               solemnly casting holy water upon man and horse, armor and 
               banner. The knights kneel at the Bishop's transit, but 
               ceremony does not lift the air of grimness that lies over 
               the event.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND, SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Their armor ablaze with sunlight, two mounted knights thunder 
               toward each other at full gallop, lowering their long jousting 
               lances. As they meet, the lance of each knight is deflected 
               by the shield of the other. A gasp goes through the crowd, 
               and the two knights charge past each other. They wheel around 
               at the end of the jousting ground and go at each other again 
               from the other direction. Again lances strike, and this time 
               one of the men is hit in the chest and violently unhorsed. 
               The crowd cheers.

               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               The victor, Leondegrance, rides up to the stone and dismounts. 
               Each great knight with his coterie of lesser knights comes 
               to watch. A charge of expectation is in the air, although 
               most knights are glowering with envy.

               Leondegrance of Camelyarde ascends to the sword, grabs it by 
               the hilt, and begins to tug with all his might. Excalibur is 
               immovable. The moment of tension passes. Leondegrance staggers 
               toward his waiting squires, who lead him away. All the others 
               return to the battle sport.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               At the edge of the jousting ground Sir Ector's son Sir Kay 
               is getting ready for a bout. His brother Arthur is buckling 
               the new armor while his father fusses about him, making small 
               adjustments when he notices that Kay's scabbard is empty. He 
               turns to Arthur and grab's him by the ear.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Arthur, where is Kay's sword? A good 
                         squire doesn't forget his knight's 
                         sword.

               The fifteen year-old boy blushes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I left it in the tent, sir.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Well hurry then, and get it.

               The boy dashes off as Sir Ector shakes his head, not without 
               affection beneath the sternness.

               EXT. TENTS - DAY

               Arthur runs in search of their tent. He finds it.

               INT. TENT - DAY

               He enters. The saddle trunk has been emptied on the floor, 
               equipment is scattered all over. Arthur is shocked, 
               nonetheless he rummages madly. Finally he stops, on the verge 
               of tears.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It's been stolen....

               EXT. TENTS - DAY

               He comes out, utterly defeated, and frantic. He stops by two 
               knights who are arguing angrily; and one of them has left 
               his sword in the grass.

               Arthur looks at it. He is tempted to steal it, but he can't. 
               Head down, he wanders off.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               Sir Ector and Sir Kay are waiting.

                                     SIR KAY
                         Father, I'll go and see what's keeping 
                         him.

               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Arthur stops at the edge of the dark forest, totally dejected, 
               when he sees the sword in the stone. He walks up to it, his 
               face lighting up, brimming with innocence. He is alone, as 
               everyone has returned to the jousting ground.

                                     ARTHUR
                         If only Kay could have it...

               He smiles, forgetting his troubles, a boy again living in a 
               fairy tale. He grasps the sword by the hilt and it comes 
               away easily from its stone lock.

               Not expecting it to, he nearly falls. He stares at it, 
               terribly excited and surprised: he tucks it under his arm 
               and rushes back.

               EXT. TENTS - DAY

               He bumps into Kay.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (breathless)
                         Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here 
                         is Excalibur. Is it too late? I 
                         hurried--

               Kay takes it. He cannot believe what he's holding in his 
               hands. He starts to talk but he is so agitated he can only 
               stutter.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               Kay, with Arthur in tow, rushes to Sir Ector and shows him 
               the sword; he trembles with excitement.

                                     SIR KAY
                         Look, Father. Excalibur. Does that 
                         mean that I am to be king?

               Sir Ector is dumbstruck.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Did you free the sword, boy?

                                     SIR KAY
                         I... did, Father.

               Ector looks at his son amazed, wanting to believe but not 
               able to.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         We must go to the stone at once.

               With Excalibur in hand Ector of Morven heads for the stone, 
               Kay following, and Arthur too, the boy flushed with excitement 
               but a little worried, not understanding what is happening.

               The exchange between Sir Ector and Sir Kay has been overheard. 
               Some have seen the sword in Sir Ector's hand. Rumor spreads 
               like wildfire.

               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               As Sir Ector ascends the stone, from all parts of the jousting 
               ground knights and squires, the Bishop and the clerics, and 
               peasants too, press around.

               Ector lowers the blade into the tight cleft and Excalibur 
               sinks to its original position.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Draw it, son!

               Sir Kay grabs the hilt and pulls without conviction, and the 
               sword doesn't give. Eyes downcast, he lets go.

                                     SIR KAY
                         Sir, I didn't draw the sword. Arthur 
                         gave it to me.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Arthur ?!
                              (spinning around to 
                              face him)
                         How did you get the sword, child?

                                     ARTHUR
                              (frightened)
                         Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was 
                         stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I 
                         took it.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         You freed it, son?

                                     ARTHUR
                         I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.

               He starts to kneel but Ector pulls him up.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Try the sword, Arthur.

               Arthur is about to grasp the hilt when Uryens and Lot, and 
               other nobles, Leondegrance of Camelyarde, and Sir Caradoc 
               and Sir Turquine among the younger, stride up.

                                     URYENS
                         Stand back, Sir Ector, and take your 
                         children.

                                     LOT
                         We will try again.

               Uryens, Lot, Leondegrance, Caradoc, Turquine - each in turn 
               grapples with the sword, only to be defeated by its 
               immobility. The crowd around the stone is thickening with 
               common folk.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Let the boy try the sword.

                                     BISHOP
                         Let the boy try...

               The demand is echoed by peasants and serfs. The great knights 
               remain silent and bitter in their defeat. Sir Ector pushes 
               Arthur to the sword.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Go ahead, boy. Don't be afraid.

               The boy hesitates shyly, and then takes the hilt of Excalibur 
               and pulls out the sword with a great sweep.

               The throng is stunned. Silence falls. Some kneel, following 
               the example of Sir Ector and Sir Kay, of the Bishop and 
               Leondegrance. The other nobles stay back, confused, afraid, 
               angered.

               Arthur stands there, little more than a boy, his cheeks 
               flushed, his soft hair ruffled by the wind, his eyes shining 
               with exultation, awe, and fear. Then, as if gaining confidence 
               from the sword itself, he turns it in arcs above his head.

                                     BISHOP
                         We have our King, thanks be to God.

               The commoners and some of the knights react with roaring 
               enthusiasm. The others draw closer to Uryens and Lot and 
               their supporters, closing ranks around them.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Please, Father, rise up. I was your 
                         son before I became your King... if 
                         I am King.

               Sir Ector rises, tears streaming down his cheeks.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         My Lord, you are King, all the more 
                         because you are not my son, and I am 
                         not your father.

               This is quite a shock to the boy king, and to the onlookers.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who is, then?

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         I don't know. Merlin brought you to 
                         me when you were newly born and 
                         charged me to raise you as my own. 
                         At first, I did so because I feared 
                         Merlin, later because I loved you.

               Merlin's name is on the lips of all those close by.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who is Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         Speak of the devil!...

               From out of the forest strides Merlin, dramatic, cape flowing, 
               eyes crazed as ever, laughing at his own entrance. A crow is 
               perched on his shoulder, and it squawks loudly. Annoyed with 
               it, Merlin swooshes it away.

                                     MERLIN
                         I am Merlin. Counselor to kings. 
                         Wizard and beggar. Prophet and...
                              (he drops it)
                         I have feasted on thunderbolts, I 
                         savored my death before I got myself 
                         born. I--

               Merlin interrupts himself when his eyes fall on the boy, who 
               is taking in his performance raptly, half awestruck, half 
               amused.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Whose son am I?

                                     MERLIN
                         You are the son of King Uther, and 
                         the fair Igrayne... you are King 
                         Arthur.

               The suspicion and confusion and envy of the lords erupts.

                                     LOT
                         Merlin, we haven't forgotten you. 
                         This is more of your trickery.

                                     URYENS
                         You're trying to foist a boy of 
                         dubious birth upon us. You want to 
                         shame us?

                                     LOT
                         Lord Leondegrance, join us against 
                         the boy. Surely you can see he is 
                         only Merlin's tool.

                                     LEONDEGRANCE
                         No. I, Leondegrance, Lord of 
                         Camelyarde, saw the drawing of Uther's 
                         sword, and witnessed no trickery. If 
                         a boy has been chosen, a boy shall 
                         be king.

               The crowd of serfs and peasants cheer wildly, and their long 
               suppressed anger against the nobles comes to the fore. They 
               dare to press up against them, fists hammering on their 
               shields as the chant Arthur King over and over. Dark and 
               scowling, full of rebellion, all the lords except Leondegrance 
               begin to withdraw their iron men surrounding them.

               EXT. CHAPEL, JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               Bells toll the good news. People stream by to see the new 
               king and join the celebration.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Uryens and Lot, and Caradoc, Turquine, and the other lords 
               have mounted, and are moving out, when from the rear guard a 
               bowman in Lot's service draws upon the unarmored figure of 
               Arthur across the cheering crowd. The bowman lets the arrow 
               fly.

               It flies over the heads of the crowd, unseen.

               Except by Merlin at Arthur's side. He extends his arms halfway 
               up, his fists clenched tightly as if drawing urgently on the 
               power within himself. The sound of wings is heard as he flaps 
               his arms.

               The arrow flies toward Arthur.

               Arthur sees the arrow coming right at him, when a swooping 
               crow plucks it out of the air.

               Arthur watches the crow flapping its wings, climbing swiftly, 
               the arrow in its beak, disappearing over the forest. Only he 
               has noticed.

               When he turns Merlin is no longer at his side; to the 
               puzzlement of all. And Arthur is all of a sudden terribly 
               alone and afraid, as people from all sides clamor for his 
               attention and guidance.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Arthur charges through the shadowy forest. He is in armor, 
               but it is only a light tunic of mail. Excalibur is sheathed 
               in a leather scabbard by his side. He is frantic and he calls 
               urgently.

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...Merlin... Merlin...

               His face shines with sweat, the horse is lathered. He 
               dismounts and continues on foot into denser, more tangled 
               undergrowth.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin!

               A huge eye opens in the foreground of what had appeared to 
               be shadow, bark and tufts of weeds is really Merlin's head.

                                     MERLIN
                         You called, sir?

               His voice is thin as he is awakening from a deep, exhausted 
               sleep. Arthur finds him lying within the large gnarled roots 
               of a great tree. The boy kneels before Merlin and lifts his 
               hands and kisses them.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You saved me from the arrow...

                                     MERLIN
                              (a flicker of mischief)
                         But not from your destiny.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I want to thank you.

                                     MERLIN
                         That's not why you came.

               Arthur blurts it out:

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin, help me. I need your help. I 
                         don't know how--

                                     MERLIN
                              (irritated)
                         'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.

               Arthur helps Merlin up and the wizard stands unsteadily.

                                     MERLIN
                         I'm tired. Doing magic takes its 
                         toll, you know. My arms ache 
                         terribly...
                              (he makes flying 
                              movements with his 
                              arms and grimaces)
                         Once--or is it yet to happen--I stood 
                         exposed to the Dragon's breath so 
                         that a man could lie one night with 
                         a woman. It took me ten moons to 
                         recover. I'm sure that story would 
                         interest you, since... Well, we'll 
                         have to talk about it another time. 
                         You're too busy now.

               The forest groans and creaks, alive with murmurs and shrill 
               calls.

                                     MERLIN
                         It is whispered in the forest that...
                              (he cups his ear with 
                              exaggeration)
                         ...Leondegrance's castle is under 
                         siege by Lot and Uryens.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (pressing)
                         Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody 
                         does. Lord Leondegrance is my only 
                         ally among the barons and the great 
                         knights. I can't lose him.

                                     MERLIN
                         Well there. You don't need me half 
                         as much as you think you do. You 
                         already know what must not happen.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (exasperated)
                         I must find the means to save him, 
                         then. I was hoping I could ask you 
                         for a little magic help, but if it 
                         makes you so tired...

                                     MERLIN
                         Thank you.

               Silence. Arthur tries again.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It's just that I have no experience, 
                         and no men to speak of. How can I--

                                     MERLIN
                              (suddenly fierce)
                         Because you must! You and only you. 
                         Have you forgotten that it was you 
                         who freed Excalibur?

               Just as suddenly, he is his amused, ironic self again.

                                     MERLIN
                         Besides, it will be a good lesson.
                              (giggling)
                         The best, if it's not the last.

               Arthur bows his head, confused and almost defeated. Merlin 
               steals a look at him, and puts his arm around the boy.

                                     MERLIN
                         Maybe you'd like to meet the power 
                         that gave you the sword?

               He enjoys being cryptic.

                                     ARTHUR
                         How? Where?

                                     MERLIN
                         In the great book.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What book is that?

                                     MERLIN
                              (melodramatic)
                         The book without pages. Open before 
                         you, all around us. You can see it 
                         in bits and pieces, for if mortal 
                         men were to see it whole and all 
                         complete in a single glance, why, it 
                         would burn him to cinders.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What?!

               EXT. FOREST AND ELSEWHERE - DAY AND NIGHT

                                     MERLIN
                         The dragon! There...

               A deep cleft at the edge of the forest, where far below lava 
               boils with a phosphorescence that lights up a great cloud, 
               billowing upward.

                                     MERLIN
                         Coiled in the unfathomed depths, it 
                         emerges...

               Merlin points to the sky where roiling clouds appear to be 
               unfurling of immeasurable wings.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...It unfolds itself in the storm 
                         clouds...

               A terrific wave batters a coastline, spray shooting up, and 
               as the wave recedes it exposes dark rocks and deep crevices.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...it washes its mane sparkling white 
                         in the blackness of seething 
                         whirlpools...

               Merlin spins Arthur around, and they are transported into a 
               storm swept forest. Lightning strikes.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...its claws are the forks of 
                         lightning... its scales glisten in 
                         the bark of trees...

               The trees shine with wetness, as a great wind tosses their 
               crowns, the branches groaning against each other.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...its voice is heard in the 
                         hurricane...

               Arthur is awestruck.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Arthur and Merlin are back in the same spot, having in fact 
               never moved at all, but traveled on the spell of Merlin's 
               words alone.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...it is so much more than a scaly 
                         monster. It is Everything!

               Arthur's eyes shine with the brilliance of the vision.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And if I am to be King of everything, 
                         lord and commoner, beast, leaf and 
                         rock, I must use its voice, its claws, 
                         its power.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CASTLE OF CAMELYARDE - NIGHT

               Leondegrance, Lord of Camelyarde, is shocked by what he sees 
               in the distance. His daughter Guenevere, a beautiful girl of 
               sixteen, draws close to him, terrified. With his surviving 
               knights, Leondegrance is making his last stand. The walls 
               have been breached, parts of the castle are burning.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               A bellowing dragon advances. Its eyes burn, its scales gleam 
               from light shining from within. It snorts fire from its 
               nostrils.

               Uryens and Lot, Caradoc and Turquine, the great knights in 
               command of the siege of Leondegrance's castle, back away 
               speechless as the monster descends upon their unprepared war 
               camp. All around them, squires and lesser knights flee in 
               panic and confusion.

               Only a dozen or so remain with their leaders. The group backs 
               up against the swampy moat that surrounds the castle, waiting 
               with swords drawn.

               The dragon moves closer, and now it becomes apparent that it 
               is nothing more than a force of knights and footmen. Their 
               shields glinting in the moonlight are the dragon's scales, 
               torches its burning eyes. And the snorting flames from its 
               nostrils are only Merlin doing a fire-eater's trick.

               The dragon form dissolves, and a banner rises bearing the 
               emblem of the Dragon, and under it, Arthur and Ector and Kay 
               lead a charge of twenty knights.

               In Arthur's hands, Excalibur leaves an electric glow upon 
               the air.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Father, it's the boy King.

                                     LEONDEGRANCE
                         It is. I will fight my way to his 
                         side.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Arthur and his men charge into the enemy ranks. Lot's and 
               Uryens' people are pushed into the moat. Although the water 
               is only waist-deep, the fallen, weighed down by their armor, 
               drown. The horses of the attackers are brought down, Arthur's 
               among them. He pulls out from under it, limping. Bleeding 
               form wounds, cutting, slashing, thrusting, he falls back 
               from the havoc of the charge.

               A small distance exists now between the foes, a brief respite. 
               Uryens and Lot, exhausted, bleeding, and fierce in their 
               rage:

                                     URYENS
                         War-wise fighters, grown gray in 
                         battle, checkmated by a boy.

                                     LOT
                         It's Merlin's trickery, nothing more. 
                         I won't swear faith to that wizard's 
                         brat.

               Arthur and his men have been joined by Leondegrance and his 
               knights, few in number.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Let's finish this with a show of 
                         force. We have no more tricks and no 
                         more advantages.

               He rushes alone at the enemy, shouting at the top of his 
               lungs, Excalibur flashing over his head, prepared to die.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Guenevere watches...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         No...

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         No... Arthur--

               The old knight rushes after the boy, sword drawn, to defend 
               his flank, and the others follow, a battle cry issuing from 
               them that is terrifying in its fierceness.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS AND BATTLEFIELD BELOW - NIGHT

               ...and when she can't watch any longer, she buries her face 
               in her hands.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Arthur fights like a wounded lion at the center of the savage 
               melee of sword and shield, and once again the two sides fall 
               apart.

               Uryens and Lot are standing in the moat among the bodies of 
               their men, are reduced to eleven knights, all wounded.

               Arthur is flanked by twenty men at arms, most of them wounded, 
               and trembling now beyond exhaustion with blood lust. Arthur 
               steps forward alone, and addresses his opponents.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are in my hands, to slay or spare. 
                         I need battle lords such as you. 
                         Swear faith to me and you shall have 
                         mercy.

                                     URYENS
                         Noble knights swear faith to a mere 
                         squire?

               Arthur turns, searching for Merlin. He spots him watching 
               from a distance. They stare at each other, Merlin implacable, 
               Arthur's eyes pleading. It's obvious that Merlin isn't going 
               to help.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are right. I'm not yet a knight.
                              (gaining strength)
                         You, Uryens, will knight me.

               He unsheathes Excalibur and goes forward, kneeling before 
               Uryens and offering him the sword.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Then as knight to knight I can offer 
                         you mercy.

                                     MERLIN
                              (to himself)
                         What's this, what's this?!

               Arthur, kneeling, bows his head and Uryens steps up to him, 
               his features set. He accepts the sword. Lot watches, a mad 
               hope dancing in his eyes.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Guenevere watches, frightened for Arthur, not daring to 
               breathe.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Uryens stands towering above the boy. He smiles enigmatically. 
               He lifts Excalibur.

               Merlin is attempting to push through the crowded ranks to 
               get to Arthur.

               He's frantic and worried for once.

                                     MERLIN
                         I never saw this...

               Uryens swiftly lowers the sword on Arthur's neck; with the 
               flat of the blade he gives Arthur the three strokes.

                                     URYENS
                         In the name of God, of Saint Michael 
                         and Saint George, I give you the 
                         right to bear arms, the power to 
                         mete justice.

               Arthur looks up.

                                     ARTHUR
                         That duty I will solemnly obey as 
                         knight and King.

               Uryens is deeply moved.

                                     URYENS
                         Rise, my King. I am your humble 
                         knight, and I swear allegiance to 
                         the courage in your veins, for so 
                         strong it is, it's source must be 
                         Uther. I doubt you no more.

               Arthur rises and Uryens kneels and kisses his hands. Sir 
               Ector turns away to hide brimming tears. Merlin pushes through 
               finally, out of breath. Uryens embraces Leondegrance while 
               Lot and the other enemy knights kneel in turn and kiss 
               Arthur's hands.

               EXT. WOOD BY CAMELYARDE CASTLE - DAY

               The castle can be glimpsed through the trees. A clear spring 
               bubbles from the ground, and the sun splashes leaf, bird, 
               squirrel, and bee with golden light, and Arthur and Guenevere 
               too. Guenevere is serious and intent on her work.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Owww...

               With water from the spring, she is bathing a large cut on 
               his chest that has been stitched closed. Wounds on his arms, 
               and one on a calf also show evidence of her neat sewing. 
               She's just finishing, and she dabs his chest with a dry cloth.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         It didn't hurt too much, did it?

                                     ARTHUR
                         Ye...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         --I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've 
                         sewn my father's wounds more than 
                         once.

               He starts to get up.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Careful! You'll have to stay still 
                         for a few days or you'll tear them 
                         open.

               Arthur shivers at the thought.

                                     ARTHUR
                         But I have to leave tomorrow. The 
                         forests are thick with rebels, 
                         invaders plunder our shores...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         --And damsels in besieged castles 
                         are waiting to be rescued?

                                     ARTHUR
                         I didn't know Leondegrance had a 
                         daughter.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Well, then, I shall tell you which 
                         knights have maiden daughters, so 
                         you can avoid their castles.

               Arthur smiles at her, enjoying her jealousy, and it irritates 
               her a little.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         No, I think it's better if you just 
                         stay here to heal. At least a week.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I'm going.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth 
                         too.

               She touches his lips with hers, her eyelids fluttering shut. 
               He stares at her young beauty, and draws her into a long, 
               slow kiss.

               A shrill almost human squeal pierces the air not far away. 
               Arthur pulls away startled, half-rising. Guenevere giggles.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Would you rescue me from a fiery 
                         dragon, sir?

               She puts her arms around him, drawing him close again, 
               speaking in a half-whisper.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         It's just a furry little rabbit that 
                         took the bait and sprung the trap.

               They smile at each other, about to kiss. As they come closer:

                                     GUENEVERE
                         You'll find him served up to you 
                         tonight, cooked in a most excellent 
                         sauce...

               INT. BANQUET HALL, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - EVENING

               The soft beat of psaltery and the liquid flow of lute. A 
               serving platter bearing roast rabbit in rampant position is 
               carried across the hall. It is laid on the long raised table 
               before Arthur, who presides in the middle. He looks at it 
               suspiciously and blushes, remembering the afternoon; and it 
               looks back at him accusingly with its cherry eye.

               Guenevere is dancing around her father, lovely, gliding, 
               sensual. She sees Arthur and the rabbit and laughs out-right. 
               He twists off a leg of the rabbit and sinks his teeth into 
               it to hide his embarrassment. Guenevere passes to another 
               partner, smiling at him, radiant. Arthur watches her, his 
               heart breaking. He is in love.

               Merlin leans close.

                                     MERLIN
                         A king must marry, after all.

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...of course...

               Only then does he realize that Merlin has understood 
               everything. He is annoyed at being so transparent.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I love her. If she would be my queen, 
                         my dreams would be answered.

                                     MERLIN
                              (mischievous)
                         There are maidens as fair, and fairer 
                         than Guenevere. If I put my mind to 
                         it, I could see them now, many of 
                         them, weeping for love of you, 
                         watching the hills for you coming 
                         from the high towers of their castles. 
                         Offering you their every favor. Rich, 
                         clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, 
                         so be it.

               A shadow of doubt crosses Arthur's brow.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who will it be? Put your mind to it, 
                         then.

                                     MERLIN
                         Guenevere. And a beloved friend who 
                         will betray you.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (smiling)
                         Guenevere...

                                     MERLIN
                         You're not listening. Your heart is 
                         not. Love is deaf as well as blind.

               Guenevere approaches, smiling and coquettish. She slaps her 
               hands, and a servant sets down a tray of pastries before 
               Arthur.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         They are only for you, for in them I 
                         mixed things that heal, but not too 
                         quickly; and things that make limbs 
                         sleepy, preventing escape, but keep 
                         one's mind sharp.

               She smiles at Arthur's embarrassment and confusion.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What's in them?

               She takes a cake and bites into it.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         It is an ancient mixture, containing 
                         only soft, unborn grains, and flavored 
                         with roses. The rest is secret.

               Guenevere offers one to Arthur, and he hesitates, looking at 
               it.

                                     MERLIN
                         Looking at the cake is like looking 
                         at the future. Until you have savored 
                         its bitterness and its sweetness, 
                         its texture and its perfume, what do 
                         you really know? And then, of course, 
                         it will he too late.

               Arthur bites into the cake, and Guenevere looks deep into 
               his eyes.

                                     MERLIN
                         Too late...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "...but for years war kept Arthur from thoughts of marriage."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. OAK FOREST - DAY

               War tents have been pitched beneath the majestic trees. Near 
               the banner of the Dragon a doe grazes. Arthur is older, in 
               battle-scarred plate armor, pacing and angry. He is watched 
               by his wounded and bruised knights--Kay, Uryens, Lot, 
               Leondegrance, Caradoc, and some new young faces among the 
               ranks. No one talks.

               The harsh clank of its battle trappings announces the arrival 
               of a horse. All eyes watch it walk into the camp. A knight 
               is slouched in the saddle.

               Arthur runs to meet the horse, followed by squires and some 
               of the knights.

               He eases the rider to the ground, unlaces his helmet. It is 
               Sir Ector, and his hauberk is badly dented. Tears burn in 
               Arthur's eyes.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         He is the mightiest and fairest of 
                         knights.

                                     ARTHUR
                         We fought and won battles, and now 
                         one man defeats all my knights? I 
                         will go.

               He pushes past the knights and goes to his horse. Kay steps 
               in front of him.

                                     SIR KAY
                         A king must not engage in single 
                         contest. I'll go again.

               Arthur rises into the saddle and takes a jousting spear from 
               the rack.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Where is Merlin?

               The squires are silent.

               Arthur gallops off in the direction Sir Ector came from. His 
               knights are afraid for him.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               His countenance grim, Arthur gallops along a trail bordering 
               a plowed field when in it a scarecrow moves. It starts to 
               run as stick-wielding farmers pursue it. It is Merlin. Arthur 
               turns off into the field, and at the sight of an armored 
               knight on a war horse, the farmers turn and flee. Merlin 
               stops to catch his breath.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (angry)
                         I should have left you to fend for 
                         yourself.

                                     MERLIN
                         I had to weave a little enchantment 
                         on the bees so I could get some honey, 
                         and I didn't feel up to using any 
                         more magic just yet. Anyway, I was 
                         in less danger than you'll be in 
                         today.

               Arthur's hand is clenched tight around Excalibur's hilt.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So you were stealing their honey. 
                         They should have killed you.

                                     MERLIN
                         Come now. So much anger for such a 
                         little crime? Are you sure there is 
                         nothing else troubling you?

                                     ARTHUR
                         You know full well there is, and I 
                         go to meet it now. Come witness my 
                         revenge.

               He offers his arm and Merlin hoists himself up behind the 
               King.

               EXT. GORGE THROUGH THE HILLS - DAY

               A waterfall cascades into a pool. The spray casts a rainbow. 
               Beneath it is a colorful confusion of flowers and budding 
               trees, a place dreamlike in its beauty.

               Arthur, with Merlin behind, gallops along the edge of the 
               pool. The trail widens into a field of grass. Arthur reins 
               beside a pile of broken lances and twisted shields. Across 
               the field, pitched upon the trail is a war tent made of 
               diaphanous white silk, a sky blue banner above it. Merlin 
               slides off and Arthur continues.

               From the tent, a knight with jousting lance rides forward to 
               meet him. His armor is so shiny it is a mirror. His eyes, 
               seen through the open visor, seem to laugh. His speech is 
               foreign, from across the sea. He is Lancelot of the Lake.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Good day to you, sir.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Move aside. This is the King's road, 
                         and the knights you joined arms 
                         against were his very own.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I await the King himself. His knights 
                         are in need of training.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am King, and this is Excalibur, 
                         sword of kings from the dawn of time. 
                         Who are you, and why do you block 
                         the way?

                                     LANCELOT
                         I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from 
                         across the sea. I am the best knight 
                         in the whole of Christiandom, and I 
                         look for the king who is worthy of 
                         my sword's service.

                                     ARTHUR
                         --That is a wild boast. You lack a 
                         knight's humility.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Not a boast, sir, but a curse.
                              (a cloud passes over 
                              his innocent face)
                         Never have I met my match in joust 
                         or duel.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Move aside!

                                     LANCELOT
                         I will not. You must retreat or prove 
                         your kingship in the test of arms, 
                         under the eyes of God.

               He crosses himself.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Then may He give me the strength to 
                         unhorse you and send you with one 
                         blow back across the sea.

               Arthur wheels away, trembling with anger, and gallops to his 
               edge of the field. He sees that Lancelot has already 
               positioned himself and is waiting, lance down.

               Merlin watches, a spectator, as the two charge at each other. 
               They collide with great force, their spears shattering. Arthur 
               is jolted but stays in the saddle. Lancelot's jousting is 
               impeccable. Arthur draws Excalibur.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Hold! I offer you another lance.

               Pages come forward with new lances for Arthur and Lancelot.

                                     LANCELOT
                         You joust well, sir. Battle learnt, 
                         but tournament fancy. You should 
                         ride more forward in the saddle, 
                         though.

               Arthur grabs the spear from the page's hands, and circles 
               back to work the horse up into an all-out gallop. Lancelot 
               spurs forward to meet him. Arthur is neatly unhorsed. He 
               picks himself up from the ground in a rage, drawing Excalibur. 
               Lancelot on his horse weaves circles around him.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Yield. I have the advantage.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I will not.

               Arthur charges Lancelot, a raging bull, but cuts and slashes 
               only at the air as Lancelot stays clear of him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Fight me from your horse or on foot, 
                         but fight me. Your avoidance mocks 
                         me.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I sought only not to harm you, sir.

               He dismounts and draws his sword, and they clash. Shield and 
               sword and armor against shield and sword and armor. The 
               swordplay is furious, Arthur attacking, slashing, hacking, 
               Lancelot parrying effortlessly, elegantly defensive. Arthur 
               breaks the onslaught to catch his breath. Lancelot lifts his 
               visor. His eyes are calm, laughing.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. 
                         It seems you would fight to the death 
                         against a knight who is not your 
                         enemy, for a length of road you can 
                         ride around.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So be it, to the death.

                                     LANCELOT
                         It is you, sir, who knows not the 
                         virtue of humility, as a true king 
                         must.

               Arthur goes forward attacking with terrible blows upon 
               Lancelot's shield, and Lancelot holds his ground, shield 
               high. And in its mirror-like metal Arthur can see his own 
               reflection, a face distorted by uncontrolled passion.

               Arthur discards his own shield, grabs Excalibur with both 
               hands, and with a frightening shout that speaks of all his 
               rage, he swings a terrific blow upon the shield, cutting 
               through his own reflection and the metal. And Excalibur snaps 
               in two.

               A blinding blue-green light explodes from the broken sword. 
               Lancelot, knocked back by the force of the blow, is stunned 
               by the blast and falls to the ground unconscious. Arthur 
               backs away, horrified, half of Excalibur in his hand.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What horror is this?
                              (calling)
                         Merlin!

               Merlin approaches, pale, gripped by dread.

                                     MERLIN
                         The sword is broken. Hope is broken...

               Arthur picks up the broken blade, utterly undone.

                                     ARTHUR
                         My pride broke it, my rage broke 
                         it... Humiliation and defeat lie in 
                         ambush even for a king.
                              (looking at Lancelot)
                         This excellent knight who fought 
                         with fairness and grace was meant to 
                         win. With Excalibur, I tried to change 
                         that verdict.

               Merlin stands there, drawn, defeated, his hopes dead.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I have lost for all time the ancient 
                         sword of my fathers whose power was 
                         meant to unite all men, to serve the 
                         vanity of a single man.

               Despairing, he flings the two parts of Excalibur into the 
               pool. He kneels at the waters edge, and he cries.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am nothing.

               Then Arthur sees something that startles him. Beneath the 
               surface, suspended in the blue-green water amid the dancing 
               weeds, he sees Excalibur, intact.

               It is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, 
               her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Excalibur! Is it true?

                                     MERLIN
                         The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take 
                         it, quickly!

               Arthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and 
               the moment he does the vision in the blue-green water fades. 
               He rises with Excalibur in hand, and Merlin speaks before 
               Arthur can ask the question.

                                     MERLIN
                         There are infinite worlds within the 
                         infinite coils of the Dragon. In one 
                         of them, which I have not traveled, 
                         the sword was forged. I only know 
                         that the King is returned to us 
                         through the instrument of his power. 
                         The game continues!

               And he laughs.

               Just then Lancelot stirs. Arthur rushes to his side. He 
               loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls. 
               The young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once 
               more animates his face.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Thanks to God, you are alive.

                                     LANCELOT
                              (sitting up)
                         I, the best knight in the world, 
                         bested! This is a great day, for my 
                         search is over. I love you, my King.

               He embraces Arthur, who is overwhelmed by his childlike 
               directness. The King helps him to his feet.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are still the best knight in 
                         Christiandom. You gained a hundred 
                         advantages over me. It is I who must 
                         love you, for through your courage 
                         and patience you taught me a bitter 
                         lesson.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Then make me your champion and I 
                         will always fight in your place.

                                     ARTHUR
                         But your life and lands are far from 
                         here.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I gave up my castles and my lands!

               He thumps his breastplate.

                                     LANCELOT
                         My domain is here, inside this metal 
                         skin. And I would pledge to you all 
                         that I still own: muscle, bone, blood 
                         and the heart that pumps it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, 
                         you will be my champion.

               Lancelot draws his sword, holding it by the blade, a crucifix.

                                     LANCELOT
                         In the name of Jesus Christ and His 
                         holy blood, I swear eternal faith to 
                         Arthur, King.

               They embrace, and Merlin watches.

               EXT. ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Converging from different directions parties of mounted 
               knights enter the war camp. Lancelot among them. They 
               dismount, battle-weary and burning with the excitement of 
               victory. They quench their huge thirst from buckets carried 
               by squires. They rip off hunks of meat from carcasses sizzling 
               on spits over a roaring fire. And they join the throng of 
               knights, where stories of deeds of arms of the day are 
               enthusiastically exchanged.

               A great number of knights are packed tightly around King 
               Arthur, each man anxious to tell of his victories. One of 
               them has the King's attention.

                                     KNIGHT
                         ...We killed every one of them. Burnt 
                         their ship...

               Arthur sees Lancelot in the throng and moves toward him. 
               Merlin follows Arthur and is pushed and knocked around in 
               the crush of spikes and iron. The only unarmored man in the 
               crowd, he glares at the excited knights irritably.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lancelot, how did you fare in the 
                         North?

                                     LANCELOT
                         We spared the lives of a few, so 
                         they could sail home and tell their 
                         fellows what fate they met at the 
                         hands of King Arthur's knights...

               Arthur turns toward Uryens.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And you, Uryens?

                                     URYENS
                         Victory!

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lot, and you?

                                     LOT
                         We drove the invaders into the sea.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You, Gawain, the East?

                                     GAWAIN
                         The East is ours again.

               Cheers greet each declaration.

                                     ARTHUR
                         The war is over. One land, one King. 
                         Peace.

               Amidst the celebration, a fracas is heard. A knight pushing 
               forward to talk to Arthur has entered a shoving match with 
               those in front of him.

                                     KNIGHT
                         Let me through. I fought the King's 
                         battle too. He must know my story.

               Merlin is brutally jostled. He draws a fistful of powder 
               from his cape and he tosses it into the air above him. He 
               raises his staff into the cloud, cracking it like a whip. 
               The tip of the staff catches fire, and the fire spreads 
               through the powder in the air, stunning all into silence. 
               Merlin shouts and snarls.

                                     MERLIN
                         Chaos... confusion... brutes... 
                         savages... troglodytes... Stand 
                         back... make space.

               Merlin swings his burning staff into a wide arc. The knights 
               back away, amused at first, then a bit afraid.

                                     MERLIN
                         The moon... the sun... the stars... 
                         they spin... they turn... they 
                         circle... around us... us...

               The knights have fallen back. Merlin stalks past each man, 
               and Arthur too, holding the flaming tip of his staff before 
               each pair of eyes, and staring into them with his gimlet 
               gaze.

                                     MERLIN
                         You, and you, and you, take up your 
                         place. Be wedded to the world. Respect 
                         its perfection. All of you, together, 
                         be one.

               The knights have formed a circle. They realize this. 
               Awestruck, they whisper in astonishment, looking up at the 
               sky burning with stars. Merlin brims with pride as he waits 
               for Arthur to recognize his handiwork.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Your ancient wisdom and infinite 
                         sight have forged this circle, Merlin. 
                         Hereafter we shall come together in 
                         a circle, to tell and hear of deeds 
                         good and brave. I will build a table 
                         where this fellowship shall meet. 
                         And a hall around the table. And a 
                         castle about the hall.

               A cheer rises. Arthur strides into the ring of knights.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And I will marry.

               Another bout of cheers goes up, and Arthur stops before 
               Leondegrance, resting his hand on the old knight's shoulder.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And the land will have an heir to 
                         wield Excalibur.

               Leondegrance's eyes fill with tears of joy. A roar of cheers. 
               Arthur draws the sword of power.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Knights of the Round Table, good 
                         friends, brothers in arms. I send 
                         you on a quest harder by far than 
                         the battles we have fought together, 
                         a quest to uphold always, and 
                         everywhere, justice, honor, and truth. 
                         Each day shall bring forth a cause, 
                         and may each cause bring forth a 
                         knight.

               Lancelot is drawn in by the King's enthusiasm. He unsheathes 
               his sword and swoops it low in salute.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I swear never to rest twice on the 
                         same pillow till all men live at 
                         peace.

               In quick succession all knights draw their swords, following 
               Lancelot's example.

               Merlin struggles to put out the flame on his staff. He finally 
               does it by smothering it with earth. When he looks up again, 
               he sees the knights galloping off in all directions.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

               Terrified women, a screaming child, cowering men, old or 
               made old by the hard labor of the fields. Armored men are 
               ransacking a farm, looking for grain, and gold which they 
               find among the votive objects of a little house altar. A 
               woman is dragged away to be raped.

               Through a window, a knight in shining armor is seen emerging 
               from the adjoining woods. The plunderers are all of a sudden 
               apprehensive, and fall silent. One of them grabs the crying 
               child and covers her mouth with his iron hand.

               EXT. FARMYARD - DAY

               The knight is Lancelot, in his mirror-like armor. He rides 
               into the cluster of houses and barns that make up the farm. 
               There are other armored men there, around a cart half-loaded 
               with loot. They smile nervously at Lancelot. The farmers are 
               blank with fear.

               Lancelot stops in the middle of the yard. A knight among the 
               armored men comes forward.

                                     KNIGHT
                         Good day, sir.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Good day to you.

               And he also acknowledges with a nod the ashen-faced patriarch 
               of the community.

               Lancelot spurs his horse on, and the knight sighs with relief. 
               But then he reins his horse to a stop. He has sensed 
               something. He turns his head, his hooded eyes on the knight 
               and his men, and they squirm inwardly.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

               The child, her mouth covered by the armored hand.

               EXT. FARMYARD - DAY

               Lancelot, listening, watching.

               INT. BARN - DAY

               The woman, a blade flashing next to her eye.

               EXT. FARMYARD - DAY

               Lancelot, immobile. Behind him, the knight, his face shiny 
               with sweat. His minions inch forward, hands moving slowly 
               toward sword hilts.

               Lancelot wheels his horse around.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I hear the stifled cry for help, I 
                         smell the reek of fear...

               With a shout the knight and his men draw their swords and 
               rush Lancelot. He reins in his horse, causing it to rear and 
               break their attack. He slides off, falling on his feet with 
               sword drawn, already fighting. In an extraordinary show of 
               sword play he cuts down six men.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

               Hearing Lancelot storm in, the man holding the child hands 
               her to a woman and kneels before the altar, just as Lancelot 
               bursts into the room, sword high and already swooping down 
               on the man's neck. Lancelot brings the sword to a halt mid-
               air, his fury held in check. The repent man is spared. The 
               woman kneels to kiss Lancelot's hand.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               The field is pitched with war tents and pavilions decked for 
               holiday. Nobles and knights flank the King and Guenevere, a 
               beautiful vision in white samite, a wreath of flowers around 
               her head. Lancelot leads a long file of prisoners to the 
               King. They fall to their knees, begging forgiveness; among 
               them is the man whom Lancelot had spared before the altar.

                                     LANCELOT
                         These men repented before God for 
                         their evil deeds. Those who would 
                         not, met their fate at the end of my 
                         sword.
                              (he kneels)
                         Accept the fruit of my first quest 
                         as my wedding gift.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.

               He rises and follows Arthur and Guenevere into the central 
               pavilion. Pages draw its curtains closed as they pass inside.

               INT. PAVILION - DAY

               Guenevere is surrounded by a group of ladies and maids who 
               fuss over her dress and her hair. They eye the great knight 
               and whisper about him, Guenevere laughing with them.

               Arthur sits, excited and happy.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Sit beside me, Lancelot.

               Lancelot sits, stiff and upright.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Your deeds set an example for all 
                         other knights. For your gift, ask a 
                         gift of me.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Only give me leave to ride out again, 
                         to do what I am most able to do, and 
                         happiest doing.

               Guenevere overhears. She approaches and Lancelot jumps to 
               his feet.

                                     GUENEVERE
                              (to Arthur)
                         He must stay for the feasting days 
                         of our wedding, and tell his deeds 
                         himself.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (to Lancelot, smiling)
                         I grant you your wish if you grant 
                         Lady Guenevere hers.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I will stay Madame.

               Merlin leans close to Arthur.

                                     MERLIN
                         The knights of Galys approach the 
                         camp. It would be politic...

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...to ride out and meet them.

               He rises. Lancelot, who was about to sit again, straightens.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, 
                         rest here.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Don't start a war on my wedding day!

                                     ARTHUR
                         Without Lancelot?!

               Arthur and Merlin exit, leaving Guenevere and Lancelot. She 
               looks at him, lively and amused, and he can't help smiling.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Look Lancelot. The maids and ladies 
                         whisper about you. They all dream of 
                         winning you, young and old, fair and 
                         ugly.

               Lancelot blushes.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         But surely that's no secret to you, 
                         dear Lancelot. You're the bravest 
                         and strongest knight they've ever 
                         seen, and beauty has kissed your 
                         brow.

               He can't look at her.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         The well-kept secret is whether any 
                         of them has won your heart.

                                     LANCELOT
                         No.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Why?

                                     LANCELOT
                         I am a fighting man and I am married 
                         to the quest. That is enough.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         And there is no maiden in the whole 
                         world who inspires you?

                                     LANCELOT
                         There is one.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Who?!

                                     LANCELOT
                         You.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Me?

                                     LANCELOT
                         Yes. I would swear my love to you.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         To me? But why?

                                     LANCELOT
                         I cannot love as a woman the lady 
                         who will be wife to my King and my 
                         friend. And, in pledging my love to 
                         you, I cannot love any other woman.

               Guenevere smiles, moved by his blunt innocence.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I will see you in all women, and I 
                         will defend them as I would defend 
                         you.

               He kneels, kisses her thigh, rises and leaves.

               INT. CHAPEL - DAY

               A chorus of children sings. The Bishop waits at the altar 
               with his friars and altar boys. Cornucopias overflowing with 
               vegetables and wildflowers adorn the church, which glows 
               with the light of a thousand candles. Sir Kay is satisfied. 
               He comes back up the petal-strewn aisle.

               EXT. CHAPEL, SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Arthur and Guenevere are ushered in by Kay. They are flanked 
               by Leondegrance and Sir Ector. Lancelot and Merlin follow, 
               leading the cortege of knights and ladies.

               Merlin is incapable of entering the chapel, as if at the 
               threshold there is an unseen force that repels him.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Lord Merlin, are you ill?

                                     MERLIN
                         No, no, I need air.

               Strangling a laugh he wrenches himself away. Just then Uryens 
               and a small party of knights rides up through the tents and 
               dismounts in front of the church. Uryens helps a lady off 
               her horse and joins the cortege on foot.

                                     URYENS
                         Merlin, don't you join the 
                         celebration?

               Merlin, who was slinking away through the throng of 
               bystanders, looks up. What he sees sends a chill through his 
               body.

               At Uryens' side stands a young woman of sinister beauty, 
               with bewitching eyes of ice. Merlin just stares at her, and 
               she smiles back at him faintly.

                                     URYENS
                         My wife, Merlin. Lady Morgana of 
                         Cornwall.

                                     MORGANA
                         I remember you, Merlin. I was a child. 
                         You took my brother away.

               Merlin laughs. Uryens shrugs and continues into the chapel 
               with Morgana. As she enters she glances back, and just then 
               Merlin steals a look, their eyes meet.

               INT. CHAPEL - DAY

               Uryens and Morgana take their places near the altar. Arthur 
               and Guenevere kneel before the Bishop, and Arthur takes her 
               hand. The clatter of armor mingles with the enthusiastic, 
               happy singing of the children, and seems to strengthen their 
               song.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - EVENING

               The chorus carries across the field to the dark wall of trees 
               from which issues another chorus, of hoots and squawks and 
               howls. Merlin advances along the edge of the forest. He stops 
               by the stone that once held the sword, his eyes wild. He 
               forgets his inner torment when he sees a plant at the base 
               of the stone. He kneels beside it and plucks it. He admires 
               its strange flowers; he smells them.

               Two feet appear at his side. He rises to be face to face 
               with Morgana. They look deep into each other. Then Merlin 
               breaks the silence.

                                     MERLIN
                         You left your husband's side? You 
                         left your brother's wedding?

                                     MORGANA
                         Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         It is.

                                     MORGANA
                         Can it truly be used for magic?

               Merlin smiles at last, and Morgana does, her eyes piercing, 
               cruel and lovely.

                                     MERLIN
                         Yes... sometimes...

               His gaze drifts toward the chapel.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...There are many powers in this 
                         world.

               INT. CHAPEL - EVENING

               Arthur and Guenevere are radiant with joy, and Lancelot behind 
               them mirrors the ceremony of their joining in his armor; and 
               the sweet voices of the children fill the chapel as the Bishop 
               pours the wine into the chalice, and lifts it up before him, 
               blessing it.

               He turns to the royal couple.

                                     BISHOP
                         Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ 
                         our Lord.

               The chalice seems to burn with a mystical light; and as the 
               chorus soars:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "And Arthur built his castle, Camelot. And one day, in the 
               far reaches of the Kingdom..."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. FOREST, STREAM - DAY

               It is shadowy and dark; ancient trees creak, unseen animals 
               cry out. A rabbit hops into view and a boy leaps forward, 
               grabbing the animal by the ears before it can move. He--
               Perceval--is a wild boy of seventeen, dressed in skins with 
               an endearing and childlike smile.

                                     PERCEVAL
                              (to the rabbit)
                         Sorry. Hungry.

               A din is heard to the forest, and it grows. Perceval glances 
               around, panicked. The sound is the rubbing of leather upon 
               leather, of metal on metal, for now a mounted figure in armor 
               hovers over the terrified boy.

                                     PERCEVAL
                              (stuttering)
                         Have I taken too much?

               He lets the rabbit go free. The threatening figure dismounts. 
               And Perceval, cartwheels backward, landing in the stream and 
               scooping a fish out.

                                     PERCEVAL
                              (desperately trying 
                              to ingratiate)
                         I had rabbit yesterday. Today I'll 
                         eat fish... No?

               He returns the fish to the water. The figure steps into a 
               pool of sunlight and a glorious halo streaks from the armor. 
               It is Lancelot.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Don't be afraid.

               Perceval is overcome with astonishment, and he kneels.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You're an angel! Not a devil...

               Lancelot laughs and pulls the boy to his feet.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Just a man. A knight in the King's 
                         service.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You're a man?!
                              (he reaches out to 
                              touch Lancelot)
                         ...with metal skin!

               Perceval is beside himself with enthusiasm.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Can I grow metal skin?

               Lancelot rolls his eyes, amused.

                                     LANCELOT
                         You've got a lot to learn.

               EXT. SPARSE FOREST - DAY

               Lancelot is cantering and Perceval is running alongside, 
               shouting in gasps.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I'll learn... take me... to the 
                         King... What's a... King?

               Lancelot shakes his head and spurs the horse into a gallop. 
               Perceval lengthens his stride, and keeps up! Lancelot reins 
               to a halt.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Very well. Climb up.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will run.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Listen, boy, it's more than twenty 
                         days from here.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Twenty days!? The world is that big?

               EXT. OUTSIDE CAMELOT, FOREST - DAY

               Perceval cannot believe his eyes. As Lancelot and Kay talk 
               about him out of earshot, he sees things that he's never 
               seen before; and he gapes like the country bumpkin that he 
               is.

               Dragon-like kites sweep low, maneuvered by children. In a 
               meadow among the trees, knights hone their skills with lance 
               and sword, and ladies watch and their "bright eyes rain 
               influence and judge the prize." And then, there is Camelot 
               itself; the great gate and the drawbridge; the massive walls, 
               and the soaring towers and spires above.

               Perceval rushes up to Lancelot and Kay.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Who will give me my sword?

               Kay is not at all pleased; nonetheless he takes the boy by 
               the ear and leads him across the drawbridge and into the 
               castle.

                                     KAY
                         Kitchen knives and greasy spits will 
                         be your weapons, boy.

               Lancelot smiles to himself, hesitation, lingering before the 
               great gate of Camelot.

               There is a walkway suspended in the trees above, that also 
               leads to the castle, and promenading on it is a group of 
               women, Guenevere and her ladies-in-waiting. The Queen sees 
               Lancelot and hastens toward him.

               Lancelot sees her, and mounts his horse and heads back into 
               the forest. She stops, somewhat ahead of the ladies, and 
               watches wistfully.

               Lancelot turns back and seeing her one last time, draws down 
               his visor and spurs his horse into a canter.

               He passes two commoners who are heading for the castle, one 
               fat and the other thin, and they are locked in hot dispute. 
               Their wives keep them from coming to blows and their children 
               spur them on, enjoying the excitement.

               Lancelot is swallowed by the forest.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - DAY

               Guenevere, bearing a bowl of perfect, deep red apples, 
               approaches the Round Table, where Arthur sits and Merlin at 
               his side, attending to the affairs of the kingdom. Quite a 
               few of the knights occupy their seats, talking with each 
               other, drinking and laughing, attended by ladies and pages. 
               Guenevere places the apples at Lancelot's empty place and 
               takes her seat next to Arthur.

               In the archways that lead into the hall, petitioners wait, 
               eating, drinking, talking among themselves. In the din, no 
               one pays attention to the vehement arguing of the fat man 
               and the thin man, which continues even here. The hall is the 
               burgeoning, happy center of the kingdom.

               But Merlin is oblivious to the lively clamor. He gazes like 
               a lovesick puppy across the table at Morgana, who bends over 
               whispering to a knight at the table, the young Sir Gahalt,, 
               while his older brother Sir Gawain listens. Morgana notices 
               Merlin's stare and smiles at him, and then resumes her 
               flirtation with Sir Gahalt, much to Merlin's annoyance.

               Sir Kay ushers the thin man and the fat man into the open 
               space at the center of the table for their audience with the 
               king. They quarrel even as Kay tries to present them, and 
               the attention of the hall gradually focuses on them.

               The two men talk at once, interrupting, overlapping.

                         FAT MAN
                 I brew ale, sir--from 
                 old shoes--I am an 
                 honest tradesman sir. 
                 I must sell what I 
                 produce. He won't buy 
                 ale and he won't pay. 
                 Pay up! He leans over 
                 the barrel and sucks 
                 in the vapors. The 
                 vapors are mine.

                                                       THIN MAN
                                               How would you know I, sir, 
                                               have the misfortune to 
                                               live next to this 
                                               criminal... What loss in 
                                               that? Not to me! Pay for 
                                               what? Why?! They are 
                                               floating on the wind. 

               Arthur is both amused and exasperated.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Enough!... What is a fair price for 
                         the smell of your ale?

                                     FAT MAN
                         That's why we have come to you, sir 
                         There's no one else who can tell us.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What does it cost to get drunk on 
                         your ale?

                                     FAT MAN
                         At least three shillings, sir.

               Arthur addresses the Thin Man.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Give me three shillings.

               The Thin Man is crestfallen, the smile gone from his face. 
               He reluctantly hands the coins to Kay, who gives them to 
               Arthur. Arthur tosses them in the air and lets them fall on 
               a metal plate. He hands them back to the Thin Man, who is 
               totally confused now, as is everybody else.

                                     ARTHUR
                         For the smell of your ale, the jingle 
                         of his coins.

               The knights roar with laughter and the Fat Man and the Thin 
               Man look at each other in astonishment. Perceval lets out a 
               raucous laugh that wins him a glance of disapproval from 
               Kay.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT

               The din of the petitioners is replaced by music. It is the 
               hour of the evening feast, and all knights are present, except 
               Lancelot. Whole tree trunks burn in the great fireplace, and 
               lambs roast on spits in the flames. Pages run to and fro 
               with trays of food and wine, Perceval among them.

               Morgana stops beside Merlin.

                                     MORGANA
                         What did I see today in the wizard's 
                         eyes? Censure, because I enjoy a few 
                         words with a young handsome knight?

               Merlin is in agony, a bug stuck on a pin.

                                     MERLIN
                         No, no, of course not. You are 
                         young...

                                     MERLIN
                         I'm not jealous!

                                     MORGANA
                         It's clear you are, and it irks me.

                                     MERLIN
                         No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want 
                         to write poems about you with 
                         moonbeams, make the sea sing your 
                         name...

                                     MORGANA
                         A lovestruck page!

                                     MERLIN
                         Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, 
                         please... Morgana.

               She does, laughing and in complete control. His hand 
               immediately slides onto her thigh. She removes it, but holds 
               it in her hand, toying with his fingers.

                                     MORGANA
                         A steamy, panting, lovestruck page. 
                         But what good are songs and poems to 
                         me? They are the barter of ordinary 
                         love. A gift that reflected your 
                         greatness is the only one worthy of 
                         your love.

               Merlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager.

                                     MERLIN
                         I showed you all my conjuring 
                         tricks...

                                     MORGANA
                         The deepest secrets, the forbidden 
                         formulas...

                                     MERLIN
                         Maybe... maybe...

               Merlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes 
               that Arthur is addressing him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin, are you counselor to the 
                         King, or to my sister?

               Some knights laugh.

                                     MERLIN
                         At your service, sir.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Then answer me this. For years peace 
                         has reigned in the land. Crops grow 
                         in abundance, there is no want. Every 
                         one of my subjects enjoys his portion 
                         of happiness and justice, even those 
                         whose tiresome misunderstandings we 
                         must resolve here each day. Tell me, 
                         Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it 
                         seems?

                                     MERLIN
                         Good and evil; there is never one 
                         without the other.

               Arthur is taken aback.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

                                     MERLIN
                         Never where you expect it, that's 
                         all I know.

               He chuckles softly and Arthur is puzzled. A knight speaks 
               out, the young knight with whom Morgana was flirting. His 
               manner is sarcastic.

                                     SIR GAHALT
                         If we have peace and justice, why is 
                         Lancelot never with us? Why is he 
                         always riding out on his quests? He 
                         must know where this evil is.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         Could there be evil within Lancelot 
                         himself? To live above human folly, 
                         as is his aim, is to be overly proud.

                                     SIR GAHALT
                         He pays no heed even to the Queens 
                         longing for his company.

               The hall falls silent, all eyes upon the Queen.

                                     GUENEVERE
                              (lashing out)
                         What is it you would have your words 
                         mean, Sir Gahalt?

               Frightened, Gahalt doesn't answer. Morgana has slipped to 
               Guenevere's side.

                                     MORGANA
                         Don't listen to him. You are the 
                         Queen.

               Arthur, ashen-faced, turns to Merlin for help, but he has 
               escaped into sleep...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         No. I meant not to be angry with 
                         you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness 
                         that comes with peace gossip has 
                         bread its own evil. You merely repeat 
                         it. Please, sir, have one of those 
                         apples that Lancelot loves, and in 
                         that gesture partake of its goodness.

               Morgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any 
               and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails 
               deep into the top apple. She gives the bowl to Guenevere, 
               who takes it and sweeps around to where Sir Gahalt sits, 
               followed by Morgana. The young knight jumps to his feet.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Take one, Sir Gahalt.

                                     SIR GAHALT
                         I am most honored, my lady.

               He is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on 
               top, and goes for another one. Morgana giggles, and he looks 
               at her. She looks at the apple on top and then smiles 
               encouragingly at him. Sir Gahalt takes it and starts eating 
               as the Queen returns to her seat.

               With the third bite his is unable to breathe. His face goes 
               red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out.

               He falls, dying immediately. All leap to their feet, and 
               Arthur rushes to the young knight. Merlin is asleep and far 
               from human affairs.

               Arthur and Sir Gawain rise from the body of the young knight. 
               Sir Gawain backs away from Arthur and points at Guenevere, 
               trembling with cold rage.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights 
                         and chieftains: I charge Guenevere 
                         with the murder of my brother.

               Guenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to Arthur.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I didn't... I am innocent.

               She begins to swoon and Morgana keeps her steady on her feet. 
               Arthur slumps into his seat and Sir Gawain kneels before 
               him.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         I champion this truth: That Queen 
                         Guenevere murdered Sir Gahalt with 
                         the aid of sorcery.

               Enraged, Arthur reaches for Excalibur. But with effort he 
               checks his impulse.

                                     ARTHUR
                         The Queen will be in my charge till 
                         a champion steps forward to fight on 
                         her behalf.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Not you, my husband?

               Arthur cannot look at her.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         She must be burnt at the stake. That 
                         is the sentence for murder done with 
                         magic.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It is. Lords and knights of the Round 
                         Table, as her husband I say that 
                         this deed was not done by Guenevere. 
                         Who among you will champion this 
                         truth?

               No one responds. Guenevere falls into her seat. Arthur 
               searches the eyes of his knights and they evade him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Sir Caradoc! You!

               The knight looks up.

                                     CARADOC
                         I am torn.

               Sir Ector, old and feeble, weeps for Arthur. Someone speaks 
               up. It is Perceval, who kneels before the Queen. His voice 
               is unnaturally loud, and his eyes shine with held-back tears; 
               he stutters.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will champion you, my lady.

               He is overwhelmed by his own boldness. He looks around. All 
               eyes are upon him. Guenevere smiles at him, sadly.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I thank you, but you are not yet a 
                         knight.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will find Lancelot! He will come!

               Perceval hurries from the hall. Arthur looks away, ashamed, 
               and his eyes fall on Merlin, twitching and mumbling in his 
               sleep.

                                     MERLIN
                         Boys!... boys will be boys...

               EXT. HOVEL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               In full armor but for his helmet, Lancelot is seated at a 
               small table in the shadow of a tree, eating an apple.

               A young girl is turning a chicken on a spit, and her mother 
               is removing freshly-baked bread from an oven. It is very 
               peaceful and silent until, galloping all out, Perceval 
               arrives. Frantic, out of breath, he leaps from his lathered 
               horse.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I have found you. The Queen. An apple.
                         Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...

                                     LANCELOT
                         --It must wait, child. These good 
                         ladies, for whom I intervened once, 
                         will honor me with a meal. I am 
                         beholden to them now as I was when 
                         they begged my protection.

               The two women set the chicken and the bread before the great 
               knight, and stand back to watch him eat, flushed with 
               excitement. Perceval falls silent, in awe of Lancelot.

               INT. BEDCHAMBER, CAMELOT - NIGHT

               Arthur stands hunched over the fireplace, staring into the 
               flames. Guenevere paces back and forth to a window.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Why can't you be my champion?

                                     ARTHUR
                         If I am your judge, I cannot be your 
                         champion. When I act as your King, I 
                         cannot be your husband.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         And you cannot love me...

                                     ARTHUR
                         The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, 
                         high and low, or they are not laws 
                         at all. Lancelot will come...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         And if he cannot be found, no other 
                         knight will champion me, though you 
                         beseeched each and every one of them. 
                         Why be king if there is no one you 
                         can call loyal subject but an eager 
                         boy?

               He hides his anguish from her. Numb with hurt, she goes to a 
               tall curtained window, and draws it open, and stands there 
               looking out upon the surrounding forest, silent and still 
               beneath the moon.

               EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

               She cries softly, and she whispers the name of the great 
               knight.

               EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST, WALLS OF CAMELOT - NIGHT.

               A mounted knight stands motionless at the edge of the forest, 
               his armor gleaming with dark lustre. It is Lancelot. His 
               eyes are raised to the high window, where he sees Guenevere. 
               He watches her in silence. In the high window Guenevere draws 
               the curtain and Lancelot reins back into the forest.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Lancelot has unsaddled and tethered his horse in a small 
               clearing. He sits, resting back against a tree. He removes 
               his helmet; he plants his sword before him, like a cross. He 
               loosens the ties of his breastplate. He waits for day, 
               yawning, tired. But his eyes burn, and he closes them and 
               nods off to sleep.

               A knight appears silently hovering over him. Lancelot looks 
               up, and his eyes go wide with fear. The knight towering above 
               him wears armor identical to his, and he raises his sword, 
               and the blade is descending upon Lancelot. Lancelot draws 
               his sword from the ground and rolls away, but the knight's 
               sword slices through his shoulder joint. Lancelot attempts 
               to rise but already the knight, Lancelot's mirror image, is 
               upon him. From the ground, Lancelot parries the blow and 
               slashes at the opponent's knee, cutting through the joint in 
               the armor and severing the leg.

               The knight doesn't fall, doesn't bleed, doesn't cry out. On 
               one leg he comes forward, a horror. Lancelot is paralyzed by 
               fear. As the knight leaps upon Lancelot, Lancelot rises to 
               meet him, impaling himself on the knight's sword below the 
               hauberk. He throws the knight to the ground, and comes down 
               upon him. He rips off the helmet and the breastplate. The 
               armor is empty and Lancelot rolls over on his back, awakening 
               from the nightmare with his own sword deep in his stomach, 
               and in his hand his own helmet and breastplate, while other 
               parts of his armor lie strewn around him.

               Only then does he become conscious of the terrible pain and 
               the shock of the truth. He grabs the hilt of his sword and 
               draws it from his stomach. He curls up in agony, clutching a 
               fistful of leaves to the wound.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Guenevere, I fight against myself...

               He loses consciousness.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAWN

               The Bishop blesses the field. Guenevere, numb and 
               disbelieving, is being led to the stake, which rises from a 
               bed of straw and wood. Arthur watches, in shock. Other knights 
               and ladies keep their distance, watching darkly, stealing 
               glances at Arthur, mumbling disapproval of his refusing to 
               defend Guenevere. In battle dress, Sir Gawain rides up and 
               down the jousting run on a snorting and powerful horse, 
               practicing. Perceval, in a mail doublet, waits beside a mangy 
               roan, his face burning with anxiety.

               Guenevere is tied to the stake. All eyes watch for the 
               approach of her champion. Arthur goes to Perceval.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Is he coming?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         He heard Lady Guenevere's request 
                         and he said nothing. That is all.

               Arthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               The sun has risen shining cruelly into Guenevere's eyes; the 
               queen is alone at the stake. Sir Gawain rides up to King 
               Arthur, who waits alone, separated from the others.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         My Lord, the sun is upon the field. 
                         The Queen has no champion. I demand 
                         justice, as is my right.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So it is.

               Perceval leaps onto his horse.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Let me champion the Queen!

               Sir Gawain looks at the squire with contempt.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                              (to Arthur)
                         Since no knight comes forward, I 
                         demand justice--

               Arthur is in anguish. He searches the tree line for a sign 
               of Lancelot. He looks from Guenevere at the stake to his own 
               knights watching him. He draws Excalibur. A gasp goes through 
               the crowd of onlookers.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Boy, kneel.

               Perceval leaps from his horse and bends his knee before the 
               King. Arthur brings the sword down on the boy's shoulder, 
               giving him the three strokes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         In the name of God, of St. Michael, 
                         and St. George, I make you a knight. 
                         Rise, Sir...

                                     PERCEVAL
                         ...Perceval!

               Gawain shakes his head disdainfully as Perceval mounts back 
               into the saddle, his eyes burning with fervor.

               Sir Gawain and Perceval ride to opposite ends of the field. 
               The spectators fall silent, all staring blankly, their senses 
               dulled by the tragedy, at the uneven combatants.

               A cry goes up. Lancelot rides out of the forest. He rides up 
               to the King and salutes him. Arthur smiles at his old friend, 
               tears of joy in his eyes. Lancelot bows toward Guenevere and 
               rides on to where Perceval waits.

               Lancelot reaches out to touch Perceval's cheek.

                                     LANCELOT
                         It's my task to prove the Queen's 
                         innocence.

               Perceval cannot reply, his eyes affixed on the blood that 
               trickles from Lancelot's hauberk. Lancelot raises his lance 
               in salute to Gawain across the field. Gawain salutes in 
               answer.

               The two huge knights charge at each other, each man's spear 
               tip making contact with the other's armor, and in the violent 
               collision both are unhorsed. Lancelot is slower at getting 
               to his feet and drawing his sword.

               He is bleeding below the hauberk from his self-inflicted 
               wound.

               In the first onslaught Lancelot fights defensively, falling 
               back. He has to toss aside his shield and hold his stomach 
               with his shield hand.

               Morgana watches with Merlin. Every terrible blow of sword on 
               sword reverberates through her body pleasurable. Merlin is 
               captivated by her cruel sensuality.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - LATE DAY

               They swing and thrust at each other with slower but bone-
               crushing force, both unsteady now. Blood seeps from Lancelot's 
               feet, leaving awful footprints on the earth. Finally, with a 
               daring thrust, Lancelot lifts Gawain's visor and the sword 
               tip is before his eyes. Gawain drops his sword and shield, 
               kneels and speaks in a voice hoarse with weariness.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         The Queen is innocent. I yield to 
                         your mercy, Sir Lancelot.

               Lancelot collapses in a dead faint.

               INT. CELL, CAMELOT - EVENING

               Eyes closed, Lancelot lies on a bed, naked but for a cloth 
               across his loins. His minor wounds have been dressed, and 
               Merlin is kneading the huge gash in his stomach, working the 
               severed flesh together. Guenevere stands on one side of the 
               bed, Arthur on the other, both looking down upon Lancelot, 
               relieved and not daring to look at each other.

                                     MERLIN
                         Flesh on flesh. You must press on 
                         the wound, Guenevere, hold it, and 
                         it will begin to bind.

               Guenevere kneels, and at her touch Lancelot's eyes flicker 
               open. Merlin exits, and draws Arthur away with him.

               Arthur is deeply tormented.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere 
                         is returned to me...

                                     MERLIN
                         What is it my child?

               Merlin appears moved by the predicaments that Arthur has to 
               face.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Will I have a son?

               Merlin stares off into the evening sky, where a lark sings 
               high up.

                                     MERLIN
                         Yes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, 
                         nothing but a simple yes? That 
                         frightens me.

                                     MERLIN
                         A king should be afraid, always. The 
                         enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush 
                         in the dark corridors of his castle, 
                         on the deer paths of his forest, or 
                         in the gray and winding paths of a 
                         more tangled forest, in here.

               He taps his skull and smiles.

               INT. CELL - EVENING

               Lancelot is staring into Guenevere's eyes. She opens her 
               shift, baring a breast with the innocence of a mother 
               preparing to suckle a child. She presses her breast to his 
               wound, her face to his chest, her arms enfolding him. She 
               whispers.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Flesh on flesh. I will heal you.

               His body trembles and his eyes brim with tears. He is lost.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - NIGHT

               The court is assembled, for the evening feast. There is music 
               and heavy drinking. Some knights are slouched across the 
               table. Lancelot, still weak, takes his seat, looking at the 
               drunken and frivolous knights. Arthur catches it, and they 
               smile at each other.

                                     ARTHUR
                         They miss the battlefield. I think 
                         we do too.

                                     LANCELOT
                         But one can still keep a sword sharp 
                         riding out in the name of the King's 
                         law.

               Guenevere cannot tear her eyes from Lancelot. He avoids her 
               look. Arthur looks from Guenevere to Lancelot, and speaks 
               softly to him, across her, and with stabbing directness.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It is not easy for the young ones to 
                         learn knightly virtues without the 
                         hard teaching of war and quest. It 
                         is only your example, Lancelot, that 
                         binds them now.

               Then, addressing the hall:

                                     ARTHUR
                         Which is the greatest quality of 
                         knighthood? Courage? Compassion? 
                         Loyalty? Humility? What do you say, 
                         Merlin?

               He is bent close to Morgana, whispering. Only when the hall 
               rings with laughter does he look up.

                                     MERLIN
                         What?
                              (then seeing he has 
                              an audience)
                         The greatest? They blend together 
                         like the metals we mix to make a 
                         good sword.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I didn't ask for poetry. Which is 
                         it?

               Merlin looks from Arthur to Guenevere to Lancelot to Arthur.

                                     MERLIN
                         All right. Truth. It must be truth, 
                         above all. When a man lies he murders 
                         some part of the world.

               An uneasy silence falls upon the feast. Guenevere and Lancelot 
               cannot look at each other, and Arthur feels it. Lancelot 
               jumps to his feet.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Conversation and court life don't 
                         suit me. I must take my rest in the 
                         forest.

               Guenevere stifles her dismay.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?

                                     LANCELOT
                         It is deep...

               Arthur is about to rise to embrace him, but checks himself.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You will be sorely missed. Heal 
                         yourself and come back.

               The exchange has become closely intimate, even though they 
               stand apart and speak before everyone in the large hall. 
               Lancelot leaves. Only Guenevere cannot watch.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE -DAY

               Water gurgles from a rock that is captive in the roots of an 
               ancient oak. Lancelot, in armor, reclines against its trunk, 
               the roots cradling him. He is perfectly still, drawing life 
               from the vibrant, all-enfolding forest.

               Flower petals drift on the breeze. Trees sigh. Fox and rabbit, 
               sparrow and hawk, at peace with each other, watch over the 
               knight.

               EXT. FOREST -DAY

               A horse and rider tear through the thick undergrowth. It is 
               Guenevere. The forest races past her as she gallops toward 
               the glade, brambles tearing at her flesh and clothes.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - DAY

               Lancelot gets to his feet, tense. Guenevere dismounts and 
               approaches. She is flushed and breathless from the wild race. 
               Her horse, left free, wanders over to his and grazes beside 
               it.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Why? You will destroy Arthur, and 
                         us...

               She moves closer and he thrusts out his mailed fist to keep 
               her away. She clutches it and presses the metal to her soft 
               tear-streaked cheek.

                                     LANCELOT
                         The law forbids it.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Love demands it.

               Hungry with passion, she embraces the cold unmoving armor, 
               kissing it.

                                     LANCELOT
                         There are things about love--

                                     GUENEVERE
                         --Nothing!

               He steps back, drawing his sword. He holds it up by the blade 
               between them.

                                     LANCELOT
                         By my knight's sword, I swore faith--

               And before he can finish she grabs the blade to push it aside. 
               He holds it fast. Blood streams from her bare hands. He cannot 
               prevail without cutting them deeply. He lets go of the sword, 
               and she lets it fall to the ground.

               She embraces his still and defeated hulk. She kisses the 
               metal, and sensation shoots through him, dizzying him.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Guenevere...

               He folds her in his arm, and their bodies lock together as 
               though a trap had sprung. Their mouths meet, each devouring 
               the other...

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELOT - DUSK

               Arthur and Merlin, the King desperate, the Wizard overwhelmed 
               by compassion:

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, 
                         by my beloved friend, by my knights. 
                         And by you. Perhaps most of all by 
                         you. For you made me, you forged 
                         this wretched life. And like a child 
                         tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a 
                         babbling lecher trotting after my 
                         sister...

                                     MERLIN
                         That is my destiny. I have a destiny, 
                         too...

                                     ARTHUR
                         With all your powers, you are content 
                         to be ridiculed, laughed at...

                                     MERLIN
                         My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to 
                         cheap tricks...
                              (with sudden enthusiasm)
                         Yes! I enjoy every moment of my 
                         foolishness, I join in the making of 
                         it, so no one can betray me. But 
                         you! You betray yourself.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Me? I have lived by the oath of king 
                         and knight.

                                     MERLIN
                         You betray the boy who drew the sword, 
                         the boy who saw the Dragon... the 
                         Dragon who moves close by, coiling 
                         and uncoiling, restless, looking 
                         down, waiting for the King to be a 
                         king...

               Arthur looks up and in the rolling clouds maybe, just maybe, 
               the form of a dragon is taking shape. Arthur draws Excalibur, 
               intensity animating his dead features.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I must do it myself. I must kill 
                         them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. 
                         Will you ride with me, Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         I cannot. I must not. Here I must 
                         stay.

               They embrace. Merlin is on the verge of tears, his face 
               immediately sad and finally ancient. Arthur exits.

               Morgana, who has been watching from the shadows, watching 
               from the shadows, slinks up to Merlin's side.

                                     MORGANA
                         Crazy old fool. You think yourself a 
                         kingmaker. Ha! A meddler, more likely. 
                         Look what a mess you've made of 
                         things.

               Merlin smiles knowingly at her.

                                     MERLIN
                         I? Perhaps, perhaps. I'm losing 
                         interest, Morgana... I have helped 
                         men--or meddled in their affairs, if 
                         you would have it that way--since 
                         the dawn of time. Now let them live 
                         by their own laws. Let them stand on 
                         their own feet. The gods of once are 
                         gone forever, it is time for men... 
                         Morgana, make a man out of me. Kiss 
                         me.

               He reaches to touch her lips. She cradles his hand in hers 
               and doesn't allow Merlin to kiss her. She kisses his knuckles 
               and stares into his eyes, stoking his desire.

                                     MORGANA
                         You know what I want. I want the 
                         secret of true magic, how to thicken 
                         the stuff of dreams and wishes with 
                         the flesh of the world.

                                     MERLIN
                         That I cannot.

               She breaks away, provocative, alluring.

                                     MORGANA
                         Then I will not.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Arthur and Sir Kay gallop through the forest, silently. It 
               is not a dream.  Their armor and the hooves of their horses 
               are muffled with pieces of cloth.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - NIGHT

               Only Nature will ever see their love; the creatures of the 
               air, tree and ground witness the final reality of their 
               passion and sense its unfathomable depths, singing of it in 
               a hundred languages. Lancelot and Guenevere are naked and 
               interlocked, one being, suspended in the darkness in the eye 
               of the forest.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Arthur walks soundlessly through the trees, approaching the 
               glade. The forest falls suddenly silent.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - NIGHT

               All passion spent, locked in each other's arms, Lancelot and 
               Guenevere drift off into sleep.

               Arthur comes upon them. He stands over them. He draws 
               Excalibur. Checking all emotion, he holds it above his head. 
               The ancient steel glows darkly.

               The lovers faces are serene and innocently beautiful. He 
               hesitates, tormented. His mask of anguish gives way to 
               determination and calm. He strikes the sword home, letting 
               go of it.

               He backs away, turns and disappears into the forest.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - DAWN

               The sky is red; so is the steel of Excalibur. Lancelot awakens 
               and starts at what he sees. His cry stirs Guenevere. They 
               are horrified to see Excalibur impaled in the ground between 
               their entwined bodies. It has pierced their union without 
               grazing their flesh. They leap up and back away, unable to 
               speak at first.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Why didn't he kill us?

                                     GUENEVERE
                         He has given up.

               She kneels before the sword, embracing the hilt to her breast.

                                     LANCELOT
                         The King without his sword, the land 
                         without a king...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         We are to blame.

               Lancelot stumbles into the forest, berserk with guilt. He 
               rages against a small tree, crying out, and he rips its roots 
               from the ground, the terrible tearing and renting the symbol 
               of his own inner torment.

               Guenevere sinks to the ground next to Lancelot's empty armor 
               and his abandoned sword.

               INT. DUNGEONS OF CAMELOT

               Merlin and Morgana descend winding steps cut out of rock. 
               The only light comes from the glow of Merlin's staff.

                                     MERLIN
                         When Arthur built the castle, I carved 
                         out a place for myself, where I could 
                         laugh or sleep, and no one would 
                         bother me.

                                     MORGANA
                         People make you laugh?

               He laughs.

                                     MERLIN
                         They do.

                                     MORGANA
                         Why?

               He leans close to her ear, whispering into it.

                                     MERLIN
                         They don't know how close they live 
                         to the edge of delight or disas...

               He is about to kiss her when he slips. He laughs.

                                     MERLIN
                         Happiness or horror.

               INT. CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT

               They pass through jaws of stalactites and stalagmites. Merlin 
               cracks his staff whip-like and a ball of fire billows up 
               from the tip and illuminates a cave wildly veined and 
               filigreed with minerals and crusted with growths of crystals. 
               The light goes out but the malachite and the gold, the quartz, 
               diamond and beryllium burn dully. He turns to her, suddenly 
               tall and unstooped, younger, sleek and evil.

                                     MERLIN
                         In the folds of the earth where the 
                         forces that hold the world together 
                         are more alive, my power is strongest. 
                         Here I will possess you, as a man 
                         possesses a woman. And the god, the 
                         eunuch, the mule that I was, will be 
                         no more.

               He sweeps her up into his arms.

                                     MORGANA
                         You are truly magnificent!

                                     MERLIN
                         Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant 
                         of your stupid little games? Preying 
                         on you weakness of others. That's 
                         your power, a petty evil. Mine is 
                         great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. 
                         Laughable endings...

               He deposits her on bare rock. He kisses her. She pushes him 
               away.

                                     MORGANA
                         Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the 
                         true Name of the charms of Doing and 
                         Undoing. Show me!

                                     MERLIN
                         I won't. You would misuse such power. 
                         I have paid enough for you, and I 
                         will have you.

               She leans forward and kisses his ear and whispers.

                                     MORGANA
                         Make magic, my foolish wizard. For 
                         our love. Weave a marvelous room 
                         around us, a room worthy of our 
                         coupling.

               She draws closer, kissing him deeply. He breathes heavily.

                                     MERLIN
                         What do you want? You must desire it 
                         for me to weave it.

                                     MORGANA
                         Walls of shining crystals, burning 
                         with red fire, furnishings of metals 
                         and jewels never seen by man...

               Morgana falls silent as Merlin raises a hand, majestically 
               intoning a harsh repetitive charm. The mineral veins of the 
               cave begin to glow and fog seeps out from them enveloping 
               the couple.

                                     MERLIN
                         Desire it and it will be as you 
                         desire.

               Morgana burns with intensity. Merlin utters a formula and 
               the fog coalesces around them into the shimmering presence 
               of crystal walls, fountains raining jewels, flowers made of 
               scented air, a bed of glass shot with light and covered with 
               skins of animals dead before the time of man, goblets of 
               ruby, tapestries woven of golden hair. She reaches out to 
               touch the wall and her hand plunges through the unmaterialized 
               illusion.

                                     MORGANA
                         It's only a semblance. You disappoint 
                         me.

               She begins lacing up her loosened gown.

                                     MERLIN
                         Don't touch the walls. Come close to 
                         me.

               She does, a mad hope in her eyes. She kisses his chest.

                                     MORGANA
                         Do it, Merlin, the deepest secret. 
                         Fix it with the charm of Making, for 
                         our endless pleasure.

               He utters the ancient charm, Morgana listening closely, 
               memorizing it. The illusion is all of a sudden solid.

                                     MERLIN
                         For you...

               She runs her hand across the hard crystal surface, her eyes 
               gleaming.

               From outside the wondrous room they can be seen to embrace. 
               He carries her to the magical bed where he makes love to 
               her, as they disappear from view in its effulgent light.

               She comes out through the crystal door, burning with evil 
               intent. She turns to watch him asleep in the bed.

               She utters the charm of Summoning learnt from Merlin, and 
               the room melts into an eddying carmine fog. Within it, Merlin 
               struggles to awaken from the torpor of love, alarmed.

               Outside, Morgana utters the charm of Making and the gaseous 
               mass begins to crystallize.

               Inside, Merlin is rising to his feet, breathing the red fog, 
               his movements slowing to a standstill, his mouth opening in 
               a scream of horror.

               The cloud has metamorphosed into a magnificent cluster of 
               red crystals.  Morgana peers into its facets and there she 
               sees, in fragments, Merlin's terror... an eye, the gaping 
               mouth, a clawing hand--as he is entombed in the stone. She 
               laughs in triumph.

               EXT. FOREST - CAMELOT - DAY

               Surrounded by forest, the spires and battlements of Camelot 
               rise under black storm clouds. Arthur and Kay ride back to 
               the castle.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - DAY

               The great hall is in gloom. Few knights are in attendance at 
               the table.

               Some sleep off last night's wine. Arthur approaches, haggard, 
               searching.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Has no one seen Merlin?

               Knights look up; those who meet Arthur's reddened eyes shake 
               their heads.

               Arthur leaves. A knight whispers to another.

                                     KNIGHT
                         Did you see? The King was without 
                         Excalibur...

               INT. PASSAGEWAYS, CAMELOT - DAY

               Echoing in the vaulted corridors outside the hall, the 
               knight's whisper stabs Arthur.

               The words now seem borne on the whistling wind and follow 
               the King wherever he goes in search of Merlin. He comes upon 
               a knight seducing a lady in a dark corner by the chapel door, 
               his hand under her gown. Arthur notes the sacrilege in 
               silence, and continues on his way.

               INT. BEDCHAMBER - DAY

               The wind keens. Thunder rolls overhead. Arthur enters his 
               bedchamber. He sits by the empty fireplace, a broken man. 
               Feminine hands light on his shoulders. He starts. He looks 
               up. It is Morgana. He smiles and grasps her hand.

                                     MORGANA
                         I'll weep for you, brother, for a 
                         King must not weep.

               She comes around and she kneels in front of him. Before he 
               can talk she silences him with a tender caress.

                                     MORGANA
                         Do you know what Guenevere's maids 
                         have whispered?

               He shakes his head.

                                     MORGANA
                         That when the King returned from 
                         battle...

               She begins untying the laces of his metal thigh and shin 
               guards.

                                     MORGANA
                         ...Guenevere would unlace his armor 
                         and massage the burns where metal 
                         rubbed on flesh...

               She is stripping his legs naked, gently touching the flesh 
               with her fingertips. He stares off, remembering.

                                     MORGANA
                         ...She would prepare a bath for you, 
                         mixing special ointment in the 
                         water...

               Arthur's eyes brim with tears. Morgana weeps, embracing his 
               knees. He rests his hand gently upon her head, choked with 
               remembrance, soothing her. But as she weeps, she incants a 
               charm.

               Arthur looks down upon her, and the woman who looks up at 
               him is Guenevere, a Guenevere with cold ice eyes. He is made 
               weak by desire and weakened further by magic. He holds her 
               face adoringly.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Guenevere! You are--

                                     "GUENEVERE"
                         --Don't speak. A thousand words, a 
                         hundred thousand words, would only 
                         be prologue to the truth that must 
                         be. That you, King, and I, your Queen, 
                         beget a son to bond our love and to 
                         strengthen our weak kingdom with a 
                         successor. Come, my lord...

               She draws him to the floor and upon her body, holding him 
               tightly to himself. Arthur trembles with excitement, pathetic 
               in his desperate passion.

               As he takes her, she shudders, losing control of the charm, 
               and her features change till once again "Guenevere" is 
               Morgana. She holds him in a tight embrace so that he may not 
               see her. She whispers in his ear.

                                     MORGANA
                         The moon flows in my blood to meet 
                         your seed. And already I bear him 
                         who will be King.

               Arthur wrenches himself away so he can see her, her arms 
               still around his neck. He looks down upon her, aghast, 
               incredulous.

                                     MORGANA
                         I could easily kill you, brother. 
                         But I want you to live to see our 
                         son be King. In me, the blood of 
                         Cornwall will have its revenge; in 
                         me, the blood of Uther will show its 
                         dark side.

               She presses her thumbs into his neck and he faints.

               EXT. FOREST - CAMELOT - DAY

               Morgana, with a small party, rides away from the castle 
               through the lashing storm, till they are taken from sight in 
               the folds of the forest...

               INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Lightening forks across the sky, illuminating the interior. 
               The chapel has been transformed into a place of satanic 
               worship. Held up and surrounded by hooded figures, Morgana 
               lies on the altar, her pregnant belly huge; and her features 
               are fierce with passionate intensity. She writhes in the 
               pangs of childbirth.

                                     MORGANA
                         Stand back, all of you. Through my 
                         own body I have nurtured him with my 
                         potions. I made him. I alone can 
                         give him life.

               INT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT

               Arthur enters, pale and haunted. Mass is being celebrated, 
               and some knights are present. Those not asleep whisper to 
               each other about the King. The sound of an approaching storm 
               is heard.

               As the priest raises the chalice to consecrate the wine. 
               Arthur comes down the aisle and steps onto the altar. He 
               reaches out to grasp the chalice from the priest's hands.

               INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Morgana holds aloft her beautiful newborn baby, his body 
               glistening in a flash of lightening. She is triumphant.

               INT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT.

               A bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, 
               and Arthur is knocked back violently.

               Rain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified 
               knights. They and the priest back away. Arthur is left alone. 
               He rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked. 
               He kneels before it. Steam hisses up as rain falls on it.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - DAY

               Sun streams in. Many of the knights are in attendance, in 
               full armor.

               Ladies and pages watch from dark corners. Arthur addresses 
               the fellowship.

               He holds the cracked chalice in his hands. He burns with a 
               new-found fervor.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who will ride the labyrinths of the 
                         forest, to the very root of his soul, 
                         to the very ends of the earth, to 
                         find the secret that will redeem us 
                         from the evil that has fallen upon 
                         us, and make this chalice, and 
                         ourselves, whole again?

               Gawain rises and draws his sword in salute.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         I will ride forth in the name of 
                         that quest, and commit my strength 
                         and my soul to it.

               Perceval, Kay and a few others draw their swords and touch 
               their lips to the blades in oath. Sunbeams splash off their 
               armor.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will go.

               The rest of the fellowship draw their swords in imitation, 
               but the resolution within them is not strong. Arthur comes 
               forward to Gawain.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, 
                         that we may never meet again, that 
                         the fellowship will be no more...

               He embraces Gawain, tears in his eyes. He turns to Perceval, 
               and Perceval kneels.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         We will find the secret or die.

               Arthur kisses the young knight's brow. Then he turns to Kay.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Kay, I know your heart yearns to go, 
                         but I am prisoner to my duties, and 
                         you must be to yours, at my side.

               Arthur and Kay watch the knights file out till the hall is 
               empty, the harsh song of their armor growing distant.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "For nine years they searched. Morgana's power grew in the 
               land."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. SNOWSCAPE - DAY

               Under a leaden sky, Gawain drives his horse through swirling 
               snow. He comes upon a mounted knight who is frozen in his 
               tracks. He brushes the snow from the man's face. The frozen 
               features belong to Caradoc. He slowly continues on his way.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY

               Dangling from the branches of a dead tree are a dozen dead 
               knights of the Round Table, crows pecking at the rotting 
               flesh in the chinks of armor. Perceval rides up, cries out 
               in horror, and spurs his horse away.

               EXT. MOORS - DAY

               The rotting carcasses of sheep. The crops blackened and 
               withered on the stalk. Hungry peasants head for a distant 
               hill.

               EXT, HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY

               A giant head has been carved out of an outcrop of rock, its 
               stone mouth gaping toward the sky.

               People are congregated around the mouth. Peasants and farmers, 
               they are wild with excitement, responding to drums throbbing 
               and bagpipes wailing.

               They watch Morgana, who is surrounded by knights in dark 
               armor. At her side is an angelic boy of eight, his eyes cold 
               as his mother's. Morgana is more beautiful than ever, in 
               flowing druidic robes, the gossamer silk clinging to her 
               sweat-drenched body.

               She is standing by the deep hole which forms the giant's 
               open mouth. It is covered by a tooth-like grating acting as 
               a drain for the blood of human sacrifices made there. Before 
               her is Gawain, chained and struggling against five strong 
               men who hold him. Morgana lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               Gawain's chest. The fountain of blood that gushes from the 
               great knight's body drives the crowd into a frenzy.

                                     MORGANA
                              (intoning)
                         The blood of this knight will feed 
                         the god in the earth, he is weak 
                         with hunger, and he will be made 
                         strong by this blood. Then he will 
                         plant his seed, and the land will be 
                         fertile once again.

               Gawain, his blood flowing from him and into the giant's mouth, 
               looks up in anguish. His bellowing voice is echoed and 
               amplified by the hollow beneath the drain.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Arthur, forgive me. I die without 
                         the secret. I have failed.

               EXT. MOORS - DAY

               Gawain's death cry and the din of the ritual carries to 
               Perceval's ears as he wanders through the wasteland. He draws 
               down his visor and spurs his horse forward.

               EXT. HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY

               He gallops toward the giant's head. He checks his sword and 
               lowers his lance.

               The knight charging forward on his war horse is an awesome 
               sight, but the crowd around the giant's mouth is strangely 
               unfrightened. Morgana is excited; she turns to the boy.

                                     MORGANA
                         Look, Mordred, a true prize for the 
                         giant. The lamb rides into our jaws.

               Perceval is galloping toward them when the ground gives way 
               beneath the horse, and he and the animal plunge into a pit. 
               The cheering crowd rushes to the edge of the trap.

                                     MORGANA
                              (to Mordred)
                         You must kill him, for this knight 
                         is dear to your father. You must do 
                         it and learn to enjoy your father's 
                         pain.

               Her knights drag Perceval, unarmed, into Morgana's presence.

                                     MORGANA
                         Have you found what you search for? 
                         Have you found what Arthur seeks?

               Perceval doesn't answer, defiant and hiding his fear.

                                     MORGANA
                         You haven't, or you would be smiling 
                         now in the face of death. Your quest 
                         is an impossible one.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         That it might be impossible makes it 
                         all the more necessary.

                                     MORGANA
                         Fool!
                              (to the men holding 
                              Perceval)
                         Uncover him. I'll show you the mystery 
                         of life. It's death...
                              (to Mordred)
                         Do it, Mordred!

               Holding Perceval by his limbs and hair, the men force him 
               down on the bloody grating, drawing back his head, exposing 
               his throat. Morgana kneels by his head, and draws the boy 
               beside her. She holds the tip of the dagger to Perceval's 
               neck and takes Mordred's hand and wraps it around the handle.  
               Perceval is choked with fear, his heart pounding in his 
               throat.

                                     MORGANA
                         Feel the life through the dagger, 
                         child. It belongs to you.

               The boy looks up at his mother. The vein in Perceval's neck 
               pushes against the dagger's point.

                                     MORDRED
                         I feel it, Mother. I will give his 
                         blood to the giant.

               The boy raises the dagger, and hesitates just a bit. Perceval 
               resigns himself bravely. He looks the child calmly in the 
               eye. Mordred brings down the blade without strength, just 
               piercing the skin with the tip. He lets go of the dagger, 
               afraid now of his mistake.

               The dagger clatters to the grating and slips away down the 
               drain, before Morgana can retrieve it. She rages against 
               Mordred. In the confusion, Perceval tears loose, the men 
               holding him slipping on the blood-wet stone.

               Perceval runs through the crowd. Immediately, lance lowered, 
               a knight is upon him. Perceval leaps toward him, catching 
               the lance in his hand, and pulling down the rider with it. 
               He jumps the rider and draws the knight's sword. Whirling 
               the lance and cutting the air with the sword, he keeps back 
               the other knights for a moment, giving him time to see his 
               chance. He leaps onto the riderless horse and charges off 
               through the crowd. He reins in abruptly, the horse rearing. 
               He is wary of the ground before him; there could be a hidden 
               pit. But there is no time to think. Knights and men on foot 
               are rushing him. He spurs forward into a gallop, the horse 
               striding mightily And its hind leg sinks into a pit, the 
               animal losing its gait. But the momentum carries the horse 
               forward, and it recovers from the stumble.

               Perceval gallops away.

               Morgana is enraged. She shakes Mordred by the hair.

                                     MORGANA
                         You didn't kill him! You didn't kill 
                         him!

               But suddenly she begins kissing him tenderly.

                                     MORGANA
                         My dear, sweet boy...

               He just stands there emotionless, the dead center of her 
               turbulent passions.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY

               Perceval gallops down a trail. The black-armored knights of 
               Morgana chase him.

               Perceval reins into deep cover alongside the trail. The 
               pursuers thunder past and the sound of hooves recedes. 
               Perceval checks his newly found sword, slashes the air to 
               feel the weapon's balance. He re-sheathes it. He pats the 
               horse.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         We'll become good friends.

               He starts off again, into the patchless forest of dead trees.

               He is suddenly set upon by a wildman who, swinging a small 
               uprooted tree, knocks him off his horse. Perceval crashes to 
               the ground and before he can use his sword the wildman has 
               knocked it out of his hand.

               It is Lancelot, demented, who furiously rains battering blows 
               on Perceval's armor, bellowing with rage. All that Perceval 
               can do is attempt to avoid the blows. Lancelot addresses 
               Perceval as if the young knight were Lancelot himself.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Where are you going, Lancelot, in 
                         your iron tomb? Still trying to save 
                         the world?
                              (He hammers blows 
                              into Perceval's armor)
                         The best... the bravest... the 
                         greatest... fool that ever lived. 
                         Now the world rots. Death is king of 
                         the earth. And it is you who make it 
                         so, Lancelot.

               Before Perceval can speak, Lancelot disappears again into 
               the forest, his eyes blank, as though his encounter with the 
               young knight had never happened.

               A knot of pain, Perceval pulls himself up. He tries to rise 
               into the saddle. He is too hurt to do it. He starts off on 
               foot, slowly, leading the horse.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT

               It is very dark and Perceval has to feel his way.

               He comes to the edge of a stream. He kneels to drink, and 
               the horse drinks beside him. Then he rests back on his heels, 
               brooding, too tired to rise.

               He lowers his eyes, staring into the dark water, defeated, 
               empty.

               Before him in the water a long thin bar of light appears. He 
               looks at it amazed. Voices are heard singing very far away. 
               He reaches out to touch the long strip of light but his hand 
               just disturbs the water. It is a reflection. The strip grows 
               wider and the ethereal music is closer.

               Perceval looks up. The strip of light is before him, 
               suspended, thirty feet above. It continues to grow wider. A 
               drawbridge is being slowly lowered, allowing a powerful light 
               to escape from within.

               Perceval is terrified. In pain, he slowly rises into the 
               saddle, ready to gallop off; but fascinated, hypnotized by 
               the sight, he cannot, and he stays and watches.

               The dim outline of a castle becomes visible as the drawbridge 
               is lowered across the water to the ground at his feet. At 
               the center of the blast of light coming from the castle, 
               Perceval can make out a burning chalice. The music swells to 
               a terrifying pitch, searing the forest.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO CASTLE - NIGHT

               At the sight of the chalice, Perceval masters his fear. Bathed 
               in light and music, he spurs the horse forward onto the 
               drawbridge.

               Once he is on it, the bridge begins to rise. Unsure of its 
               footing and blinded by the light, the horse becomes skittish, 
               and Perceval has to struggle to control it. He dismounts to 
               lead it, but the horse is terrified, rears up and jumps off 
               the bridge, which continues to rise, drawn up by unseen hands.

               Perceval hesitates, then advances down the sloping drawbridge 
               into the castle courtyard. All details are bleached out by 
               the blinding light. The chalice appears suspended in space, 
               and now the figure of a man can be glimpsed standing behind 
               it.

               Enchanting music from unseen singers grows and weaves. 
               Perceval looks back to see the drawbridge slowly closing, 
               trapping him inside.

               He approaches the figure, his courage ebbing. Hands cupping 
               the chalice, it speaks to him.

                                     FIGURE
                         What is the secret of the chalice? 
                         Who does it serve?

               Perceval doesn't understand. He glances back again. The 
               drawbridge is nearly closed. Terror seizes him.

               Panicked, puzzled, baffled, he backs away. He scrambles up 
               the drawbridge desperate to reach the top before it closes. 
               He claws his way up till his hand grasps the top. He heaves 
               himself through the narrow closing slit which is about to 
               crush him. He screams, and with a final effort he wriggles 
               free and topples over crashing into the water below.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT

               He looks up. The drawbridge thunders shut, the last thin 
               strip of light disappearing; and now he is surrounded only 
               by the silence of the forest.

               Where there was a castle, now there is darkness. Perceval 
               wades through the water. He has crossed the stream and all 
               he can see and feel are tree trunks. The castle has 
               disappeared. He is utterly defeated.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         The chalice. The secret was in my 
                         grasp. I let it slip, afraid for 
                         myself. A question was asked. I didn't 
                         understand. I didn't try. I failed...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "Nine years passed."

               FADE IN:

               INT. CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT.

               Dripping water is steadily encrusting the crystal with 
               limestone.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - DAY

               Dead knights lay on biers. The once glorious seat of power 
               is falling into decay. Few are in attendance around the table. 
               Agitated, Kay enters and goes to Arthur, who is worn and 
               haggard, and aged.

                                     KAY
                         Your son Mordred is at the gate.

               Arthur comes alive.

                                     ARTHUR
                         At last...

                                     KAY
                         Don't recognize him. You were trapped 
                         by Morgana's sorcery.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (staring off)
                         ...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and 
                         Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all 
                         the others--lost to me. Only the 
                         echo of their voices remains in this 
                         empty hall. All I have left is the 
                         memory of their fellowship. Echoes 
                         and memories. I am a ghost of the 
                         King that once was...
                              (he turns to Kay and 
                              with sudden harshness)
                         ...Mordred is real, alive, my own 
                         flesh and blood. I will see him, I 
                         must.

               EXT. GATE, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAY

               The drawbridge lowers slowly, and Arthur moves away from Kay 
               and the other knights, and advances across it.

               Rooks wheel over the dead trees of the forest that surrounds 
               Camelot. A group of armed men waits at the edge of the forest. 
               One steps forward, a huge knight in black armor, the metal 
               defining and exaggerating the powerful musculature of his 
               body. He is Mordred, a young man of eighteen, and of 
               extraordinary beauty. A page follows ten steps behind him 
               bearing an enormous spear, its points hooded. Arthur stops 
               at the edge of the drawbridge, the huge knight a few steps 
               from him. Kay, ready for anything, moves halfway across the 
               drawbridge.

               Mordred kneels on one knee.

                                     MORDRED
                         Father...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Rise, Mordred.

                                     MORDRED
                         I have come to claim what is mine, 
                         Father.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I recognize you only as my son, no 
                         more.

                                     MORDRED
                              (his tone is scathing)
                         And you are the great King? The lords 
                         have rebelled. Invaders attack the 
                         coasts. Crops don't grow. There is 
                         nothing but plague and hunger in the 
                         land. Only I am feared. I will be 
                         king. You may have lost Excalibur, 
                         but I have found my own weapon of 
                         power. There.

               He points to the huge lance. The page pulls a string and the 
               hood drops, revealing a diabolically sharp spear tip, its 
               metal glinting menacingly.

                                     MORDRED
                         The very spear that pierced the side 
                         of Christ as he died on the cross.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Your mother told you that?

               Mordred is thrown off by the doubt Arthur has cast. Arthur 
               looks upon his son, desperately trying to read him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I cannot offer you the land, only my 
                         love...

                                     MORDRED
                         And I offer only this, Father. To 
                         commit with passion and pleasure all 
                         the evils that you failed to commit, 
                         as man and king.

               Arthur goes forward to embrace his son, a desperate attempt. 
               Mordred recoils.

                                     MORDRED
                         We will embrace only in battle. 
                         Father, and I will touch you only 
                         with the blade of my spear.

               Arthur is on the verge of tears.

                                     MORDRED
                         I will muster a great force of 
                         knights, and I will return to fight 
                         for what is mine.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So be it.

               He turns and re-enters the castle, the drawbridge pulled up 
               immediately behind him. He is hunched over, broken.

               EXT. BARREN LAND - EVENING

               Asleep in the saddle, Perceval rides across burnt and 
               smoldering fields. The horse walks aimlessly; it is the same 
               animal, mangy and old. A hoard of children in filthy rags 
               closes in on him, begging, pulling at the horse's trappings. 
               He bolts awake and reins away. His eyes are red and feverish.

               Wild hope grips him when he sees a glinting light by a 
               farmhouse. He spurs the horse forward into a gallop.

               EXT. FARM - EVENING

               He leaps from the saddle and a terrified woman backs away. 
               Perceval plunges his hand into the source of light. It is 
               nothing but the reflection of the dying sun in a bucketful 
               of water. Perceval covers his face.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Illusions. I will never find it 
                         again... I am sorry, woman, that I 
                         frightened you.

               Peasants have emerged, surrounding him, and they hold axes 
               and pitchforks.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Good woman, do you have any food? 
                         Some water?...

                                     PEASANT
                         The little we had, we gave to 
                         Mordred's knights. He has taken this 
                         land. Tell the King that now we must 
                         look to Mordred.

                                     SECOND PEASANT
                         But we will give you some water...

               At least ten peasants encircle Perceval and he is too 
               exhausted to put up a fight. They grab him and carry him 
               away. Other peasants pull his horse to the ground, and one 
               raises and ax to kill it.

               EXT. STREAM, BARREN LAND - EVENING

               They throw Perceval down an escarpment and he rolls into the 
               fast-moving water. He is swept downstream and thrown 
               ferociously against the rocks in the stream bed, crying out 
               in pain.

               EXT. RIVER AND UNDERWATER - EVENING

               The water is deeper and Perceval is dragged under by the 
               weight of his armor. He struggles desperately to shed it, 
               half drowning.

               Exhausted, he pulls himself up onto the muddy shore beside a 
               rotting sheep carcass, and around him, the daylight dies.

               EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

               Ragged and bruised, lifeless, he stares into space.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I have lost my horse, my armor, my 
                         sword. I have lost my way. I have 
                         lost my strength. I have lost 
                         everything... I will not lose hope.

               A light bursting through the trees shines on the mud, 
               wordless, harmonies sound somewhere in the forest. Perceval 
               sets off toward the source.

               The burning light blasts into his face but he doesn't flinch. 
               The chorus builds in power. Before him, a drawbridge lowers.

               EXT. CASTLE GATE - NIGHT

               He steps onto the bridge and walks in. He crosses the 
               courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him. All details 
               of the castle are bleached out by the searing light.

               EXT. CASTLE GATE - NIGHT

               He steps onto the bridge and walks in. He crosses the 
               courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him. All details 
               of the castle are bleached out by the searing light.

               INT. CASTLE, VARIOUS

               Heading for the source of the light he ascends what seem to 
               be a staircase. He enters a hall where the chalice stands 
               suspended, burning with light, and the mysterious music swirls 
               and grows.

               Perceval approaches the diaphanous and featureless Figure 
               who stands over the chalice.

                                     FIGURE
                         Who does it serve?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You, my lord.

                                     FIGURE
                         I have waited long for you. Once you 
                         almost saw, but fear blinded you. 
                         Why am I served from the chalice?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Because you and the land are one.

                                     FIGURE
                         I am wasting away and I cannot die. 
                         And I cannot live.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You and the land are one. Drink from 
                         the chalice. You will be reborn and 
                         the land with you.

               Perceval cups his hands around the chalice to lift it. But 
               they close on nothing, and he draws back. The Figure's hands, 
               although insubstantial, grasp Perceval's and appear to hold 
               his hands around the cup.

                                     FIGURE
                         But who am I?

               Perceval begins to kneel.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You are my lord and King. You are 
                         Arthur.

               The blinding light vanishes, the music drifts away.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT

               Perceval falls to his knees before Arthur and he holds the 
               chalice, now whole again, up to the King. It fills with blood 
               from within and Arthur takes it from Perceval. He drinks. 
               And having done so, he seems to become younger and to grow 
               in strength.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I didn't know how empty was my soul 
                         until it was filled.

               Sir Kay stands by the vast fireplace where a small fire burns, 
               and only now looks up and is aware of Perceval.

                                     KAY
                         Perceval, you have returned!

                                     ARTHUR
                         Ready my knights for battle; they 
                         will ride with their King once more. 
                         I have lived through others far too 
                         long! Lancelot carried my honor and 
                         Guenevere my guilt. My knights have 
                         fought my causes. Mordred carries my 
                         sins. Now, at last, I will rule.

               EXT. WOODS AND FIELDS - NIGHT

               Arthur at the head of a small force of knights, their armor 
               shining beneath the moon, gallops through the land. Where 
               hooves thunder, the ground becomes alive with sprouts and 
               tendrils, and bare trees start to bud, and grasses to blossom, 
               the power of Nature exploding into life.

               INT. CONVENT - DAWN

               An old nun approaches the doors, upon which someone is 
               pounding loudly. She opens the peephole. It is Arthur.

                                     NUN
                         Go away. No man is allowed beyond 
                         these doors.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am Arthur.

               The old nun is amazed and starts pushing open the many bolts, 
               mumbling and agitated.

               INT. CONVENT COURTYARD - DAWN

               She leads the King, his footsteps ringing in the silent 
               cloister, past the doors to the cells. His armor is wet with 
               dew and it shines with a dull and deep luster. Nuns whisper 
               at his transit. She opens the door to a cell and Arthur steps 
               inside.

               INT. CELL - DAWN

               Candles flicker on a small altar before which a nun is 
               praying. She turns to see who has entered. It is Guenevere, 
               older, thin with self-denial, all the more beautiful. She 
               looks up at the majestic figure who stands before her. She 
               nearly swoons. He helps her to her feet, and words rush from 
               deep within him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Guenevere, accept my forgiveness, 
                         and put your heart to rest. We have 
                         suffered to long. I have always loved 
                         you, and I still love you.

               She weeps.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I loved you much, as King, and 
                         sometimes as husband, but one cannot 
                         gaze too long at the sun in the sky.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I 
                         was not born to live a man's life, 
                         but to be the stuff of future memory. 
                         The fellowship was a brief beginning, 
                         a fair time that cannot be forgotten; 
                         and because it will not be forgotten, 
                         that fair time may come again. Now 
                         once more I must ride with my knights 
                         to defend what was, and the dream of 
                         what could be.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I have kept it.

               She draws back the covers of her pallet, and there is 
               Excalibur. Arthur is overwhelmed by emotion; he can barely 
               speak

                                     ARTHUR
                         I never dared to hope all these years 
                         that it was in your keeping.

               He kneels before her and kisses her thigh. She gazes off, 
               remembering the life of long ago. He rises and looks off 
               into her eyes, unable to find the words; he finally does.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I have often thought that in the 
                         hereafter of our lives, when I owe 
                         no more to the future and can be 
                         just a man, that we may meet, and 
                         you will come to me and claim me as 
                         yours, and know that I am your 
                         husband. It is a dream I have...

               He takes Excalibur by the hilt and exits.

               INT. CONVENT COURTYARD - DAWN

               The nuns scatter before him in awe and terror. He strides 
               forward, Excalibur in hand. He stops and tests its balance, 
               and he draws force from it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Guenevere...

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               Excalibur gleams in the sunlight. Arthur holds it high, at 
               the head of a small force of knights under the banner of the 
               Dragons. Kay and Perceval ride at his side. Plumed helmets, 
               shields blazing with armorial colors, pennants flying in the 
               clean wind from their lances; it is a brave sight. The trees 
               are in blossom and dandelion fluff billows up at their 
               passage.

               EXT. PIT, MOORS - DAY

               Arthur's group comes to a halt. Two knights and a few squires 
               galloping from the opposite direction rein in before the 
               King. The knights draw their swords in homage, and the older 
               one addresses Arthur.

                                     KNIGHT
                         It is only me and my son. All other 
                         knights of the dukedom have rallied 
                         to Mordred.

               Arthur smiles hiding the hurt. He points to an open pit, a 
               huge devastation.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What horror is that?

                                     KNIGHT
                         Mordred, sir. He digs for precious 
                         metals, with which he buys the loyalty 
                         of men at arms, binding them to his 
                         side.

               EXT. THE MOORS - ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - LATE EVENING

               It is a clear night and the sky blazes with stars. A crescent 
               moon casts its silvery light upon Arthur, who wanders from 
               his camp alone.

               EXT. STONEHENGE, THE MOORS - LATE EVENING

               He stops in the ancient circle of Druidic stones.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am outnumbered ten to one by 
                         Mordred's forces. Merlin, I need you 
                         at my side as you were once, my 
                         friend, to give me courage. There 
                         are no war tricks that will fool 
                         Mordred. He was weaned on blood.

               He falls on his knees in front of the stone, tired, between 
               thinking and dreaming, and he bangs his mailed fist against 
               it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         More than I ever did, I need you 
                         now. Where are you, Merlin? Is it 
                         true that Morgana has trapped you?

               INT. CAVE BELOW CAMELOT

               The veins of crystal glow darkly, and the hammering of 
               Arthur's fist upon the stone is dimly echoed here. In the 
               red crystal, fragments of Merlin can be glimpsed, trapped, 
               frozen.

               EXT. STONEHENGE - LATE EVENING

               Arthur slips off into sleep. The stones around him distort. 
               He speaks softly, but then though the words continue, his 
               lips are closed.

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...If only you could be at my side, 
                         Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur 
                         once more...

               INT. CAVE BELOW CAMELOT

               The crystal is cracking, shards falling to the cave floor.

               EXT. STONEHENGE - NIGHT

               Arthur is still on his knees, and he sits back, looking up. 
               But the atmosphere is different, within a dream, and the 
               stones of the henge loom larger over him now.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What is this place? It is rumored 
                         Merlin, that you drew your power 
                         from these circles...

               A hand ruffles the King's hair. He turns, and is face to 
               face with Merlin, standing over him. Arthur looks at him 
               without surprise, as though the intervening years never were. 
               Merlin begins to laugh his hideous giggle. Arthur rises.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they 
                         must fight tomorrow for their very 
                         lives.

                                     MERLIN
                         I know. I have heard noises and echoes 
                         through the stones...

                                     ARTHUR
                         What is this place, Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         It is like a tree. The roots of the 
                         stones spread out across the land 
                         and they draw on the thoughts and 
                         actions of men. Like sap those human 
                         matters course through the stones 
                         feeding the stars that are the leaves 
                         of the tree. And the stars whisper 
                         back to men the future course of 
                         events.
                              (becoming passionate)
                         But the earth is being torn apart, 
                         its metals stolen, and the balance 
                         is broken and the lines of power no 
                         longer converge. In fact, I nearly 
                         didn't make it in one piece.

               He limps affectedly and stretches with exaggerated pain.

                                     MERLIN
                         But, I'm here.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Where have you been these many years? 
                         Is it true that Morgana--

                                     MERLIN
                         --Stories... You brought me back. 
                         Your love brought me back. Back to 
                         where you are now, in the land of 
                         dreams...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!

               Merlin smiles, turns and leaves, heading for Arthur's camp, 
               giggling. Arthur starts off after him and awakens from the 
               dream when he walks into one of the stones. It takes him a 
               moment to realize that Merlin has vanished.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin?!

               He hurries away toward the camp.

               INT. KAY'S TENT, ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Arthur shakes Kay awake, and as the faithful knight comes 
               out of a deep sleep, he clutches Arthur's arm.

                                     KAY
                         Merlin, will I live...?
                              (he shakes away the 
                              dream)
                         ...I was dreaming...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Of Merlin?

                                     KAY
                         Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would 
                         fight bravely tomorrow. I have never 
                         dreamed of Merlin before.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! 
                         He lives in our dreams now, in that 
                         dark and shadowy place that is as 
                         strong and real as this more solid 
                         one. He speaks to us from there.

               EXT. MORDRED'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Cape flowing, Merlin sweeps between Mordred's war tents, and 
               in the logic of dreams, unseen by the guards. He passes a 
               tent where the huge shadow of Mordred is thrown on the canvas, 
               as he sharpens the blade of a fearsome spear.

               He enters a tent.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               She is stunningly beautiful in her sleep. Merlin leans over 
               her lovely body, kisses her softly on the lips, and waits 
               for her to awaken.

                                     MERLIN
                         I have returned, enchantress. You 
                         are beautiful, magnificent. Have you 
                         used up all the magic you stole from 
                         me to keep yourself young? Have you 
                         any magic left to do battle with 
                         Merlin?

               INT. TENT - MORGANA'S DREAM

               She rises from her sleeping body.

                                     MORGANA
                         You provoke me, Merlin.

                                     MERLIN
                         What's behind that beauty? A wizened, 
                         cold-hearted snake.

               Merlin steps back, grandiose and melodramatic.

                                     MERLIN
                         You are a snake about to strike!

               He raises his staff.

                                     MERLIN
                         And I am the staff that drives the 
                         snake back.

               He lowers the staff with dreamlike slowness and she slinks 
               right up to him.

                                     MORGANA
                         Burning with the fire of desire, I 
                         am the flames that consume the staff 
                         to ashes.

               She winds her fluttering hands around the staff, and the 
               shadows they cast upon the tent give the illusion of licking 
               flames.

                                     MERLIN
                         I am the cloudburst that quenches 
                         the flames.

                                     MORGANA
                         I am the desert, where water 
                         disappears--

                                     MERLIN
                         --I am the sea, which covers the 
                         desert forever under its weight.

                                     MORGANA
                         --I am the fog and mists that rise 
                         up from the sea, escaping...

               She laughs at her cleverness.

                                     MERLIN
                         Fog and mist! You couldn't be that. 
                         You don't have enough magic.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               Morgana tosses and mutters in her tormented dream.

                                     MORGANA
                         ...I have the desire and I have the 
                         magic...

               INT. TENT - MORGANA'S DREAM

               Merlin, huge, magnetic, enfolds Morgana in his cape.

                                     MERLIN
                         You are mine at last. I am the sea 
                         and you will never escape me. Fog 
                         and Mist...!?

               And he laughs at her, suffocating her. Morgana begins chanting 
               the charm of Making, desperate--

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               --and she finishes uttering it in her sleep. Her eyes spring 
               open, and vapors issue from her gaping mouth. She screams 
               and the fog gushes out filling the tent.

               EXT. MORGANA'S TENT, MORDRED'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Fog billows out of the tent, spreading through the camp.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         A fog is rising, sir.

                                     MORDRED
                         That cannot be.

               He rises and goes out with the lieutenant.

               EXT. MORDRED'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               It is fogbound, the campfires yellow smudges within it.

                                     MORDRED
                              (to the lieutenant)
                         My mother has a sense for such things. 
                         She said there would be no fog.

               Mordred enters his mother's tent.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               Mordred enters.

                                     MORDRED
                         ...Mother?

               Morgana, withered, old, lies dead in the bed, wisps of smoke 
               rising from within her ruptured body.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - DAWN

               Arthur, with Kay and Perceval, canters through the white 
               fog. They are flanked by a phalanx of knights in silver armor.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Kay, you will lead the attack. 
                         Perceval, you will stay with me.

               Kay draws his sword in salute, elated.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Be cautious, my brother.

               He spurs forward, while Arthur reins to a halt, watching him 
               disappear. Perceval and a few knights stay behind and surround 
               the King.

                                     ARTHUR
                         In this battle there is one thing I 
                         must do, that no one else can. Find 
                         Mordred and kill him.

               Ahead, the horrible din of joined battle.

               In the swirling fog, clash of arms follows clash of arms. 
               There is confusion, for each knight is unable to see if he 
               is fighting friend or foe until they are upon each other.

               The battle becomes a series of vicious duels, a knight in 
               silver armor against a knight in black-burnished armor, just 
               glimpsed in the fog that is alive with the clang of sword on 
               shield, the pounding of hooves, the cries of the dying.

               Squires drag away their wounded knights, their young faces 
               pale at the sight of the carnage.

               Kay is unhorsed but picks himself up and mounts a riderless 
               horse, rejoining the combat although he is bleeding.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - DAY

               It is full day, and the fog blinds with its painful glare. 
               Arthur with Perceval at his side rides through the fog, 
               searching. Perceval takes up a challenge against the King. 
               He unhorses this opponent, piercing him with his lance. He 
               returns to the King's side.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         There are too many on Mordred's side. 
                         We cannot hold out much longer.

               Kay is glimpsed fighting on foot, hurt, barely holding his 
               own, but then the sight is hidden in the fog.

               Kay overcomes his opponent and stops to catch his breath. He 
               is amazed by what he sees. A knight, in old, battle-scarred 
               armor whose pieces don't match, cuts down the knights in 
               black in foray after foray, wheeling and turning in a 
               brilliant and ruthless spectacle of martial arts. He fights 
               without a shield, a lance in his left hand and sword in his 
               right.

               Kay moves away in search of Arthur.

               Arthur and Perceval watch the lone knight meting out death 
               with such terrible beauty, weaving in and out of the fog.

                                     KAY
                         He can be no other.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!

               He spurs his horse forward to join him, but Perceval is quick 
               to stop him.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         No, my lord. We seek Mordred.

                                     KAY
                         I will join him.

               Kay rises onto a fresh horse and gallops away.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - LATE DAY

               Arthur and Perceval ride alone, the accompanying knights 
               gone, the dying and the dead and the crazed horses all around 
               them.

               Squires are carrying Kay upon his shield. He is dead. Arthur 
               leaps to the ground and reaches out to touch his face, and 
               closes his eyes. He stifles his tears.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Has anyone seen Lancelot?

                                     SQUIRE
                         He lies over there, sir.

               Arthur rushes off, Perceval following on horseback.

               Lancelot is mortally wounded, blood flowing from his abdomen, 
               his eyes open but his gaze dead. Arthur falls to his side.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Squire! Here!

               But there is no one now except the dead and wounded, and 
               Perceval, who dismounts to watch over the King, sword drawn. 
               Desperate, Arthur stops the wound with his hand. Lancelot's 
               eyes are sightless, but tears spill from them.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Arthur.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lancelot, I will save you... Don't 
                         die.

               He tears off a piece of his tunic and staunches the wound 
               with it.

                                     LANCELOT
                         My salvation is to die a Knight of 
                         the Round Table.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are that and much more. You are 
                         its greatest knight, you are what is 
                         best in men. Now we will be together--

                                     LANCELOT
                         --It is the old wound, that has been 
                         opened. I have always known it would 
                         be the gateway to my death, for it 
                         has never healed. Let my heart do 
                         its job, my King, and pump me empty...

               Arthur takes Lancelot in his arms and rests his lips against 
               the knight's brow.

                                     LANCELOT
                              (a death whisper)
                         Guenevere, has she come to you, is 
                         she Queen again?

               He lies, closing his eyes, unable to look at Lancelot.

                                     ARTHUR
                         She is, Lancelot.

               A boyish smile settles over the features of Lancelot's face, 
               and he dies. Arthur holds him to his breast, his eyes shut 
               tight.

               A strong wind rises. Perceval kneels beside Arthur.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         The fog is lifting. Only we remain 
                         alive.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING

               Arthur and Perceval rise, and as far as they can see across 
               the green hills that roll down to the sea lies the aftermath 
               of the massacre. Hacked bodies, abandoned armor, steaming 
               horse carcasses, everything still. The murmur of the dying 
               is carried on the wind to the soft roar of the sea. The 
               squires have fled the scene of horror.

                                     ARTHUR
                         But for Mordred. Where is Mordred?

               Elsewhere on the battlefield, Mordred searches the dead, 
               accompanied only by his lieutenant, who turns over the bodies 
               of Arthur's knights.

                                     MORDRED
                         Where is Arthur?

               One of Arthur's knights reaches out blindly for help. Mordred 
               crushes his skull underfoot. The shaft of his huge lance is 
               caked with blood, as are his hands.

               Arthur and Perceval see Mordred and his lieutenant, and the 
               King restrains Perceval from going forward.

                                     ARTHUR
                         No, Perceval. Now it is time for me 
                         to raise my sword.
                              (he bellows out)
                         Mordred, prepare to meet your death.

               Shield on his left arm, and Excalibur in his right, he starts 
               toward Mordred.

                                     MORDRED
                         I wait for you, Father.

               Mordred advances forward, the huge spear in both hands and 
               parallel to the ground.

               Arthur goes straight for him, shield ready to receive the 
               blow. Mordred keeps walking, his arms now tensed back and 
               ready to strike.

               Once they are within weapon's reach of each other, Mordred 
               dashes forward and thrusts the spear. It glances off Arthur's 
               shield, slides under his hauberk and penetrates the King's 
               body, and so powerful was the blow that the blade pierces 
               him right through.

               Mortally wounded, Arthur's scream of pain becomes a horrible 
               war cry, and he drives himself forward with all the strength 
               he has along the spear shaft almost to Mordred's hands. 
               Mordred is knocked back and to the ground and Arthur presses 
               down on him, the butt of the spear pinning Mordred. Arthur 
               lifts Excalibur. Mordred attempts to free himself, as the 
               blade of Excalibur descends upon him and cuts through metal, 
               flesh and bone.

               Mordred's head falls to the ground, rolling away.

               Mordred's lieutenant flees. Perceval races to Arthur's side, 
               and supports the King who has fallen on his knees. Arthur 
               speaks through the pain:

                                     ARTHUR
                         Draw the spear from me. Do it.

               Perceval holds the King tight to himself with one arm, while 
               with the other he draws the shaft through and out of Arthur's 
               body. Arthur sags but doesn't fall. Perceval begins to remove 
               his armor to get at the gaping wounds. The King speaks slowly, 
               softly, from outside his own pain-wracked body.

                                     ARTHUR
                         There is one thing left to do... 
                         Excalibur... And you must do it, 
                         Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command 
                         you.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I cannot--

                                     ARTHUR
                         --Take Excalibur. Find a pool of 
                         calm water and throw the sword into 
                         it.

               Perceval, stunned by the command, doesn't move.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Obey me, Perceval. You must act for 
                         me. It is my last order as your King. 
                         Do it, and be back!

               Perceval picks up the sword, mounts his horse and rides 
               inland. Arthur watches him go, struggling with the pain, 
               still kneeling, and then his head falls to his chest.

               EXT. POOL, MOORS - EVENING

               Perceval steps through tall reeds to the edge of a pool. He 
               cannot bring himself to throw Excalibur into the water. He 
               examines the blade, and it is haloed with a faint iridescence.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         It is too precious a thing. I can't...

               He backs away from the water and hides the sword in the reeds, 
               and starts back.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING

               Perceval dismounts, rushing to kneel at the King's side. 
               Arthur looks up, calm and intense.

                                     ARTHUR
                         When you threw it in, what did you 
                         see?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         ...I saw nothing.

               The King looks at him with piercing power. Perceval blurts 
               it out.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur 
                         cannot be lost. Other men--

                                     ARTHUR
                         --By itself it is only a piece of 
                         steel. Its power comes from he who 
                         wields it. For now there is no one. 
                         Do as I have ordered!

               Perceval leaves once more. The daylight is failing, the sun 
               is near the horizon over the sea, bursting through clouds.

               EXT. POOL - EVENING

               He picks up the sword and looks at it for a long time. 
               Finally, with great misgiving, he hurls it into the middle 
               of the pool. As Excalibur is about to touch the water a 
               woman's hand reaches and grasps it by the hilt. It holds the 
               sword aloft for a moment and then draws it under.

               Perceval backs away from the pool stunned by the marvel.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - SUNSET

               Perceval returns to the King, terribly excited, shouting 
               from his horse:

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Arthur!

               But Arthur isn't there. Perceval looks around him, he doesn't 
               understand. He sees a trail of blood. He spurs his horse and 
               follows the trail down to the sea.

               EXT. BEACH - SUNSET THEN NIGHT

               There is a trail of blood and prints upon the sand left by a 
               man crawling.

               Perceval follows them toward the sea. He looks around, 
               searching, terribly distraught.

               Where the blood and prints cease, there are many footprints 
               coming from and returning into the sea. Perceval looks out 
               across the waves.

               He sees a sailing vessel rising on the swell. On its deck he 
               can make out the distant figure of Arthur, lying surrounded 
               by women, their gossamer robes rippling in the wind. The sun 
               hovers on the horizon and the ship is heading for it.

               He gallops into the waves until his horse will go no further, 
               calling out with all his strength, a futile attempt:

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Arthur! Will you return?

               The sun slips below the horizon. Night is falling, and the 
               wind whips the wavecrests. He turns from the sea and wades 
               back.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         All the knights of the Round Table 
                         are dead. Excalibur is returned. 
                         Arthur is gone. Maybe he lives, maybe 
                         he will return...

               He stops at the edge of the water. In the uncertain light 
               sky and sea become one. He draws the chalice out of a pouch 
               on his saddle, and he holds it up before him.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Only I remain, and this...

               The wind swirls and whistles mysteriously in the hollow of 
               the cup. Music grand and melancholic grows from it. The 
               chalice, etched in starlight, is the last thing that is taken 
               from sight in the enfolding darkness.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               CLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD

               Our first thought: DR. DOOM?  But it's not moving.  A
               welder's torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor
               on scaffolding.  This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up
               of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously
               extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA.  His face
               is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect).  Past sparks, we
               MOVE down to pick up...

               EXT. STREET/VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

               REED RICHARDS and BEN GRIMM head toward the soaring glass-box
               atrium of VDI Headquarters.  Designed to inspire awe, it
               does.

                                   REED
                         High open space, exposed structural
                         elements.  Obviously aimed at first
                         time visitors to create feelings of...
                         smallness, inadequacy.

               Ben glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous.

                                   BEN
                         Good thing it ain't workin... Reed,
                         what are we doing here?  This guy's
                         fast-food, strip-mall science --

                                   REED
                         This wasn't our first stop, in case
                         you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not
                         that bad.  He's just a little...
                             (seeing the statue)
                         Larger than life.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

               They move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium.

                                   REED
                         He's financed some of the biggest

                         You'd never know it.

               He motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's
               accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first

               Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders.  The last

                         Jesus.  That too?

               They reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS.

                                   REED
                         Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see --

               A receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass.

                                   FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                         Executive elevator, top floor.

                                   BEN
                         What's the price for a smile round here?

               They head for the elevator.  Reed carries a small, black box. 
               As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO --

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY

               A large, dark office.  Ben in the corner.  He yawns,
               watches...

               BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars.  Planets.  They hover in the air,
               making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         My research suggests that exposure to
                         a high-energy cosmic storm born on
                         solar winds might have triggered the
                         evolution of early planetary life.

               REED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS
               FIGURE in shadow behind a desk.  An ominous, PULSATING RED
               CLOUD covers the stars.  It washes over a hologram of EARTH.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         In six weeks another cloud with the
                         same elemental profile will pass
                         Earth's orbit.  A study in space could
                         advance our knowledge about the
                         structure of the human genome, and
                         help cure countless diseases, extend
                         human life --

               The SHADOW clears his throat.  Reed speeds up, emotional.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Give kids the chance to be stronger,
                         healthier, less prone to --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Turn it off.  Please.

               The figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness.

                                   REED
                         But I haven't fully explained my --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Yes you have... Imagination.
                         Creativity.  Passion.  Those were
                         always your trademarks.

               Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR
               VON DOOM.  35, handsome, commanding.  He looks almost...
               airbrushed.  He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk.  REED is
               on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT
               CUTBACKS.              

                                   VICTOR
                         But dreams don't pay the bills, do
                         they?
                             (a condescending smile)
                         Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. 
                         Still reaching for the stars, with the
                         world on your back.

                                   REED
                         You remember in school we talked about
                         working together.  That's what I was
                         about to explain...

               Reed presses the remote.  Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE
               slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION.  Both bear the
               VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo.  Victor smiles, more intrigued.

                                   VICTOR
                         So it's not my money you want.  It's
                         my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't
                         trust you, why should I?

               Victor is a step ahead.  Reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  Ben
               wakes up, suspicious.  Victor notices.  He notices
               everything.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         That's my job.  To stay a step ahead. 
                         To know what other men don't.

               Ben gets close to Reed, turning toward the door.

                                   BEN
                         I can't take this.

                                   REED
                             (low, quiet)
                         Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
                         
               A beat.  Victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension.  And...

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         He's right, Ben.

               They turn to see...SUE STORM (demure, stunning) standing in a
               corner...possibly for the whole presentation.  A little cold:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         It's just business.

                                   VICTOR
                         I think you both know my Director of
                         Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

                                   BEN
                         Heya Susie.
                             (under breath, to Reed)
                         One more thing he's got.

               Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes
               off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, it's been too long.

               She gives Reed a polite handshake.  Victor watches carefully. 
               Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze.  A little tongue-tied.

                                   REED
                         You're, you've, I mean, how have you
                         bee--

                                   SUE
                         Never better.

               Victor sizes them up.  He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR
                         This isn't going to be a problem, is
                         it?

                                   REED
                         Not at all.

                                   SUE
                         Ancient history.

               Victor smiles, eyeing Sue.

                                   VICTOR
                         Good.  Then you're just in time to
                         hear the great Reed Richards ask me
                         for help.
                             (to Reed)
                         You know, you made a lot of folks at
                         MIT feel like a junior high science
                         fair.  So you'll excuse me if I savor
                         the moment.

               Ben tightens.  A hard beat.  Reed sucks it up.

                                   REED
                         You back this mission, and I'll sign
                         over a fair percentage of any
                         applications or --

                                   VICTOR
                         The number's seventy-five.  And it's
                         applications and patents.

                                   BEN
                         What about his first born?

                                   REED
                             (quiet)
                         Ben, the money's not important.  We
                         could save lives.

               Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.

                                   VICTOR
                         Twenty-five percent of a billion is
                         enough to keep the lights on, isn't
                         it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth
                         mortgage on the Baxter Building.

               They look at Victor.  How does he know all this...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Deal...?

               Reed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no.  But
               Reed...drops a nod.  Done.  Victor smiles, offers a
               handshake.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Well then, to our future.  Together.

               Victor squeezes.  Hard.  His other hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

                                   REED
                         Hilarious.

               As Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor.  Wary.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

               Director of Communications LEONARD enters, checking files.

                                   VICTOR
                         If Reed's right, then this little trip
                         will double our stock offering.

                                   LEONARD
                         And if he's not...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's always right.  Good thing he
                         doesn't always know what he's got...

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

               Reed and Ben step into the elevator.

                                   BEN
                         He knew about NASA.  What if he made
                         the call to shut us down --

                                   REED
                         Ben, think about all the people we can
                         help if this works --

                                   BEN
                         Maybe you should think about yourself
                         for once.  You always let this guy
                         push you round --

                                   REED
                         We got what we wanted.  That's
                         enough.

                                   BEN
                         I know, I know.  I'm just worried
                         about what he wants... Speaking of
                         which...

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to...SUE.  She joins them.  Doors
               shut.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

                                   SUE
                         You sure about this, Reed?

               He nods, head down.  He doesn't want eye contact.

                                   REED
                         Those solar winds are flaring, but I
                         factored them into my coordinates and --

                                   SUE
                         I was talking about us.  Working
                         together.

               Sue holds her eyes on Reed.  He is clearly uncomfortable in
               her gaze.  Did the elevator just get smaller?

                                   REED
                             (thinking, talking fast)
                         Well, uh, based on our history...you
                         can handle the biogenetics, and I'll
                         focus on the molecular physics.  Or,
                         uhm, maybe I should take the biotech,
                         you work the microscopes, since you
                         have some background in electropho--

                                   SUE
                             (droll, a little annoyed)
                         Right.  That's exactly what I meant.

               She shakes her head -- same old Reed.  He looks at her --
               what did he say wrong?  Ben smiles, patting Reed on the
               shoulder.

                                   BEN
                         Way to not overthink it.
                             (to Sue)
                         So when do we leave?

                                   SUE
                         I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in
                         the morning to talk about resources
                         and crew.

               She offers a business card.  Reed doesn't take it.

                                   REED
                         I, uh, think I remember the number.


                                   SUE
                         It's been changed.

               Beat.  Ben grimaces.  Reed takes the card, his eyes down.

                                   REED
                         As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could
                         pilot the mission --

                                   SUE
                         Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,
                         but we already have a pilot on our
                         payroll.  You remember my brother
                         Johnny...

               Off Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY

               A helicopter shot through trees.  We soar over timberland,
               and find something massive looming on the horizon:

               A SPACECRAFT.  A sleek take on a space shuttle.  Modern tech
               combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford. 
               The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. 
               WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred
               foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.

               EXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY

               Ben stares up at the craft.  A sneer on his face.

                                   BEN
                         Can't do it.  I cannot do it.

                                   REED
                         External SRBs, orbital system engines. 
                         Its just like the shuttles you flew
                         in --

                                   BEN
                         No.  I cannot take orders from that
                         underwear model.  That wingnut washed
                         out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria
                         Secret wannabes into a flight 
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         Youthful high spirits.

               They walk toward the base of the scaffolding.

                                   BEN
                         They crashed it into a wall.  A flight
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         I'm sure he's matured since then.

               CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. 
               PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's
               driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.  PICK UP
               Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         When have I asked you to do something
                         you absolutely said you could not do?

                                   BEN
                         Five times.

                                   REED
                         I had it at four.

                                   BEN
                         This makes five.

               INT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Reed and Ben unpack gear into lockers.  Suddenly --

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Captain on the bridge!

               Ben goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with
               a digital camera.  Then advances, as Ben realizes who it
               is...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick:
                         $59.  The look on your hard-ass former
                         CO's grill when he finds out he's your
                         junior officer: priceless.

               Ben eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. 
               Johnny flinches.  But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper,
               adjusts his uniform.

                                   BEN
                         I can handle the ship.  I can even
                         handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I
                         don't know if I should be flying or
                         playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the
                         hell came up with them?

                                   SUE
                         Victor did.

               Sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying
               a stack of flightsuits.  She hands them out to the guys.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         The synthetics act as a second skin,
                         adapting to your individual needs to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Keep the hot side hot, and the cool
                         side cool!

                                   REED
                         Wow.  Fantastic.

               Reed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit.  She wonders,
               maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Material made from self-regulating
                         unstable molecules.  I've been working
                         on a formula for this.

                                   SUE
                         Great minds think alike.

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         Guess some think faster than others.

               Victor enters, wearing his custom-tailored flightsuit.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         I hired Armani to design the pattern. 
                         These colors will look great on
                         camera.

               A DOOR OPENS.  Leonard enters, in a sharp suit.

                                   LEONARD
                         They're ready for you, sir.

                                   VICTOR
                         Showtime.

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - HALLS - NIGHT

               Leonard leads Victor through the halls.  Victor checks
               himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.

                                   LEONARD
                         Our numbers are through the roof.  The
                         IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a
                         share.  The bank's five times
                         oversubscribed --

                                   VICTOR
                         It's not just the money.  I could make
                         money in my sleep.

                                   LEONARD
                         Then what is it?

                                   VICTOR
                         History, Leonard.  History. 
                         Everything else is conversation...
                             (a beat)
                         How's the other matter?

               Leonard pulls out a BOX.  Opens it: a TEN KARAT DIAMOND RING.

                                   LEONARD
                         Harry Winston sends his regards.

               They hit a set of big doors.  Victor stops and looks into the
               reflective, metallic surface on the wall.  He fixes one last
               strand of hair.  Perfect. Then he opens the door to... 

               SNAP!SNAP!SNAP!  WHIP-PAN a row of CAMERAS snapping shots of --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - NIGHT

               Retrofitted into a makeshift press area.  Victor sits on a
               platform, with reporters stretched out below him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Today we stand on the edge of a new
                         frontier.  In the furthest depths of
                         outer space...we will find the secrets
                         to inner space.  The final key to
                         unlocking our genetic code lies in a
                         cosmic storm...

               BEHIND THE ACTION: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk past.  News
               crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture. 
               Our "Fantastic Four" are not exactly big news.  Not yet.

                                   BEN
                         Isn't that your speech?

                                   REED
                         He's made a few changes.

                                   BEN
                         This is your dream, Reed.  You should
                         be the one up there.

                                   REED
                         Victor's better at these things.

               Just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,
               waiting.  This is DEBBIE, Ben's fiancée.  And for the first
               time in the entire film...Ben SMILES.  They hug, kissing. 

               Johnny and Reed watch.  Reed glances at Sue, who walks ahead. 
               Debbie slips a photo into Ben's flightsuit.  A tender beat.

                                   BEN
                         I'll be watching over you.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Just get back soon, or I start looking
                         for a new groom.

               Ben looks at the little ENGAGEMENT RING on her finger.

                                   BEN
                         Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that
                         in for a bigger rock.

                                   DEBBIE
                         I don't care about rocks, I care about
                         you.
                             (to Reed)
                         You bring him back in one piece, or
                         you can forget being Best Man.

               Reed nods, smiles.  Debbie gives Ben a last kiss.  Ben turns
               to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile.

                                   BEN
                         What the hell you smiling at?  Just
                         keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
                         those SMBs --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Actually, the engines are SMEs.
                         Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. 
                         Couple generations past your last
                         ride.
                             (at the threshold)
                         I'm not as dumb as you look.

               Ben just glares at Reed.  This is going to be a long trip. 
               As they follow after Sue, we CUT BACK TO --

               VICTOR ON STAGE

               Mid-speech.  Playing behind him is REED'S HOLOGRAM: stars
               give way to a pulsating red cloud...

                                   VICTOR
                         Think of a world without genetic flaws
                         -- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
                         breast cancer...

               Ben and Reed hear the speech.  Ben bristles.

                                   BEN
                         What's wrong with being bald...?

               Victor smiles at the crowd, commanding.  A true leader.

                                   VICTOR
                         Darwin discovered evolution.  Now we --
                         I -- will define it.  Only in America
                         could...

               The red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the Earth.

                                   VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         ...a little country boy from Latveria
                         build one of the biggest companies in
                         the world, and truly reach the stars. 
                         Now if you'll excuse me, history
                         awaits...

               On those words, the HOLOGRAM TRANSFORMS TO...Von Doom's
               SHUTTLE on the launch pad.  BOOM!  THRUSTERS FIRE WHITE HOT. 
               Smoke billows across the pad.  Ready for take off.

               Victor walks past the hologram and exits.  His departure
               perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.

               We push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves
               Earth's atmosphere.  BOOM -- booster rockets fall away and
               the shuttle fires its thrusters.  The hologram transitions
               to...

               A shot of the SPACE STATION high above the Earth.  The
               shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with
               engines afire.  As the shuttle approaches the station we CUT
               TO --

               EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME

               THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above
               Earth.  THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME

               Victor and Sue lead the others into the command center.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (a "dad voice": to Ben)
                         If you behave, maybe next time
                         daddy'll let you drive.

                                   BEN
                         Keep talking, there won't be a next
                         time.

               Reed is focused on THE EARTH.

                                   SUE
                         Long way from the projection booth at
                         the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

               Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would
               bring that up.  It's the first time she's been nice to him so
               far.  He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with
               Sue.

                                   REED
                         Yes.  Yes it is.

               Johnny and Ben exchange a look.  Reed keeps looking at the
               stars, eyes wide, like a little kid.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               They enter the nerve center of the space station.  Victor
               goes to a computer console on the observation deck below. 
               The windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe.

                                   VICTOR
                             (to ground; via comm-link)
                         Leonard, how's the feed?

                                   LEONARD (V.O.)
                         Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

               Victor glances at a camera mounted into the console.

                                   SUE
                         We can monitor the cloud's approach
                         and observe the tests from here.

                                   BEN
                         Is it safe?

                                   REED
                         The shields on the station should
                         protect us.

                                   BEN
                         Should?

                                   VICTOR
                         What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million
                         dollars worth of equipment not enough
                         for you?

               Ben turns to Victor.  A little tension.  Reed cuts it:

                                   REED
                         Let's start loading those samples. 
                         Get your suit ready, Ben.

               Victor keeps his eyes on Ben.

                                   VICTOR
                         So you still do all the heavy lifting?

               Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Maybe you should have stayed back in
                         the lab.  Field work never suited you.

               Reed doesn't defend himself.  Ben steps up.

                                   BEN
                         He does the talking.  I do the
                         walking.  Got it?

               Victor holds tight to his smile.  He nods, condescending.

                                   VICTOR
                         Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm
                         going to borrow Susan for a second.

                                   REED
                         Sure.

               Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO --

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - LATER

               Ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots. 
               Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart,
               each containing a variety of plants.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me your dawg's not trying
                         to rekindle things with my sister.

                                   BEN
                         'Course not.  Strictly business.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

                                   BEN
                         Hey, two hearts got busted last time. 
                         Maybe she's not over it either.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the
                         year, more coin than God?  Or Reed,
                         the world's dumbest smart guy worth
                         less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's
                         a toss-up.

                                   BEN
                         Put your tiny little mind at ease.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Don't you wander off, boy.

               Johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.  He
               looks through a small window to see Ben give the thumbs up. 
               THE AIRLOCK DOOR opens, and Ben gracefully steps into space.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Sue descends the stairs at Victor's behest.  Joins him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

                                   SUE
                         I understand the business reasons.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, when you're looking at your
                         future, it never hurts to find closure
                         about the past.

               Sue's eyes narrow.  What is this about...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Susan, every man dreams that he'll
                         meet some woman he can give the world
                         to.

               He presses a button and the observation deck's outer windows
               open up, revealing a spectacular, romantic view of the EARTH.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

               While she stares out the window, Victor reaches into a
               pocket, revealing a RING BOX.  Sue looks unsettled.

               INT. SPACE STATION - NEARBY CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

               Reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall.  The
               results of his calculations are not what he expected... He
               sees WIND VELOCITY digits rise.  He does a double-take when
               he sees the readout: EVENT THRESHOLD, T-MINUS 10:00.

                                   REED
                         No...no...impossible.  It's...too
                         fast.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Behind his back, Victor holds the ring box in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         You've been with me two years now.

               Sue doesn't know where this is going.  She treads lightly.

                                   SUE
                         It's been a good two years, Victor...
                         The company's accomplished so much.

                                   VICTOR
                         Right, of course, the company... But
                         you see, I've come to realize all the
                         accomplishments in the world mean
                         nothing without someone to share them
                         with --

                                   SUE
                         Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done
                         something to make you think...

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of
                         taking big steps.  And this is the
                         biggest step yet.  If it helps, think
                         of this as a promotion.  A merger of
                         sorts...
                             (getting closer)
                         Four little words that can change our
                         lives...

               He is about to spring the ring on her.  She looks like a deer
               in headlights.  She opens her mouth, and...WHAM!  Doors slam
               open.  REED RUSHES INTO THE ROOM.

                                   REED
                         The cloud is accelerating!

               Victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I don't know what happened.

               Sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify Reed's
               claim.  Starts punching buttons.  Confirms Reed's findings
               with a nod.  Victor hardens, in control.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         We've got minutes until it hits, not
                         hours...Victor, that storm's deadly --
                         the radiation's lethal.  We need to
                         abort.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all
                         this way to lose our nerve at the
                         first little glitch.  Just close the
                         shields...

                                   REED
                         Ben's still out there --

                                   VICTOR
                         So reel him in.  But we came here to
                         do a job.  So let's do it.  Quickly.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

               Ben is carefully arranging SAMPLE BOXES OF PLANTS.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben, we need you back inside.

               Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         I ain't done arranging your flowers,
                         egghead.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around.

               Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him.  Ben
               turns and sees: THE COSMIC STORM, rumbling toward the
               station.  Not close, but not far.  That gets Ben's attention.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         Roger that, on my way.

               He turns back towards the ship.  BEHIND HIM, the storm grows.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME TIME

               Victor rushes into the room, looks at the monitors.  Sees the
               others near the airlock on one screen, and the approaching
               cloud on another.  Anxiety creeps across his face.

                                   AUTOMATED VOICE

               Reed and Johnny stand by the airlock, waiting for Ben.  They
               heard the automated voice.  It panics Reed.

                                   REED
                         Come on, Ben, come on...

                                   VICTOR (ON RADIO)
                         Reed, we're running out of time.

               EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

               A wake of turbulence from the cloud hits Ben, making it
               harder to maneuver.  The cloud's tendrils snake toward him.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               They can see Ben outside the window, still twenty yards away. 
               The entire corridor rumbles.  Lights flicker and spark.  They
               watch helplessly.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               Sue watches the monitor, also helpless.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny... Reed...

               Victor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to
               Sue.  Practically shoves her aside as he hits the INTERCOM.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed, you need to get up here so we
                         can close the shields!  Now!

               Sue glares at Victor.  His lack of compassion shocks her.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Not until Ben is back inside!

                                   VICTOR
                         It's too late for him, and soon it'll
                         be too late for all of us.

               Victor doesn't bother to wait for a response.  He takes over
               the console, punching keys.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing?

                                   VICTOR
                         Raising the shields.

                                   SUE
                         You can't leave them out there.

               Sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.

                                   VICTOR
                         Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You
                         can't help them any more than I can.

               Beat.  She takes a step toward the door.  Not sure what to
               do.

                                   SUE
                         I can try.

               With one final glare, she bolts from the room.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               Reed bites his lip.  Thinks.  He decides.

                                   REED
                         Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the
                         command center.  Close the shields.
                         
                                   JOHNNY
                         What about you?

               One look from Reed tells Johnny, he won't leave without Ben. 
               Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage.  He's not going either.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (to Ben)

               INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Victor watches the shields slide down.  Alone.  An island.

               The exterior air lock door slides open.  In agonizing,
               weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside. 

               The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a
               hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange
               stains.  Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.  Ben
               hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.

               Reed opens a first aid kit, grabs a thermo-elastic blanket...

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               Clutching the diamond ring, Victor stands defiantly.  Showing
               absolutely no concern for the others.  Interested only in the
               event itself.  Lights and equipment FALL, CRASHING around
               him.

               A control panel EXPLODES in Victor's face.  He jumps back,
               and into the falling equipment.  Collapses under the weight.

               Sue rounds a corner, sees Reed and Johnny.

                         FIVE...FOOOOUUUR...

               SLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as:

               -- JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel.
               -- REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door.
               -- VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket.
               -- THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin.

               SLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a
               SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben
               in the back, ripping through his suit.  The exterior door
               shuts and seals.  The station loses all power.  DARKNESS.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - DAY

               As quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away,
               leaving the space station intact.  Power quietly flickers on. 

               Silence.  Time resumes.  All four pick up exactly where they
               left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them.

               INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Victor emerges from the rubble.  He stands, checks his body. 
               A few scrapes, nothing serious.  A thin, throbbing CUT on his
               head.  He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding.

               INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY

               Reed and Johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door. 
               Sue joins them, as they pull Ben in.  They try to remove his
               helmet.  We don't see his face, but he's clearly unconscious.

                                   REED
                         He's not responsive --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Ben!  Ben!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               A BLACK SCREEN:

                                   JOHNNY'S VOICE
                         Ben, wake up!  Wake up!

               SUBJECTIVE CAMERA, BEN'S POV: The blurry image of Johnny
               comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Where...where am I?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Back on Earth.  Victor's medical
                         facility... We're in quarantine.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Reed? ... Sue?

                                   JOHNNY
                         They're fine.  Everybody else...is
                         fine.

               Johnny looks away, as if he can't bear to lay eyes on him.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         What's wrong with me?

                                   JOHNNY
                         I swear to you they've done everything
                         humanly possible.  The best plastic
                         surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had
                         the best --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Give me a mirror...

               Johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before Ben can
               reach it, reluctant to give it to him.

                                   JOHNNY
                         They said that's not such a good idea,
                         the shock alone could --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Give me the god damn mirror!

               Ben grabs it from him.  Then slowly raises it to look and see
               that...except for some serious stubble, Ben's totally normal.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Unfortunately, the doctors just
                         couldn't do anything to fix your face!

               He cackles as he heads for the door.  Ben heaves the mirror
               at him, breaking it into hundreds of pieces.  He turns to the
               side-table, and grabs that picture of DEBBIE.  It calms him.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING - DAY

               A modern facility of glass and stone, nestled in the forest. 
               In stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Reed walks down the hall.  His hair is GRAYING at the
               temples.  He passes Johnny, who is smiling, still enjoying
               his joke on Ben.  Johnny slows, looking at Reed's hair.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice 'do.  Going for the "grandpa"
                         look?

               Reed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs.  He
               keeps going.  He passes a partially open door.  He stops when
               he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed.  He sees a vase of
               flowers.  He grabs a couple lilies, and enters.

               But Reed sees...the room is already FILLED with expensive
               flowers.  All from VICTOR.  Reed is trumped once again.

               A DOCTOR writes on Sue's chart.  A wall TV plays a press
               conference with Victor, outside the FACILITY.  He looks worse
               for wear.  A few hairs out of place, and a small BANDAGE on
               his face.  We PUSH INTO the press conference --

                         Franklin never went out in a storm?
                         Without risk, there's no reward.

               Victor pauses.  For the first time.  Just a flicker.

                                   VICTOR
                         And you'll have it.  I've never come
                         up short.  And I'm not going to start

               Reed mutes the television.

                         How's she doing?

                         Stable.  Vitals are strong.

               Reed takes the clipboard, looks for himself.

                         Blood panels show no irradiation. 
                         Good.  You'll step up this protocol,

                         Four hours.  We know what we're
                         doing... One more day of observation,
                         then you're all cleared. 

               The Doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out.  Reed steps to
               Sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand.  Quiet:

                                   REED
                         Sue...I want to tell you...I'm...

               WHOOSH.  A NURSE rolls in with a tray bearing ten more
               extravagant bouquets.  Reed looks resigned.  He walks out.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         She's allergic to orchids.  Put that
                         Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The
                         African lilies?  They're her
                         favorites.

               Reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash. 

               Sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               A SEXY NURSE wheels a testing station into Johnny's room. 
               He's stripped down to Calvins, changing into a ski outfit.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         And where do we think we're going?

                                   JOHNNY
                         I don't know if "we've" noticed, but
                         the sickest runs this side of the Alps

                         you're not allowed to leave until we --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Finish the tests, I know -- could you
                         give me a hand with this zipper?

                                   NURSE
                         You know this is not a ski resort.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not yet.

               Johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful
               fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  In the blink of
               an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Luckily grandma still sends care
                         packages.

               The nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up.

                                   NURSE
                         You are trouble.

                                   JOHNNY

                         Brubbles my Triddle Name.

               They both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital
               read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         You're hot!

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         I mean, you feel a little feverish.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I've never felt better in my life. 
                         When do you get off work?

                         My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. 
                         That'll give you a minute to freshen
                         up.

               He hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the
               door.  The machine beeps: Johnny's temperature is 209
               DEGREES.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL PATIO - DAY

               Ben finds Reed on a patio with a panoramic view.  Reed works
               at a laptop computer.

                                   BEN
                         How long was I out?

                                   REED
                         Three days.  I was worried about you. 
                         How are you feeling?

                                   BEN
                         Solid.

               Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         How you doing?

               Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.

                                   REED
                         I don't know.  I just keep going over
                         and over the numbers.

                                   BEN
                         Reed.  Even you can't compute every
                         little thing.

                                   REED
                         I should have done more, run more
                         tests --

               Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.

                                   BEN
                         It was a freak of nature.  Last I
                         checked, you don't have a crystal
                         ball.  Let it go.

               Reed considers.  But he can't let it go.  He opens his
               computer back up, returning to work.  Ben shakes his head,
               looks out at the view.  His eyes catch on something, wheels
               turning.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You go through something like this,
                         makes you appreciate having the right
                         woman in your life.

                                   REED
                         Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --

                                   BEN
                         Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE.

                                   REED
                         What?  Come on.  She's got a good
                         thing with Victor --

                                   BEN

                         your screws?

                                   REED
                         He's smart, powerful, successful --

                                   BEN
                         Well maybe you should date him.

               Reed looks at Ben, resigned.

                                   REED
                         Ben.  He'll give her the life she
                         deserves.  She ended up with the right
                         guy.  Things worked out for the best.

               Reed steps away.  Ben stands alone, an idea sparking.

                                   BEN
                         Do I have to do everything myself?

               INT. HELICOPTER/EXT. MOUNTAIN SUMMIT - DAY

               The chopper hovers over this pristine peak.  JOHNNY and his
               NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear. 
               Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.

               His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out. 
               Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation.  They
               look down at a death-defying black diamond run.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Me like-y.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Stay right.  Left is trouble.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I though we went over this.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Last one down springs for room
                         service.

               She pulls down her goggles, jumps out.  Johnny drops out
               after her, hitting the snow.  He smolders: literally.  The
               snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.

               He takes off after her and the chase is on:

               EXT. BLACK DIAMOND RUN - DAY

               The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in
               and out of the trees through deep powder.  Johnny's a speed
               freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them. 

               Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire,
               flies off.  Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.

               The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even. 
               She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         You're on fire!

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not this again --

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         No: You're ON FIRE!

               Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm. 
               His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire. 
               A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.

               Nurse loses concentration, falls.  Johnny races away like a
               missile, screaming in exhilaration.  He looks back -- no
               nurse.

               He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally
               VEERS to the LEFT.  He fails to notice the giant CHASM in
               front of him.  He faces forward and...

               SCREEAAMMS!  LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying
               to catch ground.  FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS
               towards the rocks below.  He tries to will his body away. 

               Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame.  He is a HUMAN
               TORCH!  And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving
               him some kind of...LIFT.  He maneuvers just over the rocks,
               almost making a 90 degree turn.

               He looks back at the rocks in disbelief.  But the lift
               doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a
               snowbank.

               He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't.  He's trapped
               under snow and ice.  With all his strength, he tries to move,
               NO DICE.  Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around
               quickly begins to melt.  Johnny is on fire, and within
               seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the
               water.

               The nurse races toward the steam.  Scared, panicked.  She
               finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot
               tub, staring at his hands.  His body.  Exhilarated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Care to join me?

               She smiles and unzips.  The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               On an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, Victor
               prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about. 
               He checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.

                                   VICTOR
                         How's the IPO?

                                   LEONARD
                         Stable.  We're looking at low
                         twenties.  It's a good number,
                         considering the fallout from --

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's disaster.  You know, I half-
                         think he did this to me on purpose.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

               But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,
                         cover of the Journal...
                             (staring into silver tray)
                         I've got to do something about this
                         scar.  Make sure they only shoot my
                         right side.

                                   LEONARD
                         Actually, uh, people seem to think the
                         scar "humanizes" you.

                                   VICTOR
                         And that's a good thing?

               Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.  It
               glistens in the silver tray.  His eyes are bloodshot,
               sleepless.

                                   LEONARD
                         You know, maybe you should get some
                         rest --

                                   VICTOR
                         Later.  First, I've got some
                         unfinished business.  A deal that
                         needs closing...

               Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread.  A beat.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? 
                         You could have any woman in the world
                         but --

                                   VICTOR
                         That's why.  Because I could have
                         any other woman... You know, when
                         they asked Caesar "why England," he
                         said, "because it's not mine."

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

               Two dozen EMPLOYEES sit and eat.  Others serve themselves at
               the buffet.  Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall --

                                   SUE
                         I can only stay for one drink, Ben. 
                         I've got to meet with Victor.

                                   BEN
                         Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

               They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Hey Reed, what are you doing here?
                             (before he can answer)
                         Great, why don't you join us?

               He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. 
               Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the
                         buffet.

               Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING

               The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The
               room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp
               on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.

                                   BEN
                         Pardon me...

               Sue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again.

                                   REED
                         Are you alright?

                                   BEN
                         I think I need to lie down.  Bad
                         shrimp.

               This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,
               unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Really bad shrimp.

               ANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat. 
               A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this
               woman.

                                   REED
                         Feeling better?

                                   SUE
                         Yes, thanks.

                                   REED
                         That's good.  That's uh...good.

                                   SUE
                         You always had a way with words.
                             (an awkward beat)
                         I should be getting back.

               Sue gets up to leave.  Exasperated, Reed tries to think of
               something, anything, to say.

                                   REED
                         I'm really happy for you and Victor.

               She slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more.

                                   SUE
                         You're happy for me and Victor.

                                   REED
                         I can tell you guys are enjoying what
                         was the best part of our relationship --

                                   SUE
                         Which was?

                                   REED
                         Passion.

               We see surprise on Sue's face, and...

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         For science.

                                   SUE
                             (frustrated)
                         You are such a dork, Reed... You never
                         got it and never will unless it's
                         explained to you in quantum physics.

               As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around
               her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.

                                   REED
                         What?  What did I say?

               She looks more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         It's never what you say.  It's what
                         you don't say. What you don't do...

               She lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt --
               she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.

                                   REED
                         I...I...I just wanted to --

               As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.

                                   SUE
                         It's been two years, and all you can
                         say is you're happy for me and some
                         other guy...
                             (standing up, hurt)
                         You know, Victor may be a lot of
                         things, but at least he's not afraid
                         to fight for what he wants...
                             (Reed looks down)
                         And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. 
                         To be heard...seen... Reed, look at
                         me.

               He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her
               cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue...?  I can't.

                                   SUE
                         What?  What do you mean you --

                                   REED
                         Sue...look at your hands.

               She raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a
               medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her
               clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.

               Sue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a
               GLASS off the table...

               SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed
               instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two
               feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- 

               Then snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in
               disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue
               reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         You guys will not believe what just
                         happened!

               They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for
               the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               CLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides
               out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair
               to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He
               PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR. 

               It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor
               peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. 
               Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING

               DOUBLE DOORS burst open.  Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently
               walk.

                         It has to be the cloud.  It's
                         fundamentally altered our DNA.

                                   REED
                         Let's not jump to conclusions, we need
                         a massive amount of evidence before
                         making that leap.

               Reed glances over his shoulder.  He stares.  Sue follows his
               gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire.  He SNAPS his
               fingers.  They GO OUT.  He's totally unharmed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Now what is up with that?

                                   REED
                             (deadpan)
                         The cloud has fundamentally altered
                         our DNA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?

                                   SUE
                         Apparently I can disappear.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me you go silent too. 

               Only one thing on Reed's mind --

                                   REED
                         We have to find Ben.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive
               bursts of flame.  He turns it on and off, like the "CLAPPER."

                                   JOHNNY
                         Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame
                         off --

                                   SUE
                         Johnny.

               He does it again.  Flame on, flame off.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Stop it.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay, "mom."

               Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the
               banging, moaning and pleading inside.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my
                         nurse!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Ben, are you there?

               A creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and
               gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the
               contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough
               and craggy.  SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         Open up Ben, we need to talk.

               It all stops.  A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way
               and it crashes to the floor.  Under the covers, he groans in
               pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:

                                   BEN
                         LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed decides they can't wait any longer.  He kneels to the
               floor.  He concentrates, not sure if it will work...
               Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE
               DOORJAMB.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed's arm wriggles under the door.  It bends upward, swiping
               clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob.  Rubbery fingers
               find the latch and unlock the door.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed focuses, and pulls.  His arm snakes out from under the
               door and snaps back into place.  His flesh and bones
               reforming before their eyes.  Johnny stares at Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting.

               They hear a tremendous SMASH from inside the room.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               They open the door.  The room is trashed.  Every stick of
               furniture smashed to splinters.

                                   REED
                         ...Ben?

               Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used
               to be.  They rush to it.  Looking out they see SOMETHING
               LARGE in the distance, running away.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What is that thing?

                                   SUE
                         I think that thing is Ben.

               Reed looks out, emotions roiling.  Is that his best
               friend...?  Suddenly, Victor comes around the corner (bandage
               bigger).

                                   VICTOR
                         What's going on?

                                   SUE
                         Victor, are you feeling alright?

               He considers, but never shows weakness.  He nods.

                                   VICTOR
                         Just a little banged up.  A couple
                         scrapes.  Why?

                                   REED
                         Ben did this.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben did this?

                                   REED
                         He's had some kind of...reaction to
                         exposure from the cloud.  And he's not
                         the only one.

                                   SUE
                         We need to find him.

               Victor redirects his attention to Sue.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Victor, I'm sorry I --

                                   VICTOR
                             (cold)
                         Just find him.

               Victor strides off, leaving the others.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Anybody know where the big guy's
                         going?

               We PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed
               knows exactly where Ben is going.

                                   REED
                         He's going home.

               EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

               A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. 
               CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo
               trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where...

               A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide
               open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or
               someTHING barrels into the night.

               EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking
               glass.

               INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip,
               shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large.

               EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben.

               CLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but
               they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more
               and more frustrated.  He manages to press "0" with his pinky.

                                   BEN
                         Hello, Operator?

               Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a
               modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees
               Debbie grab the phone.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Deb... It's me.  I need you to step
                         out front.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Out front?  You home, baby?  I got
                         a surprise for you.

               He blinks hard.  Sad, dark.

                                   BEN
                         I got a surprise for you too.

               EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT

               Debbie steps out.  There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the
               door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something
               shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Ben?

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Don't come any closer for a sec.  This
                         is gonna be kind of a shock... You
                         remember when we said "together
                         forever no matter what"?

                                   DEBBIE
                         Baby, you're scaring me.

               A hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE
               HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he
               once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.

               Debbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to
               think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to
                         Ben?

                                   BEN
                         Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

               He reaches out.  She recoils.  It's too much for her.  Tears
               swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away.

               He takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over
               her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a
               halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!

               Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he
               has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time
               he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist.

                                   BEN
                         I love you, Deb.

               With that, he turns away.  The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters,
               falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on
               around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.

               INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY

               Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: "VDM" emblazoned
               on a gold plate.  Leonard waits not-so-patiently.

                                   VICTOR
                         Make sure you find Ben, bring him back
                         here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't
                         need this to hit the press.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at
                         eight, then a nine-thirty interview
                         with the Journal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Front page?

                                   LEONARD
                         Top left, like you asked.
                             (a smile)
                         Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who
                         knows...maybe Washington.

               Victor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Leonard.  Think bigger.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               We swoop toward this epic monument.  On a steel girder above
               the road, we see...a STATUE.  BEN.  He sits on the edge of
               the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,
               muttering.

                                   BEN
                         A few days in space, it'll be great,
                         what's the worst that could happen?

               A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on
               his shoulder.  Ben just glares up at the heavens.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Perfect.  Thanks.

               He hears the sound of someone SOBBING.  He turns to see...a
               distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase.  The man drops his
               case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.

               The Businessman looks out, ready to jump.  He doesn't see Ben
               (or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You think you got trouble?  Take a
                         good look, pal, how bad could it be?

               The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.  Ben steps forward.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, easy there, buddy.

               Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY!  His
               arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight
               while his legs thrash over speeding traffic.  Cars and trucks
               SKIM right underfoot.  Ben shakes his head.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You had to choose my spot, didn't you?

               Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam!  The
               Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP!  He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing
               hard on the highway!  A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben.  They point. 

               Ben looks up, deer in headlights.  He sees a massive TRUCK
               bearing down on the Businessman.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         This is really not my day.

               Ben DROPS to the street.  WHOOMPF!  He lands in front of the
               Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and
               turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.

               The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide.  The truck SWERVES,
               but cannot stop!  Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little
               scared.  He shuts his eyes, and...

               SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK!  A football move.  The
               truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to
               the windshield!  It looks like a metal car-compactor.

               The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders. 
               CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A
               FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT!  Windows shatter, fires flicker. 
               One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER.  COPS clamber out.

               EXT. CAB ON HIGHWAY - DAY

               Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back.  They see the action
               on the bridge.  Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the
               destruction.  He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped
               in his cab.  Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.

               He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the
               airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon.  He tries to grab
               the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG.  He struggles.

                                   BEN
                         A little help here?!  You wanna hit
                         that button, sir?

               The driver is too woozy.  Ben can't get to the button. 
               Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE
               DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab!  COPS round the corner. 
               They see Ben holding onto the Driver.  They raise their guns.

                                   COP
                         FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
                         DOWN!

               Ben looks at the cops.  PEDESTRIANS stare, point.  He
               realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man
               in hand.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - APPROACH - DAY

               At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops.  The
               whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  We PUSH
               TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...

               REED, JOHNNY, SUE.  They look through smoke and mayhem to
               see...their first full look at Ben.  Reed stands gutpunched.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not even Ben deserves that.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it.  He lunges
               behind a truck.  The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them
               back.  Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.

               He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on
               walkways overhead.  He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING
               MOTORISTS.  He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - GRIDLOCK - DAY

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames.  All other
               people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  BRIDGE POLICE herd
               the crowd away from the accident.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Back!  We're evac-ing the bridge. 

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny slow down, swap glances.

                                   SUE
                         What now?  Reed...?  What do we do?

               MOVE IN ON REED.  A first test of leadership.  But he is not
               a leader.  Not yet.  Sue gets closer to him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Ben's out there.  Let's go get him.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Maybe you didn't hear me.  Those cars
                         are gonna blow sky high, any second.

                                   REED
                         Look, we've got a friend out there in
                         trouble.  We need to get to him before --

                                   BRIDGE COP #2
                         Nobody gets past this point.

               A hard beat.  Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod.

                                   SUE
                         What?

                                   REED
                             (mutters)
                         We need to get past them.

               He motions to her body.  She understands.  She concentrates,
               and starts to turn invisible.

                                   BRIDGE COP #1
                         What the hell is this?  A magic show?

               But her clothes don't go invisible.  Beat.  Reed mutters:

                                   REED
                         Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.

                                   SUE
                         What...?
                             (realizes)
                         Oh.

               She unbuttons her blouse.  Not thrilled with the idea.  She
               wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She
               reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses
               concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her
               undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned. 

               The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of
               bricks.  Cops are transfixed.  So is Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         This is wrong in so many ways.

                                   REED
                         You've been working out.

                                   SUE
                         Shut up.

               Sue takes a deep breath.  Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing
               happens.  She's embarrassed and furious.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you
                         should strip down next, see how it
                         feels to have fifty people staring --

               ...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.  Undies float.  Jaws drop.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue?

               She stops ranting.  Realizes she's gone invisible.

                                   SUE (INVISIBLE)
                         Oh.  Well then...

               The undies drop.  The cops stare open-mouthed.  They turn to
               look at Reed, astonished.  He sheepishly shrugs his
               shoulders.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm gonna need serious therapy.

               A beat.  She walks away.  The cops watch her, gaping.  By the
               time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone,
               disappearing into the clouds of smoke.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best
               angle on the action.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY

               Reed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big
               TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!

               He finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO! 
               His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps.

                                   BEN
                         What the --!

                                   REED
                         Ben.  Are you okay?

                                   BEN
                         Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?! 

               He motions to Reed's neck.  Then to his own body:

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause
                         I sure ain't Ben anymore.

               Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT!

               Ben spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does
               see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!

               BOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty
               cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! 

               Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms
               FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.

               FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. 
               Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving
               him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,
               SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks
               the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.

               Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The
               air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.

               She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields
               SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames
               hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from
               her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... 

               Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE
               FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast
               deflects off the street and into...

               An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF
               THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail
               slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.

               THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE
               WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck
               TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the
               front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!

               He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across
               the concrete, digging grooves into the street.

               ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward
               the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down
               at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The
               HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!

               Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! 
               His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. 
               Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic,
               painful.

               He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. 
               His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the
               truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing
               over Ben.

               Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps
               back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary
               cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...

               The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers
               joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,
               touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. 

               Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;
               he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE.  Ben steps
               toward her, but she stops him with a look.  She places
               something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.

               Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground.  He stoops over
               to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING.  His big fingers can't grip
               it.  He tries in vain.  Hopeless, pathetic.  A beat.  And... 

               A hand grabs the ring.  It's Reed.  Quiet, close.

                                   REED
                         I swear to you, I will do everything
                         in my power until there is not a
                         breath left in me: you are going to be
                         Ben again.

               Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma TV. 
               ON THE TV: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new
               Fantastic Four.  For the first time they strike a heroic
               pose.  Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.

                                   LEONARD
                         Uh, sir...Larry King called, to
                         cancel.
                             (seeing the TV, a beat)
                         Apparently, there's a bigger story.

               Victor sees Reed put his arms around Sue as he covers her
               with the jacket. And the penny drops: he's FURIOUS.  As it
               hits him, he feels something odd.  He looks down at his
               hand...at glints of gleaming METAL poking through flesh.

               EXT./INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - DAY

               An impromptu command center -- a series of police tents,
               surrounded by EMERGENCY VEHICLES, NEWS VANS, FIRETRUCKS.

               INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - TENT - DAY

               Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny sit together, getting changed. 
               They get ready to go, but the CHIEF FIREMAN enters, stopping
               them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         There's some folks outside, want to
                         talk to you.

                                   REED
                         We're not going public with this. 
                         We're scientists, not celebrities.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         Too late, son.

               He turns on a little TV MONITOR in the corner.  NEWS FOOTAGE
               plays on all stations, with the tagline: FANTASTIC FOUR.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         That's what they're calling you.  The
                         Fantastic Four.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice.

               Johnny heads for the exit.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Let's think this
                         through, a second.

               Johnny pauses.  Rubs his chin once.  And...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay.  Done thinking.

               He runs out.  Sue, Ben, and Reed swap glances, knowing Johnny
               cannot be their spokesman.  They take off after him, out to --

               EXT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - PRESS FIELD - DAY

               CLICKCLICKCLICK!  Fifty cameras flash.  The field is full of
               press.  Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.

               Johnny eats up the attention.  Ben turns, self-conscious. 
               Reed notices.  The Chief Fireman turns to them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         So which one of you's the leader?

               Johnny does not hesitate.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That'd be me.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         No seriously.

               A beat.  Sue and Ben turn to Reed.  The Chief hands him a
               mic.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         You're on, son.  They all want a
                         statement.

               All eyes go on Reed.  He looks out, gulps hard.  A long beat.

                                   REED
                         Uh, during our recent mission to the
                         Von Doom space station, we were
                         exposed to as yet-unidentified
                         radioactive energy, most likely some
                         kind of nucleotide compoun--

               Nobody came for a science class.  A crush of questions
               overwhelms Reed:

                                   VARIOUS REPORTERS
                         What happened on the bridge?  Does it
                         hurt to stretch?  Were you really on
                         fire?  Is it true that one of you can
                         fly?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Working on it.  And it's a lot harder --

                                   SUE
                         We don't know much more than you do,
                         at this point.  Which is why we will
                         be going directly to the lab, where we
                         can diagnose our symptoms and --

                                   REPORTER #2
                         Symptoms?  So it's like a disease?

               Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt.  Ben is lost in
               thought, looking at Deb's ENGAGEMENT RING.  Johnny leaps in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Symptoms?  Please.  If having powers
                         is a disease, then yeah we got it. 
                         And we are gonna blow your minds. 
                         There's a new day dawning.  The day of
                         the Fantastic Four.

                                   REPORTER #3
                         That thing doesn't look too fantastic.

               The Reporter nods toward Ben.  Ben's fists tighten, the sound
               of rocks crushing together.  Reed feels the pain.

                                   REED
                         Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero
                         who's been through a terrible orde--

                                   JOHNNY
                         What he's trying to say is: every team
                         needs a mascot...

               Reporters laugh.  Ben turns his head away.  Reed burns.

                                   REED
                         Look, we went up to space to find a
                         way to understand DNA, to cure
                         disease, save lives.  Well, now it's
                         our DNA, our disease, our lives on the
                         line...
                             (a beat)
                         Thank you.  No more questions.

               Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.  The press waits a beat,
               then surges.  Ben spins, holding up one finger.  A giant.

                                   BEN
                         Be nice.

               The press step back, intimidated.  Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's
               FACE FREEZES.  It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in --

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               Establishing shot of a historic New York building.

               INT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               BANKERS sit around a table.  LAPTOPS hum.  The lead banker is
               power-broker NED CECIL.  The men keep their eyes on Victor.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Well, Victor, the bank would like to
                         congratulate you.  On the fastest
                         freefall since the Depression.  We
                         can't even give your stock away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ned, you know I can turn this around.

               Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You promised a cure-all, and came back
                         with this.  Who the hell's going to
                         invest in a biotech company that turns
                         its workers into circus freaks?

               Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS
               FLICKER, losing feeds.

               Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do
               that?)  He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.

                                   VICTOR
                             (pointed)
                         I really appreciate all your support.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You've got a week, Victor.  One week
                         to turn this around.  Or we pull
                         out...
                             (a beat)
                         This meeting is over.

               Victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we CUT HARD TO --

               INT. BANK - HALLWAY - DAY

               Victor and Leonard stride out.  Victor is writhing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know
                         preferred stock from livestock.

               Leonard is thinking all business.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir.  Reed's comments at that press
                         conference killed us.  How are we
                         going to turn this around?

               Victor considers.  His mind races, eyes narrow.

                                   VICTOR
                         Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can
                         cure these freaks, then I can cure
                         anyone.  What better way to restore my
                         reputation?

               Leonard nods, impressed.  Victor is a man in motion.  As they
               step into sunlight, we cut to...CLICKCLICKCLICK in --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               REPORTERS snap pictures.  A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping
               in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny and
               get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON,
               which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle
               position.

               COPS hold back the surging press.  Ben keeps his head down,
               self-conscious.  He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Smile, Ben.  They want to like you. 
                         Give 'em your good side.  Or your less
                         bad side.

               Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.  Stiff, tentative:

                                   BEN
                         Uh...don't do drugs.

               The kids FLINCH.  Ben trudges on.  Johnny smiles bright,
               doing hand-signs for F4.  Sue pulls him toward --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

               The Fantastic Four enter.  They are greeted by JIMMY
               O'HOOLIHAN, an old-time doorman with a kind smile.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr.
                         Richards.  All that for you?

               He motions to the flashing cameras outside.

                                   REED
                         I'm afraid so...

               He searches for the name.  Sue steps up.

                                   SUE
                         Jimmy.  Good to see you again.

               He smiles at Sue, then at Reed.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Good to see you too... Don't worry,
                         sir.  I know how crowded that head of
                         yours is.

                                   REED
                         Any visitors while I was away?

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Just the usual.  Told 'em you were
                         circling round outer space.

               He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK.  Reed looks
               sheepish.  He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue.

                                   REED
                         We had a tough year.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, nine years straight.

               Reed looks at Ben.  Thanks a lot.  DING.  Elevator doors
               open.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               They enter.  Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Twenty?  From outside the place looks
                         a lot taller.

                                   REED
                         Oh, it is.

               The doors close, but...the ELEVATOR does not move.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Either we're moving really fast...or
                         not at all.

               A digital readout on the panel: EXCEED MAXIMUM WEIGHT.  A
               sign reads: MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 2000 pounds.  They turn to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         I'll take the stairs.

               Doors open.  He lumbers out.  As the doors close behind him,
               he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The elevator rises.  Reed roils with guilt.

                                   SUE
                         How come Ben can't turn it on and off
                         like us?

                                   REED
                         That's what we're here to find out.

                                   SUE
                         If it happened to him, then it
                         could...

               Happen to all of them.  Reed nods softly.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Wait.  You mean there's chance we
                         could be full-on-24-7-fantastic? 

                                   SUE
                         Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run
                         around on fire for the rest of your
                         life?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I
                         can't be the only one who thinks
                         this is cool.

               Reed considers.  But Sue cuts him short with a look.

               DING!  The elevator stops.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

               The elevator opens.  They step out.  They might be on the
               20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor
               sixty.  It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above -- 

               Reed leads them into another area filled with separate
               "apartments" and all the amenities of home.

                                   REED
                         We should stay here until we can
                         define the extent of our changes...

                                   JOHNNY
                         This place is deluxe.  You got cable?

                                   REED
                             (hearing Ben's FOOTSTEPS)
                         ...and figure out how to reverse them. 
                         Let me show you to your rooms.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               The press has died down, but there are still plenty of
               cameras.  A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up.  Victor emerges, wearing
               sunglasses.  This time, the press pay no attention to him. 
               No cameras flash.  Victor tightens, and enters the building.

               INT. SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair. 
               She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a SCRAPBOOK.

               She flips through it.  It's filled with pictures of Reed and
               his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia
               globe.  She stops at a picture of her and Reed in COLLEGE.

               A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to
               see...VICTOR.  He smiles, standing at the door, watching her.

                                   VICTOR
                         God, I've been so worried about you.

               She notices the scar on his head.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, your scar --

                                   VICTOR
                         I told you, I'm fine.  It's you I'm
                         worried about.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --

                                   VICTOR
                         Please, no apologies.  I've arranged
                         for your things to be moved to one of
                         my condos.  You'll have round-the
                         clock care.

               He goes for her bag.  But she stops him.  A half beat.

                                   SUE
                         Thank you, that's generous, but I
                         think I should stay here.  With my
                         brother.  Until we get a handle on
                         this.

               Victor is not used to being rebuffed.  He gives a thin smile.

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue.  I think you should let my
                         doctors have a look at you.

               A tense beat.  Standoff.  Made more tense by --

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Victor!  What are you doing here?

               They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm starting to wonder the same
                         thing... How much do you know about
                         what happened to you?

                                   REED
                         Not much.  We need to run tests to see
                         the extent of the damage.

               Victor pauses.  He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, let me know if there is anything
                         I can do.  We're all in this together
                         now.

               Victor shakes Reed's hand.  His GRIP is so tight that Reed's
               fingers STRETCH.  Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts
               her hand out.  He smiles, and shakes.  He heads off.

               Reed looks at his hand.  Shakes his wrist.  He looks at
               Victor.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY

               Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  Reed catches
               up.

                                   REED
                         Victor wait... I just wanted to say,
                         I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
                         planned --

               Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR
                         Didn't go as planned?  It was a
                         catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of
                         four people --

                                   REED
                         I ruined?  With all due respect, I
                         told you to abort --

                                   VICTOR
                         Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my
                         name, billions of dollars on the line,
                         and I will not let you make me look
                         like a fool --

                                   REED
                         Victor, if we could understand what
                         happened to us --

                                   VICTOR
                         I don't want to understand it.  This
                         isn't one of your science projects.  I
                         just want to fix it.  Fast!

               Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing.  Lights dim.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         There a problem, Vic?

               They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway. 
               Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body.

                                   VICTOR
                         No problem, Ben.

               He turns back to Reed.  Close, quiet.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Just pay your goddamn electric bill,
                         and get to work on a cure.

               Victor steps away, toward the elevator.  He passes Ben, who
               just smiles and waves "goodbye."  Before Victor's finger taps
               the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit
               responded to him).  Reed exhales, shaken.  Victor steps into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE.  He SLAMS his
               fist into a STEEL WALL.  The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING.

               Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC
               SHELL under the skin.  He stares at it in horror.  The dark
               surface pulsates with electric energy.  What is he
               becoming...?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               Sue works the controls.  Reed approaches Ben with an
               ELECTRODE NEEDLE.  He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but
               it SNAPS.

                                   BEN
                         You got a chisel round here?

                                   REED
                         If we're going to identify the source
                         of the mutation, we need to isolate
                         your recombinant DNA so we can
                         activate positional genomes.

               Ben looks to Sue for translation.

                                   SUE
                         We need to give you a physical, so we
                         know what got zapped.

                                   BEN
                         Well why didn't you say so?  You want
                         me to lift some weights or something?

               Reed shakes his head.  He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE.

                                   REED
                         No, just sit back.  We have a good
                         sense of your strength from the
                         firetruck.  We need to find the source
                         of your strength.

               He turns on the X-ray machine.  The graph shows SOLID ROCK. 
               The rays don't penetrate.  Sue and Reed look confused.

                                   BEN
                         How bad is it?  You know I used to
                         smoke.

               Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too
               short to wrap around Ben's arm.  Reed stands stumped.  He
               looks at his tray full of instruments.  He picks up the
               little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER.  But it looks miniscule compared
               to Ben.

               Reed has an idea.  He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS. 
               He pulls of a real HAMMER.  He approaches Ben.

                                   REED
                         Okay, this might smart a little.

               He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS!  SLAMMING
               UP!  RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS!  The ultimate kick in the
               crotch.  Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK,
               wincing.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                             (high-pitched voice)
                         We'll...continue this later.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe
               Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  Flames escape
               through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!

               Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000
               degrees Kelvin.  They are essentially taking his temperature. 

               INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look
               at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  Machines go
               haywire.

               His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot
               or two.  He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.

                                   REED
                         Back it down, Johnny!

                                   JOHNNY
                         I can go hotter!

               He won't stop.  Reed pulls a switch on the wall.  FOAM sprays
               out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames.  He stands there,
               covered in thick FOAM.  His body steams.  So does his temper.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You're really cramping my style here.

                                   SUE
                         You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter,
                         you're approaching supernova --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Sweet.

                                   SUE
                         That's the temperature of the sun.

                                   REED
                         Not only could you kill yourself, but
                         you could set fire to Earth's
                         atmosphere and destroy all human life
                         as we know it.

                         Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.

               Reed looks at the control panels.

                         He cooked the equipment.

               Reed and Ben sit in chairs, facing each other.  A beat
               passes.  Ben taps his fingers on the chair, making small
               DENTS.  Reed looks down at his clipboard.  A little awkward.

                         from Sue.  That she thought might be
                         better coming from me... Can you, you

                         What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out
                         why we each ended up with different

               Reed and Sue, tables turned: Reed observes her through a
               prismatic device measuring light refraction.  He "sees" her
               through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature.  He's
               having a hard time concentrating.  He focuses on his work.

                                   REED
                         It's not "invisibility" per se. 
                         You're bending the light around you
                         with some kind of malleable force
                         field.  That's what you projected on
                         the Bridge.

                         What about you?  You haven't eaten in
                         days.  How come you're never on this
                         side of the microscope?

               He tightens, uncomfortable with being center of attention. 
               She reaches for his arm, like a specimen.  He pulls away, but
               she sees a glimpse of BRUISES on his ARMS.  She slows down.

                         Bruises...from the bridge?

               He nods, rolls down his sleeves.

                         Have you had any side-effects, from
                         your powers?

               She considers.  A little vulnerable.

                         I've had some headaches.  Migraines.

               A beat.  Reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.

                         You should be able to bend light

               She is annoyed.  Reed is oblivious.

                         I'm saying, if you had a little more

                         emotions when --

                                   SUE
                         Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

                                   REED
                         Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate
                         that feeling?  Some memory or...

                                   SUE
                             (staring right at him)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She looks at Reed, eyes narrow.  She becomes invisible.  As
               she focuses on Reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear FORCE
               FIELD forms around her body.  The force-field BENDS LIGHT
               around a MICROSCOPE, which goes INVISIBLE.  Reed steps out to
               ask...

                                   REED
                         How's that coming -- whoa --

               The FORCE-FIELD shoots in all directions, knocking everything
               over in a fifteen foot radius.  Reed is thrown from his
               chair.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
                         do that... You must think that was
                         some kind of latent hostility or --

                                   REED
                         What in the world would give me that
                         idea?

               An awkward beat.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I mean, you broke up with me, right?

                                   SUE
                         Are you kidding?

                                   REED
                         No, I distinctly remember: you walked
                         out my door.  Ergo...

               She didn't want to get into this.  She looks down,
               vulnerable.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  I was ready for the next step,
                         you weren't, ergo, I walked.

                                   REED
                         I think it was a little more
                         complicated than --

                                   SUE
                         I just wanted to share an apartment. 
                         What was so complicated about that?

               The question stumps him.  A beat.  He struggles.

                                   REED
                         There were a lot of variables to
                         consider --

                                   SUE
                         No.  There weren't.  There was you. 
                         And me.  No variables, no math.  It
                         was actually the simplest thing in the
                         world.  But your head got in the way...
                         like it always does.

               Her words penetrate.  He knows she's right.  He looks away.

                                   REED
                         Sue...I just...I thought...

               He struggles for the words.

                                   SUE
                         Same old Reed.  Too much thinking...

               He opens his mouth, but...WHAM!  Doors open.  Johnny enters,
               wearing a CHARRED SHIRT.  He points to the burned scraps of
               his shirt.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay guys, we have a serious problem.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from
               various closets/containers:

                                   REED (V.O.)
                         Our uniforms were exposed to the storm
                         like us.  So they can transform like
                         us, becoming invisible, changing size
                         on demand or remaining impervious to
                         flame.

               REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves
               in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  No boots, no gloves.  Not
               yet.  (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes).

                                   BEN
                         You look like an eighties rock band.

                             (to Ben)
                         The suit will stretch.  You should try
                         it --

                                   BEN
                         I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

                                   JOHNNY
                         He's right.  These costumes are...
                         missing something.  I can't put my
                         finger on it --

                                   REED
                         They're not costumes.

                                   SUE
                         We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we
                         need to stay here till we've stabilized.
                        
               Johnny shakes his head, frustrated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm getting sick of being trapped
                         here.  NASA wasn't even this strict!

               He marches out.  Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing.  Sue
               heads out, leaving Ben and Reed.  A beat.  Ben looks at Reed.

                                   BEN
                             (looking at uniform)
                         Maybe it's missing a utility belt. 

               Off Reed's dark look, we hear:

                                   VICTOR (V.O.)
                         So what's the prognosis?

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON: an X-RAY.  Victor's ARM.  The metallic
               transformation is higher now.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor
               and his DOCTOR.  In the wall behind them: ancient armor
               (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  It adds a little
               menace to the room.

                                   DOCTOR
                         Your tissue, your organs, your entire

                         Every system is still functioning,
                         somehow --

                         I don't really know.  A compound
                         organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than
                         titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than

                         At this rate, the infection should be
                         complete in two, maybe three weeks --

                         I wish I could tell you.  I can't
                         pretend to know what we're dealing
                         with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --

               Victor hardens, razor sharp.

                                   VICTOR
                         What?

                         The Center for Disease Control.  If
                         this thing is contagious --

               WHHM!  Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the
                         face of a billion-dollar-company... We
                         need to keep this confidential,
                         understand?

               Victor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat.

                                   DOCTOR
                         But...this disease...is progressive...
                         degenerative...

                                   VICTOR
                         That's terrible news...

               With one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm
               into the doctor, killing him instantly.  Victor retracts his
               arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter
               Building, spending hours searching for the cure.  He checks
               charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.

               Finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where
               Ben's CHARTS are projected (both Ben and Thing's anatomies). 
               Reed wears the uniform under his labcoat.  He checks his
               equations over and over, making notes upon notes.

                                   REED
                         Nothing...nothing...nothing...

               He hits the end of the slides.  The wall fills with white
               light.  Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH! 
               Something FALLS off the end of the desk.

               Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face.  He steps
               over to see...a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered. 
               Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Of course...of course...the cloud...

               THE COSMIC STORM swirls, terrifying.  We slowly PULL BACK TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MAIN LAB - NIGHT

               The STORM is a computer-image on screen now.  Behind the
               screen are six chalkboards full of Reed's calculations and
               the scribbled beginnings of a MACHINE.

               We PULL BACK to see his arm stretched across the room writing
               on the end of another chalkboard.

               He's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic.  He
               hears...a CREAK.  He slows down, but doesn't look up to see
               SUE enter.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing?

                         The plants, from space.  Their
                         particles are still charged.  With the
                         right amount of energy, those ions
                         could create the elemental profile of
                         the cosmic storm.

               He rifles through a desk drawer, then heads out.  Sue stands
               there, looking at the storm.  Concerned.  Then we CUT TO --

                         If we can build a machine to re-create
                         the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

               He keeps his head down, making notes, entering --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - STOREROOM - NIGHT

               Reed and Sue enter.  Reed is looking for something.  Sue
               slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam-packed with
               GEAR, GADGETS, BLUEPRINTS, INVENTIONS.  Awe-inspiring,
               overflowing.

                                   SUE
                         You really need to get a janitor.

               She stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.

                         This must be what it looks like inside
                         your head.

               Reed finds his electron microscope.  He turns to Sue,

                         Wait!  Sue, don't touch tha--

               The little car sets the whole shelf off balance.  A WAVE OF
               INVENTIONS COME CLATTERING DOWN!  Reed moves fast:

               He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF,
               pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND! 

               Reed and Sue hit the floor.  A close call.  Now more
               closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped
               around her.  A heated beat.  Their first real intimate
               moment.

                                   SUE
                         Sorry.  My fault.  I won't...touch
                         anything.

               As if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, Sue and
               Reed stand, backing off.  As they part, we see:

               BEN watching from the doorway.  Melancholy.  He disappears. 
               We slowly MOVE TO...A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in a VENT GRATE.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches a bank of videoscreens.  He has the Baxter
               Building under surveillance.  He sees Reed and Sue on
               monitors.  He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved
               hand.

               A door opens.  Leonard enters.  He sees the screens.

                                   LEONARD
                         Is Reed any closer to a cure?

               Victor looks at that image of Reed and Sue on the screen.

                                   VICTOR
                         The only thing he's closer to is
                         Sue...

               But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall. 
               He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to
               his will.  He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:

               REED'S BLUEPRINTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER.  Victor's
               eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Make me a reservation for two at
                         Cipriani tonight.

               Victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         And get this over to Ben Grimm.

               Victor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  As he gets
               closer, his screens go STATICKY.  He absentmindedly picks at
               his SCAR.  In shadows, we see skin peeling off.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em
                         closed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT

               BEN GRIMM stands front and center.  Not the Thing.  But BEN
               GRIMM.  A normal man.  He smiles wide, shaking his head.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         You surprised?

               Now we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The
               Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old
               life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the
                         fire department didn't shut this down.

               ON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a
               SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy. 
               On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together.

                                   THE THING
                         God.  I was good looking.

               We hear the party sing "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."  Debbie kisses Ben. 
               Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out
               candles.

                                   DEBBIE (ON SCREEN)
                         What did you wish for, honey?

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         I already got it.  Everything I want.

               As they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.  The tape ends,
               and he sits in darkness for a beat.  A long, lonely beat.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLS - NIGHT

               Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. 
               As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:

               REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is
               STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just
               shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM... 

               UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The
               muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach... 

               REED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in
               his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES. 
               His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his
               skin.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Damn, Stretch!

               Reed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall.

                                   JOHNNY
                         How far's that rubber bend?

               Reed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring.

                                   REED
                         That's what I'm trying to calculate. 
                         And it's not rubber.  It's muscle,
                         tendon.  I seem to have the ability to
                         manipulate the malleability of my
                         molecular structure and redistribute
                         my density to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Right, whatever, have fun.

               And Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP.  It starts
               to POP in his hand, the bag swelling.  He casually turns on a
               TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES.  The Jiffy Pop swells, ready
               to blow.  He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the
               games:

               Cool stunts, hot girls.  Johnny's brow furrows, a thought
               forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT

               A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora. 
               Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Dark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A
               shadow emerges.  Ben.  He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a
               classic Brooklyn tavern.  Neon sign.  Music, life inside. 
               Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes
               through the door into --

               INT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT

               A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a
               place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He
               moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way.

               Ben reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH! 
               The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard. 
               Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.

                                   BEN
                         That's not funny!

               They go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out,
               scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar.

                                   ERNIE
                         Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first
                         mook from Brooklyn to go to outer
                         space, so pay him some respect!

               But the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary.

                                   BEN
                         Ernie.  Sorry for killing your
                         business.  I'll take the usual, then
                         I'm out... Better make it a double.

               Ernie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his
               head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the
               bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA
               MASTERS.

                                   ALICIA
                         Who killed the party?

               She turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack
               of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind.

                                   ERNIE (O.S.)
                         Make it a triple.  On the house,
                         Benny.

               Ben takes his drink, but SMASH!  His grip shatters the glass,
               spilling all over himself.  He smiles ruefully.

                                   BEN
                         If there's a God, she hates me.

               He grabs a bar-rag to dry off.

                                   ALICIA
                         I don't think She's real big on hate.

                                   BEN
                         You wouldn't say that, if you could
                         see me.

               She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.

                                   ALICIA
                         Can I...?  See you...?

               Ben doesn't say anything.  A little unnerved by this woman.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         It's okay, I won't bite...
                             (feeling his arm)
                         ...not that I could.

               She puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and
               gentle touch allows Ben to let her.  She smiles softly.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         Such a sad face... You know, sometimes
                         being different isn't a bad thing.

                                   BEN
                         Trust me, this ain't one of those
                         times.

               She smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.

                                   ALICIA
                         See you round, Benny...

               Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         I'm Alicia, by the way.

               Ben watches her disappear.  He sees a few people staring.  He
               lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new
               drink, in a steel MARTINI SHAKER.  He knocks it back.

               EXT./INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Lights twinkle.  A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs. 
               Heads turn, whispers flutter.  SUE steps out, joining...
               Victor at a prime table.  He pulls out her chair, wearing
               gloves.

                                   VICTOR
                         Thank you for coming out to see me.

               She nods, a little self-conscious.

                                   SUE
                         You said it was urgent.

                                   VICTOR
                         It is.  There's something we need to
                         talk about.  Something I need to ask
                         you...

               Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.

                                   SUE
                             (slow, careful)
                         Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I
                         want you to know I appreciate
                         everything you've done for me, but I
                         just don't --

                                   VICTOR
                         Susan.  What are you doing?

               He is cold as ice.  If he's hurt, he'll never show it.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         You think I brought you here to talk
                         about us?  Please.  This is business.
                             (leaning forward, intense)
                         I need to know: how close is Reed
                         to finding to a cure?

               She pauses.  Then:

                                   SUE
                         He's working round the clock.  But the
                         data needs to be tested, analyzed
                         before --

                                   VICTOR
                         Same old Reed.  All analysis, no
                         action.  Wasn't that the problem with
                         you two?

               She holds tight, keeping cool.

                                   SUE
                         If these molecules aren't stable, they
                         could make us worse, maybe even kill
                         us.

                                   VICTOR
                         Then why is Reed dragging his feet? 
                         Maybe he likes having his prize
                         specimen under glass...
                             (closer, cruel)
                         It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally
                         the perfect woman for him...because
                         you're his science project.

               The words sting.  She can't help but hear some truth in them.

                                   SUE
                         Please don't make this personal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Oh, I think you already have.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, we can't do anything until the
                         research is ready.

               Victor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX.

                                   VICTOR
                         "We," huh?

               Victor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard
               that he SPILLS water.  Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.  Victor
               gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Don't forget who you work for, Susan. 
                         So get to work.  And do your job.

               He walks out.  As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out
               of his pocket.  He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the
               dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.

               Sue sits embarrassed.  She slowly...disappears.  People gasp. 
               She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT
               through the air.  At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN --

                                   BUSINESSMAN
                         I wish my wife would disappear.

               The other men laugh, but WHHM!  The man's wine SPILLS into
               his LAP!  Sue walks out.  The restaurant is left buzzing. 
               Lights twinkle.  And we FADE OUT.  A beat.  Then we CRASH
               INTO --

               EXT. NYC ARENA - ESPN MOTO X GAMES - DAY

               The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills
               and ramps...where MOTO-BIKES launch into the air to the
               delight of 20,000 fans.  The Riders spin and flip, performing
               aerial acrobatics on their 250CC motor bikes.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
                         a special guest for you... Johnny
                         Storm of the Fantastic Four!

               JOHNNY emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the
               crowd.  He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep.  He
               beelines to RONNIE RENNER.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan.

               Ronnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by
               this circus freak.

               The other bikers approach.

                                   KENNY BARTRAM
                         Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take
                         her for a spin?

               He motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine.

                                   RONNIE RENNER
                         Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some
                         tricks...if you can keep up.

               We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO --

               INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY

               Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. 
               Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with
               the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. 
               Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER
                         A rock-solid double-flip!

               The CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the
               hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Look at that lift, ladies and
                         gentlemen!

               Johnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie
               tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump,
               and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and
                         whipped!

               He lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS
               his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning. 
               He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A
                         720?

               Johnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the
               last hill.  He leans over his handlebars.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         He's going for a Kiss of Death!

               Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING
               STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And...
               
               JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to
               streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! 
               LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A
               FLAMING BLUR!

               And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts
               to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling
               upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                             (hand over mic)
                         Is he......flying?

               A beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down! 
               LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing,
               maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny
               swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face.  What
               the hell just happened??

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         You've just seen the first...the
                         first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH!

               A new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing
               ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike:

               THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY
                         My bad.  Sorry about that.
                             (a glance to Ronnie)
                         Thanks for the lesson, bro.

               HOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a
               scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING

               Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses
               on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to
               disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as
               well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet:

                                   SUE
                         That's new...

               Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down,
               preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Have you read these...?  From all
                         over.  People want us to fight crimes... 
                         save their kids...solve their problems...
                             (no response from Reed)
                         ...when we can't even solve our
                         own.

               She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Reed.  How close are we to a cure?

                                   REED
                         No way to know.  Without more
                         tests, experiments.

               She considers.  Victor's words echo in her head.

                                   SUE
                         We're not specimens, we're patients. 
                         This isn't just another science
                         project to you, is it...?

               Reed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!!

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY

               CRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and
               Sue rush in.

                                   REED
                         BEN!  What?  What's going on!?

               Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES.

                                   X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what can you tell us about the
                         outfit?

               REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is
               peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit,
               revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST.

               Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge
               18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Not too much, but I will say that it's
                         all weather and no leather.  Kind of
                         Armani meets Astronaut.

               Ben, Sue, and Reed stare at the wall-sized TV.  Mouths agape.

                                   SUE
                         He didn't.

                                   BEN
                         Oh, he did.

                                   SUE
                         What did he do to the uniform?!

               She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back
               his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.

                                   REED
                         He talked me into it.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what are your superhero names?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies
                         call me Torch.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about the rest of the team?

               Johnny hadn't really thought about them.  He spitballs:

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Uh, we call my sister the invisible
                         girl...the Invisible Girl.

                                   SUE
                         Girl...?!

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         That's easy to remember.  And Reed
                         Richards?  He's the leader.  So
                         what's he?  Mr. Fantastic?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader.

               Reed shrugs.  He doesn't hate the name.

                                   BEN
                         Could be worse.

               Case in point: a photo of Ben fills the TV.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about this one?  What do you call
                         this Thing?

               Johnny smiles, looking right into camera.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would
                         have gone with The Rock, but it was
                         taken.  And "Thing" pretty much sums
                         it up.

               A LAUGH from the studio audience.

                                   BEN
                             (matter-of-fact)
                         Okay.  I'm gonna go kill him now.

               He turns to go.  Reed wraps an arm around Ben.

                                   REED
                         Ben!  Slow down a second and --

               He sees a photo of himself on screen.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         Is it true what they say?  That he can
                         expand any part of his anatomy?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Actually, between us, I think he's got
                         some problems staying rigid.

                                   REED
                             (finishing his thought to Ben)
                         ...wait for me...

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         Which may explain why this woman's
                         not smiling.

               They put up a shot of Susan.

                                   SUE
                         I'm driving.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Dude.  That's my sister.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - DAY

               The Thing rounds the corner.  Sees a crowd of girls lined up
               near a red PORSCHE parked out front...with "TORCHED" on the
               plates.  Ben slows down, smiles.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - A LITTLE LATER

               Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in
               the line.  Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents. 

               Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (looking around)
                         Where's my ride?

               The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED
               JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in
               front of Johnny.  The Valet timidly holds out the keys...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         What the?!  Is that my --

               Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the
               license plate.  It rattles to the ground, face up.

               Johnny rubs the sting out of his head.  Looks up and sees Ben
               in the distance, dusting off his hands.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (shouting: to Ben)
                         You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
                             (seeing Sue)
                         What?!

                                   SUE
                         You gave us names?  What are you, the
                         "face" of the Fantastic Four now?

               Ben marches up.  Hands balled into fists.

                                   BEN
                         It's about to be a broken face.

                                   REED
                         This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need
                         to be careful until we're normal
                         again.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What if some of us don't want to be
                         "normal" again?  We didn't all turn
                         into monsters like --

               Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.  Stops himself. 
               Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.

               Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the
               head.  Ben stops.  Turns around more shocked than hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Did you just --

               Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.  This time in the face.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want
                         to fly?  Fly.

               Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps
               in the way!  Too late!  WHAMM!  Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO
               REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's
               fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet. 

               BAM!  Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a
               BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.  WHOOSH!  He
               leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.

               The crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop. 

               Johnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck
               begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he
               stands.  Heating up.  Both his hands are now flaming fists of
               fury.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see if we can get blood from a
                         stone.

               He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them. 
               High Noon.  They start to RUN toward each other...

               When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM,
               stops them both in their tracks with just a look.  Like a
               mom:

                                   SUE
                         You two need a time-out.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Blockhead started it!

               Ben just stalks off.  The crowd clears, scared.  A PAPARAZZI
               snaps a picture.  Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens.

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         Damn it, Johnny.

               She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk.

                                   REED
                         You need to control yourself and think
                         before you --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if
                         we got these gifts for a reason?  What
                         if we have some, you know...like,
                         calling?

                                   REED
                         A higher calling like getting girls
                         and making money?

               Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is there any higher?

               Reed looks at him, disgusted.  Johnny waves to the crowd,
               hand flaming.  People SHRIEK, snap pictures.  Johnny smiles at
               Reed.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This is who we are Reed.  Accept it. 
                         Or better yet: enjoy it.

               Johnny steps into the sea of fans.  Reed stands alone.

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY

               Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.  Tries to catch
               up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Slow down...

               Ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  She catches up.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. 
                         He's always been a hothead --

                                   BEN
                         It's not him.  It's them.
                             (pointing to crowd)
                         I can't live like this.

                                   SUE
                         Just give Reed a little more time.
                         You know how he works -- analyzing
                         every little step before he takes
                         one --

                                   BEN
                         It's easy for you to be patient.

                                   SUE
                         No, it's not.  I thought I was done
                         waiting for Reed... We're all in this
                         together now, Ben.

               He slows down, gets closer, intense.

                                   BEN
                         Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got
                         no idea what I'd give...to be
                         invisible.  Your nightmare...is my
                         dream.

               She opens her mouth, but has no response.  She doesn't know
               his depth of pain.  As he disappears into the alley, we CUT
               TO --

               INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               The news plays on the TV.  Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the
               screen on an image of...THE THING.  He turns to Victor, who
               sits with the rest of the bankers.  Cold, sterile
               environment.

                                   NED CECIL
                         This is how you "turn things around"? 
                         These freaks are on the front page and
                         your company's in the obituaries.

               Victor has a larger bandage on his face now.

                                   VICTOR
                         I have a plan to use their publicity
                         for --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough
                         already.  This isn't a negotiation. 
                         It's a notification.  We're pulling
                         out.

               A cold, silent beat.  Victor leans forward.

                                   VICTOR
                         You need to look long-term here. 
                         Without risk, there's no --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Reward.  We all know the sales
                         pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're
                         done buying... Gentlemen.

               He motions to his men.  They all stand.  Victor is the lone
               man sitting.  PUSH IN on Victor's face, his inner rage
               palpable.  A few quick surges of electricity emanate from his
               body.  This man is getting stronger, more electric.

               INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY

               After hours.  The floor is slick with water -- puddles in
               every direction.  Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator,
               heading for his car.  As he goes, the structure lights start
               to flicker.  Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by
               one, furthest to closest.  He looks around.  Unnerved by the
               darkness.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Hello...?

               A hanging beat.  Victor steps out from shadows.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                             (relieved, almost)
                         Von Doom?  Gave me a little shock.  No
                         hard feelings, right?  Nothing
                         personal.

               Victor says nothing.  Ned keeps going.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         You know, you could always move back
                         to Latvura, start fresh.

               He mispronounces Latveria, dripping condescension.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         Maybe that's where you belong, back in
                         the "old country."

               That does it.  A surge of electricity courses through Victor. 
               His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to
               THE GROUND.  The electric spark hits the water and...

               ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING
               LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric
               snakes), heading straight for Ned.  His eyes go wide.  And...
              
               NED IS ELECTROCUTED!  His body spasms.  THUD!  He slumps,
               dead.  Smoke rises from his body.  Victor stands, power
               swelling.

               For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL
               GLOW beneath the skin.  He remains scary calm.

                                   VICTOR
                         It's pronounced Latveria.
                             (looking down at the dead body)
                         This meeting's over, Ned.

               Victor walks away, the final lights going to DARKNESS.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor enters, still adrenalized.  He turns to the light
               switch, and the lights come on.  He approaches his screens,
               and the monitors flicker to life.  His powers are growing. 

               One MONITOR rolls the news.  IMAGES of the FANTASTIC FOUR. 
               Victor leans closer, and the VOLUME automatically goes up.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                         ...the Fantastic Four put on quite a
                         show last night.  They landed in every
                         major headline in the northern
                         hemisphere.  In related news...

               An IMAGE of VICTOR on screen.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                         Reports have surfaced that Von Doom
                         Industries may be filing for
                         bankruptcy.  You may remember that it
                         was Victor Von Doom who...

               Victor turns away from the screen.  The volume goes down.  He
               focuses his eyes on REED.

               Leonard enters, stepping closer, seeing the faint flicker of
               VICTOR'S METALLIC SCAR.  His eyes narrow, concerned.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, is everything okay?  What
                         happened to your...?

               Victor keeps his eyes on the screen, totally engrossed.

                                   VICTOR
                             (under breath, seething)
                         Reed... He got what he wanted...
                             (looking at Sue)
                         Everything he wanted...he took from me.

               He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed. 
               A hard, deadly beat.  Victor's eyes narrow, zooming
               into...REED'S RESEARCH: SLIDES on the wall.  He zooms into
               key words:

               DANGER, UNSTABLE IONS, MUTATION, OVERLOAD.  And Victor gives
               a slow, thin smile.  A new plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Now I'm going to take it back.  Piece
                         by bloody piece...

               His fist clenches.  We hear METALLIC SFX.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal
               man could balance.  But he is not normal.  His arms are
               wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine. 
               He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...

               VICTOR overseeing a group of TECHNICIANS.  They are boxing up
               Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research.  Victor wears
               a bandage, covering his scar.  Reed eyes a glint of METAL.

                                   REED
                         Victor, are you...are you okay? 

               Victor turns away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Don't worry about me.  Worry about
                         yourself.

               Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.

                                   REED
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         What I should have done a long time
                         ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. 
                         This all belongs to me.

               Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.

                                   REED
                         But I'm not done with the machine --

                                   VICTOR
                         Which is precisely the point.
                         Analysis is over.  It's time for
                         action.  My men could have mass-
                         produced this by now.

               Reed shakes his head, defending himself.

                                   REED
                         Mass-produced?  This isn't a
                         toaster.  You have no idea how it
                         works.

               Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the
               intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE.  He points to parts:

                                   VICTOR
                         Re-create the storm, invert the
                         polarity here, reverse the mutation
                         there.  Don't talk to me like I'm some
                         schoolboy.  I've got the same Phd you
                         do.

               Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with
               his machine.  He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.

                                   REED
                         The storm needs to be handled exactly
                         right, or it could make our mutations
                         worse, much worse, maybe even kill
                         us...

               Victor slows.  Is Reed getting to him?  Or giving him ideas?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Victor, please.  We need time to
                         verify the data... We can't afford any
                         mistakes -- there's only enough ions
                         for two or three attempts.

               Victor considers.  He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed.  I'm not asking permission.
                             (a final verdict)
                         We'll build it, while you check the
                         specs.

               Victor walks out.  Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               The SHIELDS slowly rise.  FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work.  They
               wear the VDI jackets.  Reed watches, worried.

               Sue enters.  She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI
               logo.  And she is deeply worried.  She steps over to Reed. 
               Sparks fly behind them.  Drills scream.

                                   SUE
                         Can I talk to you?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed.  Quiet, urgent:

                                   SUE
                         Don't let Victor push you into making
                         a mistake --

                                   REED
                         He was going to take away all my data,
                         equipment --

                                   SUE
                         Better than your life.  Victor's not
                         the one who has to get into that
                         thing.  We are.

               Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.

                                   REED
                         Which is why I'm working twenty hours
                         a day, checking every variable --

                                   SUE
                         Every variable but yourself.  You
                         don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in
                         your head like --

                                   REED
                             (finally losing it)
                         I'm not the only one in there.  I got
                         you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling
                         around in there.

               Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  A beat.

                                   SUE
                         So clear it out.  Get out of your
                         head.  Get out of here...

               He looks at her, knowing what she means.  Where she means.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,
               mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE
               GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.

                                   LITTLE GIRL
                         Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My
                         kitty is stuck in a tree.

               She gestures to a tree next to Ben.  Looks up.

                                   LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                         Please save Miss Lucy.

               Ben rolls his eyes.  Looks up.  Considers climbing the tree,
               but thinks better of it.  He has another idea...

               Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap
               out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!

               The cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks
               out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands
               the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. 
               He just moves on.

               EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE
               SCULPTURE of his bust.

               He stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely
               rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the
               haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched,
               but...

                                   BEN
                             (under breath)
                         Eyebrows are a little big...

               A beat.  He stares at these images of himself.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I figured the only way to get you here
                         was to stick that in the window.

               He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.

                                   BEN
                         How'd you know it was me?

                                   ALICIA
                         I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?

               He steps toward her.  But he sees...a PARTY in the back part
               of the gallery.  Ben pauses, a little insecure.

                                   BEN
                         I'm not really dressed for a party.

                                   ALICIA
                         Relax, it's casual.

                                   BEN
                         No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty... 

               She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --

               INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT

               WHOOSH!  A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at
               BEN.  Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING
               CHISELS for his cracks.  Intricate, intimate work.

               Ben enjoys every moment.  He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in
               the corner.

                                   BEN
                         Those yours too?

                                   ALICIA
                         My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into
                         stone.  I was wondering when you'd
                         walk by.

                                   THE THING
                         You know, you could'a run an ad in the
                         personals.

                                   ALICIA
                         "Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
                         rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual
                         relationship."

                                   THE THING
                         This ain't permanent.  My friend
                         Reed's working on a cure...I think.

               She gets closer, running her hands across his arm.

                                   ALICIA
                         Bennie.  You feel pretty good as is.

               Ben bristles.  He doesn't want to stay this way.

                                   THE THING
                         You don't know what it's like out
                         there.  Walking around like some kind
                         of circus freak.  People staring,
                         whispering --

                                   ALICIA
                         I wouldn't know anything about that.

                                   THE THING
                         I mean...

                                   ALICIA
                         Tell me.  When you grew up in
                         Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you
                         know?
                             (a beat)
                         You went your own way then.  You
                         didn't listen to people.  So why start
                         now...?

               As he ponders that, we hear a CROWD SWELLING on the CUT TO --

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Fans swarm JOHNNY.  He signs autographs, poses for pictures. 
               Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO.  A
               tinted window rolls down.  Victor's face emerges.

                                   VICTOR
                         Need a ride, Johnny?

               EXT./INT. LIMO - NIGHT

               Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.

                                   VICTOR
                         A few fans.  Hope you don't mind.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Gotta take care of the fans, right? 

               He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, I built my business knowing what
                         people want.  And right now, the
                         people want you.

               Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.

                                   JOHNNY
                         And we don't want to let the people
                         down now, do we?

                                   VICTOR

                         No we don't.  Which is why we need
                         to strike while the iron's hot. 
                         I'm talking action figures,
                         videogames, sponsors --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Videogames?  You serious?

               Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You talk to Reed and Sue about this?

                                   VICTOR
                         Johnny.  Let's be honest here.  Ben,
                         Reed, Sue.  Good people, all.  But
                         stars?
                             (shaking his head, a beat)
                         I don't want to break up the band, but
                         you're the one they want.  Don't you
                         think it's time to go solo...?

               Victor subtly nods to the models.  They envelop Johnny.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Take the car for a spin.  Think about
                         it.  Is this the life you want?  Or
                         would you rather live in Reed's
                         lab...?

               The car stops.  Victor gets out.  He stands on the pavement. 
               As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny. 
               The door shuts, and...

               WHHHMMMPF!  The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!

               INT. HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

               STARS on the ceiling.  A VOICE drones about the galaxy.  In
               the LAST ROW, we find: Reed and Sue.  Reed is thinking about
               work.

                                   REED
                         I could get Ben to tap into the
                         Baxter's main power to generate enough
                         voltage --

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look
                         up.

               He slowly looks up.  The stars seem to calm him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Remember our first date here...?  God,
                         I was so nervous.

                                   REED
                         You were?

                                   SUE
                         Of course I was.  I'd read all your
                         papers on bioethics.  Some of them two
                         times just so I'd have something to
                         say to you.

               Reed smiles softly, thinking back.

                                   REED
                         You know, I bribed the projectionist
                         ten bucks to keep it open late?

                                   SUE
                         I gave him twenty.

               They laugh.  Sue looks up to the stars.  Quiet:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         I didn't want that night to end.

               Reed looks at her.  Wrestles with a decision.  Then quietly:

                                   REED
                         Sue, you were right.  It wasn't
                         complicated.  I just wasn't ready to
                         be...to become...
                             (a beat)
                         You can be a little intimidating. 

               She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         You always talked about how you liked
                         the kind of man who could approach
                         you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't
                         afraid to tell you what he wanted.

                                   SUE
                         I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted
                         you to be that man.

               Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         When I walked out, I waited ten
                         minutes outside your door.  Ten. 
                         Waiting for you to come find me.

                                   REED
                         Why didn't you say something?

                                   SUE
                         That would have kinda defeated the
                         purpose.  And Reed...
                             (closer, emotional)
                         I'm saying it now.

               Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their
               faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue
               disappears.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                             (quiet, playful)
                         Come find me.

               Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...

                                   SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft,
               tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT

               Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. 
               A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips
               her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal.

                                   ALICIA
                         Look around.  I'll get us drinks. 
                         They always let blind girls cut the
                         line.

               She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. 
               The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is
               the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling
               hard.

               Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained
               smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. 
               He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.
               
               Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him,
               thinking he's just an inanimate statue.

                                   PATRON
                         I don't know about this one.  It lacks
                         a certain...realism.

               Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN
               GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         She's always had a thing for runaways
                         and strays, but this is ridiculous.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #2
                         I know.  Did she really think these
                         sculptures would sell?

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         Like anybody would want this thing in
                         their house.  That girl's a one-woman
                         charity.

               Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the
               room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He
               glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten
               seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. 

               We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging
               where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for
               him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his
               heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. 

               THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --

               EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT

               A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN
               sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. 
               Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a
               metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then...

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         This seat taken?

               Ben turns to see...VICTOR.

                                   BEN
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm worried about you.

                                   BEN
                         About me?  How sweet.

                                   VICTOR
                         Come on.  Let me buy you something to
                         eat.  Looks like you could use the
                         company.

               Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat.

               INT. DINER - LATER

               Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a
               foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge
               plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other
               customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles
               the plates.

                                   THE THING
                         'Scuse me.

                                   VICTOR
                         I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't
                         changed that much for Reed, Sue and
                         Johnny.  At least they can go out in
                         public.  But for you?  People staring.
                         Whispering behind your back...

                                   THE THING
                         If you're trying to cheer me up you're
                         doing a helluva job --

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm just saying, I know what it's like
                         to lose something you love.  To see it
                         slip away, and know it's never coming
                         back.

               The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.

                                   THE THING
                         Reed's gonna fix me up --

                                   VICTOR
                         For your sake I hope you're right. 
                         I'm sorry if that sounds a little
                         skeptical.

                                   THE THING
                         Skeptical...?

               Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure
               points.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, he's a brilliant man, we should
                         trust he's working as hard as he can. 
                         You're his best friend.  So what
                         possible reason could he have for
                         taking his time?
                             (a beat)
                         I mean, other than getting close to
                         Sue?

               Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't
               help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  Reed
               turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN.  He
               sits waiting, scowling.  They stop laughing immediately.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, I have that effect on people.

               The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete. 
               The Technicians are gone now.

                                   REED
                         Ben --

                                   BEN
                         Oh, you remember my name do you?  You
                         happen to remember what you swore to
                         do with every breath in your body?

                                   REED
                         We're working as hard as we can --

                                   BEN
                         Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.

               He motions to Reed and Sue together.

                                   REED
                         Come on, this is nothing.

               Sue looks a little hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Glad "nothing" could take you away
                         from your work.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I don't know if this thing'll
                         change us back or make us worse. 
                         I need you to be patient for a little
                         while longe--

               He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around
               it like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  Ben pushes Reed back.  Hard.

                                   BEN
                         Look at me, Reed.  Look at me!

               He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin.  He
               THROWS Reed back.  Reed slams down to the ground.

                                   REED
                         I am looking.  That's why I can't make
                         a mistake!  I've got to get it right,
                         and it's not right yet!  We need to
                         test this.

               Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed.

                                   BEN
                         I spent my whole life protecting you,
                         from the schoolyard to the stars.  For
                         what?  So you could play Twister with
                         your girlfriend while I'm the freak of
                         the week?

               Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back.  Reed slams
               into the wall, and stays down this time.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it.

               She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields.

                                   BEN
                         Stay out of this Susie.

               As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben
               up like a python.  They struggle.  Ben runs back into a wall
               to shake Reed.  Their faces are close, heated.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Good thing you're flexible enough to
                         watch your own back.  'Cause you're on
                         your own now.

               Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go.  Ben walks out.  Sue
               comes to Reed's side.  He's bleeding.

                                   REED
                         I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop
                         him.

               She heads out.  Reed slowly stands.  He looks at the
               transformation machine.  It's not ready.  But...Reed steps
               toward it.  As he walks, his image goes grainy in --

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every
               step.  This is what Victor has been waiting for.  His screens
               flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull
               back.  He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE.  Hits a countdown. 
               And he grabs his UNIFORM...

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sue hustles down the long hall.  Ben turns a corner, passing
               the elevators, heading toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She gets
               there too late.  Doors close, going down.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Ben pounds across the lobby.  He sees Johnny coming in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Christmas come early!  Check it out!

               He holds up an ACTION FIGURE of BEN: a horribly bloated body
               topped by a tiny pinhead.  Johnny pushes a button and --

                                   BEN ACTION FIGURE
                         IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!

               WITH ONE ARM, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall.  With his other
               hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches
               from Johnny's head.  The toy lodges into the plaster.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey!  That's a prototype!

                                   BEN
                         Go back to the drawing board.

               He strides away.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               DING.  Sue speeds out of the elevator.  No sign of Ben.  She
               runs into...JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny?  Did you see Ben?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm
                         done with this freak show.  I'm moving
                         back to the real world.

                                   SUE
                         Is that what you call it?  "Real"?

                                   JOHNNY
                         At least it beats living in a lab like
                         somebody's science project.

               This hits home.  Sue is quiet.  Johnny turns to go.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know
                         mom didn't raise us to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Look around, sis!  She's not here.  So
                         you can stop talking to me like I'm
                         your little boy --

                                   SUE
                         As soon as you stop acting like one. 
                         Come on, you're smarter than this. 
                         You think those people out there care
                         about you?  You're just a fad to them.

               He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's try something new: you live
                         your life.  And I'll live mine.
                             (beat)
                         And just for the record: they LOVE
                         me.

               He strides into the night, leaving Sue alone.  A dark night. 
               The Fantastic Four is no more.  The family is split apart.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               The transformation chamber is up and running.  Numbers count
               down.  The storm swirls in the chamber.  Reed now wears the
               UNIFORM.  He opens the door:

               HE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF.  HE IS FINALLY TAKING
               ACTION.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor sits enthralled.  He leans forward, breathless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed gets closer.  His heart races.  So does Victor's.  A
               moment of truth for both of them.  REED STEPS INTO THE
               MACHINE.

               Reed looks up at the cosmic storm.  He opens his arms, ready
               to risk his life.  And...WHHHM!  He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION,
               RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO --

               VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               His screens GO BLACK.  He looks out the window to see...a
               flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING.  The tip of the Baxter glows. 
               The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Lights go haywire.  Sue knows immediately...

                                   SUE
                         Oh god, Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Lights flicker in darkness.  The door rips open.  Sue lunges
               inside.  She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in
               the chamber.  A beat.  Did it work?  Then...

               Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND.  His eyes flutter back.  Dead...? 
               His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard,
               while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.

                                   SUE
                         What did you do, Reed?  What did you
                         do?

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches every second on his monitors.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Sue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED
               OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  One side of
               his face looks like it's MELTING OFF.

                                   REED
                         I can...make it work.

                                   SUE
                         Reed, stop, you need to rest your --

                                   REED
                         The power...I need...more power...to
                         control...the storm --

                                   SUE
                         You need a doctor.

               Reed loses consciousness.  Sue carries him out.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands.

                                   VICTOR
                         More power...?

               He reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE
               AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON.  His powers growing.

                                   VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                         Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat.

               EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Ben sits alone, looking at city lights.  A man without a
               home.  Without a family.  A hard beat.  HEADLIGHTS slash
               across Ben.  He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a
               LIMO.

                                   LEONARD
                         Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter
                         building.  It's...Reed.

               Ben considers.  Despite it all, he's a good friend.  And a
               good man.  As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC
               IN --

               INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

               LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS.  A young crowd dances and
               grinds to the beat.  Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF
               FLAME swirl around the ceiling.  We follow them to:

               A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. 
               He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get
               a look at his various parlour tricks.

               He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.  Closer.  Candles around
               them start to melt.  Beads of sweat drip down her face.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What do you say we get out of here? 

               She pauses.  And...a very LARGE MAN steps up.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This your boyfriend?

               The Boyfriend doesn't look too happy.

                                   BOYFRIEND
                         Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and
                         stealing chicks...

               Johnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting
               it into a burst of flame.  The Boyfriend drops the glass,
               which SMASHES on the ground...catches the floor on fire.

               The boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out.

                                   GIRLFRIEND
                         What are you doing?!  You could have
                         burned somebody!

               The boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk
               off.  She turns back for one last comment...

                                   GIRLFRIEND (CONT'D)
                         You know, if I had your power I'd be
                         doing something with it, not wasting
                         my time doing cheap bar tricks,
                         hitting on some other guy's girl.

               Johnny looks a little embarrassed.  The couple leaves. 
               Johnny glances around.  His FANS look down, away.  He sees
               how quickly they can turn.  The crowd parts slightly.  He
               looks very alone.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Leonard leads The Thing inside.  The ominous chamber sits
               with its door open.  Victor enters from the control station.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben, come in.

                                   BEN
                         What is this?  Where's Reed?

                                   VICTOR
                         Where do you think?  With Sue.

               Ben looks at the flickering lights.  Suspicious.  Victor
               turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark
               room.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                             (quiet)
                         I'll take it from here, Leonard.

               Leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.

               Leonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         What do you want, Vic?

                                   VICTOR
                         To help you.  I've run every test
                         known to man.  And they all yield the
                         same result: the machine is ready.

               Ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...

                                   BEN
                         Reed said it'd be weeks till --

                                   VICTOR
                         He also said we'd avoid that storm in
                         space.  And we know how that turned
                         out.

               Ben nods.  Reed was wrong before.  Ben gets closer to the
               machine, drawn to it.  He wants to believe, so badly.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         He couldn't generate enough power for
                         the machine to reach critical mass. 
                         Yet another mistake for "Mr.
                         Fantastic."

                                   BEN
                         And you can?  Power it up?

               Victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little SPARK
               around him.  The lights...?  Or his skin...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Yes.  I've found a new energy source.

               He keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course
               with ELECTRICITY.  It starts to build, sparking up his arm.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm
                         again?

               Ben keeps his eyes on the machine.  His dream is alive.

                                   BEN
                         Let's do it.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The chamber doors open.  Thing enters.  He looks around this
               sterile box.  An animal in a cage.  Victor pushes a control;
               the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal.  Thing shuts
               his eyes.  He just wants to be Ben again.

               FROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation
               sequence.  As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in
               the lab.  Energy pumps into the chamber.  The storm swirls
               faster.  Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --

               -- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both
               hands...and WHHHM!  A countdown begins in the control panels. 

               SLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window. 
               The chamber activates.  The storm strikes hard.

               The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony. 
               Struggling violently inside.  To escape?  Extend the moment:
               Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes.

               EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT

               The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie
               glow.  Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of
               the Baxter Building.  The rest of the city lights dim
               slightly.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Reed lies in bed, weak, recuperating.  When the power surges,
               we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that
               someone's using the chamber.  He starts to get out of bed,
               straining to stand with every muscle left in his body.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME

               Sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications.  The lights
               dim.  Power failure.  She looks up...

               EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

               Johnny walks alone.  A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky. 
               He looks up.  His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes
               where it's coming from.  He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris,
               crackling with light.  The chamber rattles dangerously, as
               the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building. 

               And then it's over.  The light dies down...somewhat.  It
               still pulses along with the chamber.  The chamber door SLIDES
               OPEN.

               Beat.  And...BEN GRIMM steps out.  Not The Thing.  No more
               rocks.  BEN GRIMM.  Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN. 

               He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  He
               collapses.  He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.

                                   BEN
                         Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK
                         YOU...VIC?!

               Ben sees a SPARK in shadows.  That spark is...

               VICTOR'S ARM.  Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to
               Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY.  His skin is part
               flesh, part metal.  Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.

               HE IS DOOM.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Vic... What the...?

                                   DOOM
                         Everyone thought I was safe behind
                         those shields...

                                   BEN
                         Victor, the machine worked for me.  It
                         can work for you --

                                   DOOM
                         It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly. 

               Ben starts to realize...

                                   BEN
                         You planned this...?

               Doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from
               his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.

                                   DOOM
                         I've always wanted power.  Now I've
                         got an unlimited supply...

                                   BEN
                         And no Thing to stand in your way. 

               DOOM smiles, nods, stronger than Ben now.

                                   DOOM
                         Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a
                         man looks like who embraces his
                         destiny.

               Doom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying
               backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         One down, three to go.

               Suddenly, WHOOSH!  The lab door flies open.  Reed enters. 
               Doom steps back into the shadows.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Right on cue.

               Reed's eyes go wide.  He sees Ben crumpled in the corner.

                                   REED
                         Oh god Ben.  Are you okay?
                             (amazed)
                         You did it, you really did it...

                                   DOOM
                         No, Reed.  I did.

               Reed slowly turns to see...DOOM.  His body, his face.

                                   REED
                         Victor...?  What, what happened to
                         you?  What did you do to your --

                                   DOOM
                         Exactly what I said I would: I built a
                         better, stronger being.  And
                         outsmarted the great Reed Richards --

                                   REED
                         Victor, this isn't the way to --

                                   DOOM
                             (a dark smile)
                         You always know best.  So tell me. 
                         What happens when you superheat
                         rubber?

               Doom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through
               the huge window!  Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Doom looks out the window, smiling at his old friend's fall.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT

               DING!  The elevator opens.  Doom strides out.  He passes our
               friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka--

               Doom casually SWIPES, sending him through revolving doors.

                                   DOOM
                         Never better, Jimmy.  And it's Doctor
                         Doom now.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali
               watch.  He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't
               get a grip.  His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!  He falls like a
               SLINKY, out of control.  Half his body loose, half hard.

               He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.  He catches
               Reed's face, holds it close.

                                   DOOM
                         Why the long face?

               Doom whips Reed into the night.  As Doom turns, people cower,
               horrified by his face.  They clear out, and...

               Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic
               veins.  A monster.  Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with
               an iron fist, and bounds into the night.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

               Smoke billows, windows are shattered.  Sue races inside,
               seeing Doom's devastation.  Silence, deadly silence. 
               Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift.  BEN crawls out.

                                   SUE
                         Ben?!

               She helps him out of the rubble.  He is beaten, battered.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Sue!

               Johnny comes running in.  He sees the wreckage.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --

                                   SUE
                         No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.

               He nods.  A beat between them.  He looks around, sees Ben.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Jesus, Ben!
                             (eyeing him)
                         I go away, look what happens.  You got
                         a lot of explaining to do.

               He motions to the wreckage.

                                   BEN
                             (struggling, weak)
                         The machine works.  And Vic's gone
                         Mister Hyde on us --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Really?  With a name like Von Doom? 
                         Never saw that one coming.

               Sue looks around.  Only one question.  Dead serious:

                                   SUE
                         Where is Reed?

                                   BEN
                         Victor must've taken him.

               INT. VON DOOM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to
               the opening scene.  Those mysterious CRATES loom in shadows. 
               He wears a green HOOD, and METAL MASK over his scarred face. 

               Doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.

                                   DOOM
                         Chemistry 101, Part Two.  What
                         happens to rubber when it's super-
                         cooled?

               We now see what he sees: Reed sits in a chair with TUBES
               INJECTED into his skin FREEZING HIM SOLID!  Ultra-cold vapor
               coats him.  Doom steps closer, a sadistic smile.

               Reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Allow me.

               He PRESSES DOWN on one of Reed's fingers, which makes a
               horrific CRACKING SOUND.  Reed's face twists with pain.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Painful...?

               Doom seems to enjoy every CRACK.  He leans closer.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         You don't know the meaning of the
                         word.

               Doom lets up on Reed and reaches into a crate, and pulls out
               a military-issue ROCKET-LAUNCHER.  He aims at the city
               skyline, locking onto his target: JOHNNY STORM.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         But you will.

               Johnny's HEAT SIGNATURE glows.  The screen flashes: TARGET
               ACQUIRED.  Doom looks back at Reed, his launcher aimed
               casually over his shoulder.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Flame off.

               BOOOOM!  He fires without looking!  A MISSILE blasts into the
               sky.  THE MISSILE LIGHTS UP THE DARK NIGHT beginning its wide
               turn towards its target.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING

               Johnny, Ben, and Sue hear the missile being fired and turn to
               the window -- it BANKS, coming STRAIGHT for them.  They move
               to --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING BALCONY - NIGHT

               Johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the
               missile streaking closer.  As he moves, the missile SHIFTS
               slightly with HIS MOTION!  His eyes narrow, thinking.

               He FLAMES ON a HAND.  He waves his flaming hand, and the
               MISSILE locks onto the fire!  Johnny darkens, realizing...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Great.  Heat-seeker.

               His mind races.  He makes a decision, and steps up onto the
               ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Sis.  Let me take care of you for
                         once.

                                   SUE
                         But Johnny...you can't fly.

               Johnny considers, a half-beat.  He looks out.  Under breath:

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well then this'll be one hell of a
                         basejump.

               Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF
               THE EDGE!  He FLAMES ON!  The missile follows his arc.  As he
               drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (under breath)
                         Come on...come on...come on...

               He falls lower, lower.  And...he...BANKS!  SWOOPS UP! 
               FLYING!

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         FLAME ON.

               Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.

                                   BEN
                         We need to help Reed --

               Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, you got what we all wanted. 
                         You need to stay here.  It's too
                         dangerous.

               She heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Ben steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered
               window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat.

                                   BEN
                         What...what have I done?

               EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

               Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and
               turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More
               people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Eerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He
               hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom
               even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. 
               And...

               A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being
               manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next
               to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm.

                                   SUE
                         What has he done to you?

               Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.

                                   DOOM (O.S.)
                         How romantic.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, please --

                                   DOOM
                         It's Doctor Doom to you.

               He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin.

                                   SUE
                         We know the machine works.  It worked
                         on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can
                         turn you back --

                                   DOOM
                         Do you really think fate turned us
                         into gods so we could refuse these
                         gifts?

               She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.

                                   SUE
                         Victor.  You always thought you were
                         god.

               Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.

                                   DOOM
                         Sue please, let's not fight.

                                   SUE
                         No, Victor... Let's.

               She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him
               back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. 
               Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity.

                                   DOOM
                         Susan...... You're fired.

               BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. 
               She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING
               to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her
               strength to...GO INVISIBLE.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Marco...

               A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Polo.

               He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to
               the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible.

               In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and
               out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through
               the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...?

               EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

               Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet
               behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots:

               A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast,
               Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. 
               VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly.

               He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes
               in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- 

               JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles
               through the air, we CUT BACK TO --

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. 
               Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.

               Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes
               every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes
               a CRACCCKKKKING sound.

                                   DOOM
                         One more down.  Now it's just the
                         scientist and his specimen.

               Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He
               has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips
               and get the words out.

                                   REED
                         Sue.  The only thing I ever knew
                         without thinking was...
                             (his lips fully freezing)
                         I...love...

               He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue
               whispers to him:

                                   SUE
                         Me too, Reed.

               Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.

                                   DOOM
                             (quiet, cruel)
                         And so four became none.  It's my time
                         now.

               BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH!

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Actually, Vic...

               Reed recognizes the voice.  So do we.  Doom turns to see... 

               BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING.  Back in rocky, fighting form.

                                   BEN
                         IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!

               Doom turns, just as --

               BAM!  Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever
               been hit.  The force sends Doom back through the air, toward
               the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V"
               sculpture.  It SNAPS, crashing onto him.  A few sparks.  Then
               nothing.

               Nothing at all.  No more movement.  Doom is dead.

               Ben turns to Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Damn, I've been wanting to do that.

               Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting
               the tubes from Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                             (Reed's words)
                         Victor's "not that bad," huh?  Just "a
                         little larger than life"?  Maybe
                         you'll listen to me next time before --

               WHMM!  The WRECKAGE shifts.  They turn to see...Doom EMERGES. 
               He stands, power coursing.  And he CHARGES at Ben!  Ben
               charges back.  And these two behemoths...

               SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!

               EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

               Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.  On the ground,
               PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.  Doom and Ben SMASH through
               the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

               BOOOOM!  Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the
               glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL.  People scream, run.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD.  Their combined weight
               CRACKS the floor of the pool.  A YOUNG BOY watches underwater
               through his MASK.  Doom and Ben square off, but...

               The CRACKS OPEN WIDER!  And they're PULLED toward the HOLE! 
               WHOOSH!  The water is all sucked out of the hole.  The boy
               holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --

               INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall.  Roaring rapids
               head straight for him.  He jams his key into the lock,
               turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as
               the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to --

               EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

               SMASH!  Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the
               TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

               CRASH!  Water floods the street.  Doom and Ben land in a
               large GARBAGE TRUCK.  The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING
               from the inside.  Grunts, growls.

               CRASH!  The truck suddenly STOPS.  COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,
               sirens screaming.  And --

               BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.  SMASH!  Ben
               lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks
               the WINDSHIELD.  Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water
               flooding the street around him.  COP CARS converge on Doom. 

               Doom turns his attention to the cops.  His limbs SPARK with
               electricity, ready to fire at the cars.

               EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

               Ben sees the cops and Doom.  He knows the cops are dead meat. 
               He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.

                                   BEN
                         Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your
                         car?

               She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.

                                   OLD LADY
                         The clutch sticks a little.

                                   BEN
                         Not gonna be a problem.

               Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.  WHMM!  It FLIES
               through the air, and WHAM!  Hits hard, knocking Doom back
               twenty feet!  As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

               BOOM!  Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!  CRASH! 
               Windows shatter.  The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,
               snapping the pole.  Doom steps out, unharmed.

               Ben CHARGES toward him.  Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY
               POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a
               giant STUN-GUN!  Electric sparks FLY through the air into -- 

               BEN!  The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!  He goes
               FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --

               WHOOMPF!  Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street! 
               Water rushes into the crater.  Ben lays there, incapacitated.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME

               On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.  Doom
               strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the
               death-blow.  Currents surge.  Right before he swings down --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I can't let you do that.

               Simple, strong.  Doom turns to see...REED.  Alone.  Bruised
               and battered.  Slowly stepping toward him.  Doom smiles.

                                   DOOM
                         And you can't stop me.

               He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING
               DOWN!  Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.

               Something invisible.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Hello Susan.

               She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. 
               Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It
               skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet.

               Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         What is this?  The pitiful three?

               Doom steps toward them, but --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Four.

               WHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a
               flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.

               Johnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of
               them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Had a little relapse, huh?

               Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Welcome back.

               They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed
               and melted, making him look all the more menacing.

                                   DOOM
                         This is going to be fun.

               Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at
               the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a
               thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!

               He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He
               holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in
               buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. 

               He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of
               control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires
               SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move:

               Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. 

               Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges
               surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --

               Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-
               flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize
               fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field
               and --

               SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar
               starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! 
               They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- 

               Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is
               holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas
               holding the world.  People run out, safe.

               ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.

                                   REED
                         JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!

               Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the
               wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. 

               Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The
               impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed.

                                   SUE
                         Can't...hold...on...

               Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands,
               vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! 

               He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he
               forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.

               Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body,
               RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without
               breaking.  He strains, agonizing.

                                   REED
                         Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         But all these people...

                                   REED
                         Now.

               Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting
               build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything.
               Johnny GRABS DOOM.

                                   THING
                             (quiet, smiling)
                         Flame on, kid.

               FLASH!  Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,
               which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed
               doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now.

                                   REED
                         Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
                         frustration --

                                   SUE
                             (looking at Doom)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and
               the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.

               Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER
               BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which
               WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). 

               Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.
               Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it
               in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the
               point that it's blinding.  People look away.

               Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the
               ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her
               knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As
               everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And --

               DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body
               GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look
               devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed.

                                   DOOM
                         Is that the best you can do...?  A
                         little heat...?

               Reed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head.

                                   REED
                         Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101:
                         what happens when you supercool hot
                         metal...?
                             (to Ben)
                         Ben...

                                   BEN
                         Got it, teach.

               He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.  The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben
               kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays
               toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...

               The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and
               SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!

                                   DOOM
                         No.

               Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING
               DOOM.  GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling
               metal.  DOOM screams.  His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE. 

               The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely
               obscuring Doom from view.  A beat.  The steam clears to
               reveal:

               DOOM.  A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of
               METAL.  Frozen forever.  Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The
               Fantastic Four -- exhale.  They stand as one, in roiling
               smoke.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Damn, I love this job.

               Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.

                                   BEN
                         Job, huh...?

               Will they accept their mantle?  Reed shrugs.

                                   REED
                         Well, we do have the suits...

               They give weary smiles.  A team.  Sue gets close to Reed.

                                   SUE
                         You know, about what we said up there,
                         I think maybe --

               THHM!  He KISSES HER.  His neck extending.  Strong, powerful. 
               He pulls back slightly, smiles at her.  A new strength in
               him.

                                   BEN
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

               Sue looks at Reed.  A long way from that conference room.

                                   SUE
                         Hilarious.

               As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding.  The sun
               rises around them.  The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn
               of a new day.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               INT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - BANQUET ROOM - DUSK

               Reed and Sue kiss on the deck of the Circle Line as it chugs
               around New York City.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Dude, that's still my sister.

               A PARTY IN PROGRESS.  Drinks, food, music.  We see in the
               crowd a familiar faces: O'HOOLIHAN (cast on his arm),
               bartender ERNIE, others.  JOHNNY and BEN stand behind Reed
               and Sue.

               Reed and Sue pull apart.  Reed turns to Ben, excited.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I've been crunching the numbers
                         on the machine.  I think if we can
                         rework the power settings...

                                   BEN
                         Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.

                                   ALICIA (O.S.)
                         That's my Benny.

               She hands Ben a big METAL MUG.  Ben takes the mug.  He
               CLINKS, but SHATTERS her glass.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         We're going to have to work on your
                         touch.

                                   BEN
                         I like the sound of that.

               Alicia gets close.  A soft smile.  Reed turns to Sue.

                                   REED
                         Sue, can I talk to you for a second?

               Reed leads her out.  Ben and Johnny swap a glance.

               EXT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - DECK - DUSK

               A romantic view of the city-scape.  Reed stands with Sue.

                                   REED
                         I found a broken gasket, from space --

                                   SUE
                         A gasket?  Reed, we're at a party.

               He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just
               about the size of......a RING.  Sue slows down.

                                   REED
                         If one of us were to wear it...

               She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret. 

               Reed looks her square in the eye.  Unflinching.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  What are you doing?

               Reed drops to his knees.  His head stays eye-level, while his
               body drops.  Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.

                                   REED
                         No more thinking, no more variables...
                         Sue Storm...will you...
                             (she's gone)
                         Sue?  Sue?  You there?

               Dead silence.  And then...

               THE RING DISAPPEARS.  SUE IS WEARING IT.

                                   SUE (V.O.)
                         Yes.

               Reed goes to kiss her.

                                   SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.

               INSIDE: the party applauds.  Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move
               through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.  As they go --

                                   BEN
                         No more cracks about how I look.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.
                             (weaving around bodies)
                         Clear the way, wide load coming
                         through.

               Ben glares, fists clenched.  Johnny smiles, mischievous, as
               they hit the balcony.  And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the
               air, blazing the NUMBER "FOUR" enclosed in a circle of flame
               (their future callsign), over the city skyline.  The crowd
               oohs and aahs.  Ben watches, unimpressed.

                                   BEN
                         Showoff.

               People drink, laugh, dance.  We slowly PULL BACK from the
               party, the boat, the city, and...CUT TO --

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               CLOSE ON: the MELTED FACE of DOOM.  He is placed in a wooden
               crate.  LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his
               cell.

               As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of
               ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.  Leonard's CELLPHONE goes
               STATICKY.  His eyes narrow.  Could it be...?  And --

               SLAM.  The door closes.  We can read the destination through
               stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.  And we pull back to reveal
               the box is on the deck of:

               A FREIGHTER SHIP.  The ship pulls away, steaming into the
               horizon, as we...

          RAY (V.O.)
          My fathers name was John Kinsella.
          A faded, sepia shot of a dirty little kid on a farm.

          RAY (V.O.)
          Its an Irish name. He was born in
          North Dakota, in 1896...
          Young man in doughboy uniform.

          RAY (V.O.)
          ...and never saw a big city until he
          came back from France in 1918.
          Chicago. Tenement. Comiskey Park. Ballgames.

          RAY (V.O.)
          He settled in Chicago, where he quickly
          learned to live and die with the White
          Sox. Died a little when they lost the
          1919 World Series...

          RAY (V.O.)
          ...died a lot the following summer when
          eight members of the team were accused
          of throwing that Series.
          Dad (a catcher) playing ball. At work. Weeding.

          RAY (V.O.)
          He played in the minors for a year or
          two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved
          to Brooklyn in 35, married Mom in 38,
          and was already an old man working at
          the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949.

          in miniature Dodger uniform, etc.

          RAY (V.O.)
          My names Ray Kinsella. Mom died when
          I was three, and I suppose Dad did the
          best he could. Instead of Mother Goose,
          I was put to bed at night to stories of

          Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great
          Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees
          fan then, so of course I rooted for
          Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved
          away, so we had to find other things to
          fight about. We did. And when it came
          time to go to college, I picked the
          farthest one from home I could find.
          Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc.

          RAY (V.0.)
          This, of course, drove him right up the
          wail, which I suppose was the point.
          Officially my major was English, but
          really it was the Sixties.
          Ray looking foolish in long hair and tie-dye.

          RAY (V.O.)
          I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried
          to like sitar music... and I met Annie.
          Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.

          RAY (V.0.)
          The only thing we had in common was that
          she came from Iowa and I had once heard
          of Iowa. We moved in together. After
          graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and
          stayed with her family as long as we
          could.
          Unsmiling American Gothic types.

          RAY (V.O.)
          Almost a full afternoon.
          The apartment, Ray at different jobs, the wedding.

          RAY (V.0.)
          We rented an apartment and I took a job
          selling insurance. I also drove a cab
          and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died
          in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married
          that fail.

          RAY (V.O.)
          A few years later Karin was born. She
          smelled weird, but we loved her anyway.
          Then Annie got the crazy idea that she
          could talk me into buying a farm.

          their farm. Ray in a cornfield.

          RAY (V.0.)
          I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm about
          to become a farmer. I love my family,
          I love baseball, and I miss New York.
          Moving in on Ray's face.

          RAY (V.0.)
          But until I heard The Voice...I'd never
          done a crazy thing in my whole life.

          2 THE CORNFIELD - DUSK

                         2
          It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg
          blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray
          Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like
          that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the
          source of this sound. All around him are empty fields.
          He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to
          work.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this
          voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual
          -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away,
          the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three
          sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where
          Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming.

                         RAY

                         (CALLS)
          Annie, what was that?

          What was what?

                         RAY
          That voice.

                         ANNIE
          What voice?

          Just now. Like an announcement.
          Annie confers briefly with Karin, then calls back to Ray.

                         ANNIE
          We didn't hear anything.

                         RAY
          Oh.
          Ray thinks for a second, then shakes it off, trying to
          dislodge that thought from his mind, and gets back to work.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Again, he bolts upright and looks around. Again, he sees
          nothing. This is beginning to bug him. He calls:

                         RAY
          Okay, you must've heard that.

          3 ON THE PORCH

          Annie and Karin lock at each other and exchange a shrug.
          Annie extends her arms palms upward, and calls to Ray.

                         ANNIE
          Sorry. Come on. Dinner.
          Annie leads Karin inside.

          Ray looks all around him with an "Okay, fellas, what's the
          joke?" look on his face. But there is no one there. He
          puts down his tools and walks toward the house.

          5 INT. KITCHEN

          Ray enters, looks at his wife skeptically and joins his
          wife and daughter setting the table.

                         RAY
          Was there like a sound truck on the
          highway, or something?

                         ANNIE
          Nape.

          Nope. You really hearing voices?

                         RAY
          Just one.

          More like a. . .ballpark announcer.
          Annie shoots him an "Are you kidding?" look. Ray responds
          with a shrug. They sit down to eat.

                         ANNIE

          They are snuggled together, asleep. All is quiet. Then:

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray's eyes pop open. He looks at Annie, who does not stir.
          Without moving, he looks around the room. There is no one
          there. Very quietly, he crosses to the window and looks
          out. He whispers out toward the cornfield:

                         RAY
          Build what? For who?

          It's okay, honey, I'm just-talking to
          the cornfield.
          He sighs and goes back to bed. Annie cuddles up to him.
          Her eyes are closed, but Ray's eyes remain open. He is
          puzzled and concerned.

          Why'd you do that? It was funny.

          and school bag. Let's go.

          picks up. He stops fora moment, cocks an ear and looks
          around. All he sees are the empty fields. Insects make

          of the cornfield between him and the house.

          13 A BASEBALL FIELD L3
          For the briefest of moments, the dreamlike image of a
          baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares
          in over the lawn. Standing on the edge of the field, is
          the figure of a man with his back to us. Before we can see
          anything else, the image disappears.

          man. He stands in the middle distance, silhouetted by the
          lights, and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind.
          He starts to turn slowly towards us, but before we can see
          his face, the image disappears.

          neck of an athlete. As he slowly turns we start to see a

                         RAY
          Thank you.
          Annie smiles, but sees that Ray is troubled. She hugs him.

                         ANNIE
          Oh, sweetie. I hope you know that even
          though I make jokes, I'm going to visit
          you every month wherever they put you.
          He offers her a weak smile and exits.

          It is dark. For a few seconds it is quiet. Then:

                         RAY
          Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing?

                         ANNIE
          If I did, I'd forgotten it.
          Ray sits up in the dark.

                         RAY
          I always felt cheated I never got to see
          him play. He was supposed to be so
          graceful, and agile. So to actually get
          to see him play again...to let him play
          again, to right an old wrong...
          He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it. Annie
          turns on the light.

                         ANNIE
          Wait a minute, Bosco. Are you actually
          thinking of doing this?

           No.

                         (THEN)
          I mean, I can't think of one good reason
          why I should,-but...
          (takes a breath)
          I'm thirty-eight years old, I have a
          wife, a child, and a mortgage, and I'm
          scared to death I'm turning into my
          father.

                         ANNIE
          What's your father got to do with this?
          Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks
          softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of
          meaning for him.

                         RAY
          I never forgave him for getting old.
          By the time he'was as old as I am now,
          he was ancient. He must have had
          dreams, but he never did anything about
          them. For all I know, he may have even
          heard voices, too, but he sure didn't
          listen to them. The man never did one
          spontaneous thing in all the years I
          knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's
          what growing up means. I'm afraid of
          that happening to me. And something
          tells me this may be my last chance to
          do something about it.
          (looks at her)
          I want to build that field. Do you
          think I'm crazy?
          She looks at him with great understanding.

                         ANNIE
          Yes.
          He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly.

                         ANNIE
          I also think that if you feel you really
          have to do this... then you should do it.
          They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when
          he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms.
          Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting.

          26 THE CORNFIELD - DAY

                         26
          Stalks of corn wave slowly in the breeze. A bee buzzes
          near one. The light is yellow. Suddenly, the stalks bend
          violently to the ground as Ray's tractor plows them under.

          27 ON THE TRACTOR 27
          Ray drives, Karin rides shotgun, holding the large detailed
          diagram Ray has drawn of the ballpark's dimensions.

                         RAY
          Ty Cobb called him the greatest left
          fielder of all time. His glove was
          called 'the place where triples go to
          die.'

                         28 HIGH ANGLE 28
           The tractor turns to plow under more corn, and we can see
           the size of the area Ray has staked off with marker sticks.

           KARIN (V.0.)
           Could he hit?

           RAY (V.O.)
           Lifetime 356 average. Third highest
          in history.
          Karin whistles.

                         29 ANOTHER ANGLE 29
          By the side of the road, an old man and woman stand and
          watch these neighbors-plow under their. corn. They look at
          each other as if to say "Could it be Communists?"

          KARIN (V.0.)
          Why'd they called him Shoeless Joe?

          30 SEEDING THE FIELD - DAY 30
          It is days later, an area the size of a baseball field has
          been plowed under, and Ray is seeding it.

          RAY (V.O.)
          When he was still in the minors, he
          bought a new pair of spikes and they
          hurt his feet. About the sixth inning
          he took them off and played the outfield
          in just his socks. The other players
          kidded him, called him Shoeless Joe, and
          the name stuck.

          31 WATERING THE GRASS - NIGHT- 31
          We can see roughly where the grass has been planted, and
          where the dirt will be smoothed out for the base paths.
          Ray stands stock-still in the moonlight, water hose in
          hand, patiently misting the baby grass, little Karin at his
          side.

          RAY (V.0.)
          Then in 1919, his team, the Chicago
          White Sox, threw the World Series.

          KARIN (V.0.)
          What's 'threw'?

          RAY (V.0.)
          They lost it on purpose. Gamblers paid
          them to.

          32 SIDE OF THE ROAD

                         32
          Now, dozens of families stand to watch silent and
          dumb-eyed, at what has obviously become a daily spectacle
          among the townspeople. Some snap photos.

          RAY (V.0.)
          Except Shoeless Joe.

          33 SMOOTHING OUT THE FIELD - DAY
          Ray smooths out the base paths with a large roller, as
          Annie and Karin follow behind with rakes. On either side
          of the base paths, the infield and outfield grass is
          growing.

          RAY (V.0.)
          Nobody could prove anything one way or
          another, but he was the one guy who
          probably wasn't in on it.

          Ray, Annie and Karin wait as the cashier totals up their
          load of lumber and hardware.

                         RAY
          I mean if he was supposed to be throwing
          it, how do you explain the fact he hit
          375 for the series and didn't commit
          one error? Huh?

                         KARIN
          I can't.

          home run. And they said he was trying
          to lose!

                         KARIN
          It's ridiculous.

                         CASHIER
          That's 855 dollars, sixty-four cents.
          From O.S., we hear oooh. Ray turns and notices for the
          first time that a crowd of spectators -- employees and
          customers -- has been watching him and whispering among
          themselves. They look at him as if he had two heads.
          Ray turns his attention back to writing a check for his
          purchases. He deadpans to Annie:

                         RAY
          We'd better notify Mars to send us more
          money.

                         ANNIE

                         (EQUALLY DEADPAN)
          Remlak won't like that.

                         RAY
          That's his problem. And tell him to
          make it in Earth dollars this time.
          Ray hands over the check to the open-mouthed cashier.

                         RAY
          Thank you. Have a nice day.
          Ray and Annie turn and leave with Karin. The farmers
          watch, obviously trying hard to figure this one out.

          annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the
          uniformed employees of the store. He turns to catch the
          Store Owner staring at him the most intently.

          tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put

          Inside the house, Annie is doing spring cleaning. She
          looks out the window to see:

          44 THE BASEBALL FIELD
          Ray mowing the outfield grass. He stops, looks around,
          listens, hears nothing, and continues mowing.

                         45
          just watches him.

          We see the first exhibition game of spring training from
          Florida, as the announcer talks about a "southpaw" pitcher.

          47 INT. RAY AND ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 47

          Little Karin watches the TV, while Annie and Ray sit at the
          living room table, financial ledgers spread out before them
          as they struggle with their accounts.

                         KARIN
          Daddy, what's a southpaw?

          A left-handed pitcher.

                         (TO ANNIE)
          How bad is it?

                         ANNIE
          Well, given how much less acreage we
          have for corn, I'd say we'll probably
          .almost break even.

                         RAY
          Jesus.

                         ANNIE
          We've spent all our savings on that
          field.

          KARIN (O.S.)
          Daddy..

                         RAY
          Just a minute, Karin.

                         (TO ANNIE)
          So what are you saying? We can't keep
          the field?

                         ANNIE

                         (SADLY)
          It makes it real hard to keep the farm,
          Ray.
          Ray closes his eyes.

          KARIN (O.S.)
          Daddy...

                         RAY
          (a little testy)
          In a minute, Karin.

          KARIN (O.S.)
          There's a man out there on your lawn.
          Ray opens his eyes and turns to see Karin kneeling on the
          kitchen counter, looking out the window. Ray and Annie
          exchange a quick glance, and Ray walks to the window.

          48 EXT. THE WINDOW


                         48
          seen from outside, as Ray's head appears and looks out.
          He sees something out there and just looks at it.

          49 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW

                          49
           There is a Man standing on the edge ofthebaseballfield.
          Hi es wearing a baseball uniform.
          Anold-fashionedone.

                         50 INT HOUSE

                         50
          Ray turns to Annie. She looks out and nods thoughtfully.
          Annie stays very calm in emergencies.

                         ANNIE
          We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead.
          Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The
          night sky seems close enough to touch.

          51 EXT. HOUSE


                         51
          On the porch wall, Ray finds the switch, holds his breath,
          flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life.

                         52 THE MAN

                         52
          steps onto the field. On his uniform is a large "S" with
          an "O" in the top crook, an "X" in the bottom, and an
          American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve.

                         53 RAY

                         53
          walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field.

          54 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW

                         54
          Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in
          left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the
          waist, hands on hips, he waits.

                         55 RAY

                         55
          Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one
          of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back
          of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.

          56 IN THE OUTFIELD

                         56
          The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style
          glove, and waits to field the ball.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         24

          57 AT HOME PLATE 57
          Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at
          it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat,
          and tries again. This time he connects.

                         58 THE FIELD 58
          He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a
          shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and
          falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it
          up cleanly and throws it back to the plate.
          Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this
          too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man
          deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him.

                         RAY
          How's the field play?

                         THE MAN
          It's good. The ball bounces true.
          Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives
          it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually
          lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man
          sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in
          short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man
          runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.

                         RAY
          Hi.
          The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel
          its weight.

                         RAY
          Ray Kinsella.

                         THE MAN
          Joe Jackson.
          Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless
          Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from
          him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if
          he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there.
          Finally, he can't help himself.

                         RAY
          I bet its good to be playing again,
          huh?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          It was like having part of me amputated.

                         25

                         58 CONTINUED
          Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain
          his steady voice tries to conceal.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          I've heard that old man wake up and
          scratch itchy legs that've been dust for
          fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up
          in the night with the smell of the
          ballpark in my nose and the cool of the
          grass on my feet. The thrill of the
          grass...
          He has found the bat he likes.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Can you pitch?

                         RAY

                         (WITH FALSE

                         MODESTY)
          Yeah, I'm not bad.
          Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain
          his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the
          rubber and faces Joe at the plate.

                         RAY
          Don't we need a catcher?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Not if you can get it near the plate,
          we don't.
          Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during
          which he says aloud to himself:

                         RAY
          I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
          He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has
          to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is
          graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the
          ball against the fence.
          Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson
          is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch.
          Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.

                         RAY
          See if you can hit my curve.
          °He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not
          curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.

                         CONTINUED

                         RAY
          Yes, he can hit the curve.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Stick with fast balls, kid.

                         RAY
          You bet.
          Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down
          the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base
          line. Ray is mightily impressed.

                         RAY
          Wow.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Damn, this feels good. Put it right
          here, huh?
          Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches
          it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of
          the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.

                         RAY
          Right, you were a low ball hitter.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Oh man, I did love this game. You know,
          I'd have played for food money. it was
          the game, the sounds, the smells. You
          ever held a glove or a ball to your
          face?
          Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.

                         RAY
          Yeah.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          And it was riding the trains from town
          to town. And the hotels with brass
          spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds
          in the rooms. And it was the crowd
          getting to their feet when the ball was
          hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for
          free.
          The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the
          house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them.

                         RAY
          My family.
          Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights.

          Uh, thanks, but...I don't think I can.
          Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite
          understanding the ground rules here. Joe senses their
          discomfort and changes the subject.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Hey, can I come back again?

                         RAY
          Yeah. I built this for you.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          There are others, you know. There were
          eight of us. It'd sure mean a lot to
          them.

                         RAY
          Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome
          here.
          Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the
          good times to come.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Thank you, Ray. I appreciate it. See
          you later, huh?

          Say it ain't so, Joe!
          Joe laughs and walks to the outfield. Annie puts her arm
          around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest.
          Nearby, brook water splashes softly in the darkness, a frog
          shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night.
          Joe is in the outfield grass now, walking toward a door cut
          into the fence.

          Joe reaches the door, opens it, and turns back to Ray, his
          voice carrying effortlessly through the night air.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Hey! Is this heaven?

                         RAY
          No. It's Iowa.
          Shoeless Joe Jackson nods and fades away as he walks
          through the door in the fence. Ray and Annie looks at each
          other in absolute wonder.

                         RAY
          We're keeping this field.

          You're going to lose your farm, pal.
          It is Sunday afternoon, and Annie's family is visiting.
          her mother, pink-faced and white-dentured, sits ramrod
          straight in an antique rocking chair. Also present are her
          brother, Mark, and his wife Dee.

                         RAY
          Come on, it's so big. How can you lose
          something so big?

                         ANNIE
          You misplaced the house once.

                         RAY
          Yeah, but it turned up two days later,
          didn't it?

                         MARK
          Ray, this stupid baseball field is going
          to bankrupt you. Everybody knows it.
          All I'm saying is if you wait till you
          default on your loan, you lose

          Karin enters breathlessly.

                         KARIN
          Daddy, the baseball game is on.
          Ray beams. Karin returns the smile and reaches her arms
          out to be picked up. She scissors her legs around her
          father at belt level, hugging his neck.

                         RAY
          Excuse us.
          He exits, carrying Karin. Mark shakes his head.

          He used to be so normal.

          Her mother gasps.

          Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while
          Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three,
          including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in
          the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.)
          The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the
          sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five
          years to the game they love.
          Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder.

                         RAY
          Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the
          pitcher gets the sign and starts to
          pitch. A good left fielder knows what
          pitch is coming, and he can tell from
          the.angle of the bat where the ball's
          going to be hit.
          At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes
          five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches
          up, and the ball smacks into his glove.
          Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos.

          The good-natured banter stops short, and the other players
          glare at Weaver who looks sheepishly toward the little girl
          and her father in the bleachers.

          from the players on the, field.

          Oh, I guess it's not really a game.
          It's more like a practice.
          Mark looks at his wife and Mother with concern. Ray
          doesn't understand this reaction.

                         RAY
          See, there's only eight of them, so they

          Now, Mother and Dee look as if they're about to go into

          Right. See you guys.
          The players call their "good-byes" to Ray and head for the
          door in the outfield fence. Ray watches them fade out as
          they go through the door. Then he takes a moment to look
          around him.
          The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite
          beautiful. Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back

          Parents stream in past the "PTA Meeting Tonite" sign. Ray
          and Annie stand by the doorway, talking with Miss Corser,
          Karin's teacher. (Ray is too distracted by his own
          thoughts to pay this much attention.)

                         MISS CORSER
          Karin has such a wonderful imagination.
          Lately, she's been making up these
          charming little stories about ghosts who
          play baseball in a cornfield... wonderful
          imagination.

          Yes. She gets that from Ray.
          Miss Corser smiles approvingly. Ray realizes both women
          are looking at him, now, and he emerges from his thoughts.

          65 INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - NIGHT


                         65
          Ray and Annie -- along with a hundred or so other grownups
          -- are sitting in chairs too small for their grownup
          backsides. Ray is still lost in his own thoughts, doodling
          "Ease his pain" over and over again, while an Irate Mother
          has the floor, holding up a novel.

                         IRATE MOTHER
          .and I say smut and filth like this has
          no place in our schools!
          A large portion of the audience applauds. Annie whispers
          snarlingly to Ray:

                         ANNIE
          Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain.
          Ray is still lost in thought.

                         PRINCIPAL
          Mrs. Perkins, the book you are waving
          about is hardly smut. It is considered
          by many critics as the classic novel
          about growing up in the 1960s.

                         ANNIE
          (whispers to Ray)
          I read it four times. Funniest book I
          ever read.

                         IRATE MOTHER
          It's pornography!

                         PRINCIPAL
          The Supreme Court said its not. And
          its author, Mr. Mann ---

                         ANGRY FATHER
          -- is sick!

                         PRINCIPAL
          Terence Mann is a Pulitzer prize-winner,
          and was widely regarded as the finest
          satirist of his time.

                         IRATE MOTHER
          Well I think he's a pervert, and quite
          probably a Communist, too!

          What planet are these people from?
          Ray looks as if he is starting to realize something.

                         (READING FROM

                         NOTES)
          The se-called novels of Terence Mann
          endorse promiscuity, godlessness, the
          mongrelization of races, and disrespect
          to high-ranking officers of the United
          States Army. And that's why right-
          thinking school boards all across the
           country have been banning this guy's
          shit since 1969.

          Terence Mann...

          You know why he stopped writing books?
          Because he masturbates!

                         (TO RAY)

                         ANNIE

                         (VERY REASONABLY)
          Excuse me, madam, but you're speaking
          of something about which you don't know
          squat. Terence Mann was a warm and
          gentle voice of.reason during a time of
          great madness. He coined the phrase
          'Make Love, Not War.' When others were
          chanting 'Burn, baby, burn,' he was
          writing about love, and peace, and
          understanding. He helped define an era.
          And a generation. And he helped us
          laugh at ourselves. I cherished every
          one of his books, and I dearly wish he'd
          write more. And if you had experienced
          even a little bit of the Sixties, you
          might feel the same way, too.

          No. I think you had two Fifties, and
          moved right on to the Seventies.

                         IRATE MOTHER
          Oh yeah? Well your husband plowed under
          his corn and built a baseball field!
          The crowd "oohs" and "aahs."

                         ANNIE
          Now there's an intelligent response.

                         IRATE MOTHER
          The weirdo.
          Ray is so excited at his revelation that he really wants
          to leave immediately. He tugs Annie's sleeve.

                         RAY
          Annie...
          But Annie mistakes her husband's intentions. She thinks
          he is cautioning her not to get embroiled in trouble.

                         ANNIE

                         (TO RAY)

                         PARENT)
          At least he's not a book burner, you

          Now the crowd erupts.

                         IRATE PARENT

          Annie pulls herself up to her full 5'4" and thrusts an
          angry finger at. the woman.

                         ANNIE
          All right Beulah, you wanna step
          outside?!? Huh?
          The other woman takes a half-step backward. No one has
          ever seen sweet Annie like this.

                         ANNIE

          United Sates? Anybody?
          The majority who had sided with the book-banner wants to
          vote for censorship, but under these terms just can't raise
          their arms. Little Annie is on a roll, now.

          a pretty good thing? Let's see those

          kind of censorship they have in Russia?
          Reluctantly, just about everyone raises their hands. Annie

          By the early Seventies, the guy decides
          people have become either too extremist
          or too apathetic to listen to him. So
          he stops writing books. He starts
          writing poetry. About whales and stuff.
          Then, he starts fooling around with a
          home computer, and gets hooked. Know

          Annie laughs at that. Ray is so excited, he laughs too.

                         RAY
          It's not his best work, but the hero of
          the story, a character that Mann created
          twenty-six years ago, is named John
          Kinsella. My father.
          She stops short.

          He gives her a "See? What'd I tell you?" look.

          What can I say... Big wow, but..what's
          it got to do with baseball?

          Okay. The last interview-he ever gave
          was in 1973. Guess what it's about.

                         ANNIE
          Mmm. Some kind of team sport?

          He finds a page and reads from it:

          'As a child, my earliest recurring dream
          was to play at Ebbets Field with Jackie
          Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Of
          course, it never happened, and the
          Dodgers left Brooklyn, and they torn
          down Ebbets Field. But even now, I
          still dream that dream.'

          They have arrived home and are walking into the house. He
          is still spouting things to her his research has uncovered.

          The man wrote the best books of his
          generation, he was a pioneer in the
          civil rights and anti-war movements, he
          made the cover of Newsweek, he knew
          everybody, he did everyting...he helped
          shape his time. He hung out with the
          Beatles! But in the end, it wasn't
          enough. What he missed ...was'baseball.
          Annie takes a look at Ray's handful of Xeroxes.

                         RAY
          No it's not. It's pretty weird, I grant
          you, but building the field was weirder.
          Five, ten percent weirder.

          I'm sorry, pal, but I have to nip this

          Annie, this is really new territory for
          both of us, I know, but we're dealing
          with primal forces of nature, here.

          supposed to do it. I feel it. I feel
          it as strongly as I've ever felt
          anything in my life. There's a reason.

          But by her raised eyebrows and the tone of her voice, it

          storefront with blacked-out windows. He enters an open
          hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as
          well as stairs to the apartments above it.
          There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall. Ray checks
          the names. He smiles.

          Ray turns to the storefront door. Instead of a buzzer
          there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from
          a hole at the top of the door. Next to the wire is a
          handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You
          better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell."
          Ray laughs. This guy is great. He pulls on the wire. On
          the other side of the door, a bell rings.
          Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness. He takes
          a breath. He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door.
          He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of
          meeting one of his cultural heroes.
          The door opens. Terence Mann is menacingly huge. He
          glares at Ray and roars:

          Who the fuck are you???-
          Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the
          guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead.

          Sir, my name is Ray Kinsella, and it's
          a great pleasure 'Co finally ---
          The door slams in his face. It takes Ray a few seconds to
          realize the interview is over.
          He rings the bell again. The door opens. Mann°s large
          frame fills it.

                         (TALKS FAST)
          Mr. Mann, I've come 1500 miles to see
          you at the risk of losing my home and
          alienating my wife. If I could just
          have a minute. Please.

                         MANN
          Look. I can't tell you the secret of
          life, and I don't have any answers for
          you. I don't give interviews, I am no
          longer a public figure, I just want to
          be left alone. So fuck off.

                         RAY
          Just one minute. I'm begging you.
          Mann looks him over. Then he sighs.

                         MANN
          One minute.
          Mann turns and enters the storefront. Ray follows.

          85 INT. MANN'S STOREFRONT

          It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable.
          There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and
          a postage scale. A few workbenches have software and
          spread sheets strewn across them. In the back are a couple
          of personal computers.
          On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos
          in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther
          King...with Bob Dylan...with Timothy Leary...rann being
          arrested at some demonstration.. .Mann at Woodstock...
          Mann's gruff voice pulls Ray's attention away from these
          relics.

                         MANN
          Your minute ain't getting bigger.

                         RAY
          Okay. I understand your desire for
          privacy, and i wouldn't dream of
          intruding if this weren't extremely
          important.

                         MANN

          Mann picks up an old-fashioned bug sprayer -- the kind with
          a long arm that pumps in and out -- and starts spraying it
          at Ray as if he were an unwanted insect.

                         MANN

          He is backing Ray out the door.

          future! Get back while you still can!
          He gets Ray just past the door and slams it shut.
          Ray slams it open. He's pissed.

                         RAY

          Mann stops fuming and considers that. He sighs, sadly.

          Yes. I suppose I have. How's this?
          (smiles and makes
          the peace sign)
          'Peace, love, dope.'

                         (ROARS)
          Now get the fuck out of here!!!
          And he slams the door shut again. Ray is flabbergasted.
          He is thinking furiously. Then he notices that in slamming
          the door, the latch has not locked in place. He thinks,
          makes up his mind, and quietly opens the door.
          Mann has returned to work, his back to the door.
          Ray enters the loft, his left hand in his jacket pocket.
          When he is halfway across the loft, he clears his throat.
          Mann spins around.

                         MANN
          Now you've pissed me off.

                         RAY
          Okay, hold it right there.
          He juts his pocketed hand forward, as if he had a gun in
          his jacket.

                         RAY

          this way...

          Yeah? Let me see it.

                         RAY
          Get out of here, I'm not going to show
          you my gun.

          little while, then -- what are you
          doing?
          Mann has found a crowbar among his tools, and is advancing
          toward Ray.

                         MANN
          I'm going to beat you with a crowbar
          till you go away.
          Understandably, this makes Ray nervous.

                         RAY
          Whoa! Wait! You can't do that.

          Mann is almost to him, now, the crowbar raised above his
          head.

                         RAY
          You're a pacifist!
          Mann stops. He thinks. He lowers the crowbar.

                         MANN
          Shit.
          Ray breathes a sigh of relief.

          playing at Ebbets Field, and how sad you

          hand, while his left hand remains in his pocket,
          substituting for a gun.

          don't say anything to this guy, okay?
          I swear to God there's a reason we're
          supposed to be at this game.
          Mann gives him a "Give me a break" look.
          Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and
          walking towards them. Ray is desperate.

                         RAY
          If I get arrested, the press'll be all
          over you, you'll have to appear in open
          court, you'll be the lead story on
          Entertainment Tonight, and your
          picture'll be on the front page of every
          tabloid in America.
          The Policeman knocks on Ray's window. He is young,
          fresh-scrubbed and earnest. Ray holds up one hand to him.

                         RAY
          Just a second.

          Mann's eyes narrow. The cop knocks again, more
          insistently. Ray rolls down-the window."

          License and registration.
          Nervously, Ray complies. Mann turns his face toward the
          passenger side window. Ray's mouth dries up. He has no
          idea what Mann will do.
          The Policeman scrutinizes the license, turns it over to
          look for convictions, and checks Ray's face against the
          felonlike photo. Then he looks at Mann.

                         POLICEMAN
          And what's your name,-sir?
          Mann keeps his face averted.

                         MANN
          Terry.

                         POLICEMAN
          Where is it that you and Raymond are
          going, Terry?

                         RAY
          Fenway Park! We're going to the ball

          (turns to cop)
          Actually, Officer, I'm being kidnapped.
          Discreetly, under his breath, Ray sings the "Entertainment
          Tonight" theme song.

                         RAY
          'Entertainment Tonight,

          Mann winces. The officer looks at him questioningly.

          MANN,
          What I mean by that is, I don't care
          much for baseball, but Raymond insisted.

                         POLICEMAN
          Yeah, I hate baseball.

          Sourly, Mann nods. Ray smiles and drives off.

          And thank you.

                         MANN
          I didn't do it just because I don't want
          the publicity.

          Nope. I live on a farm in Iowa. One
          day, out in the cornfield, I heard a
          voice...

          Ray slides the Datsun into a parking place, and he and Mann
          walk the short sleazy block to Fenway, and old-fashioned
          center-city ballpark.

          Ray and Mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the
          aisle toward the field.

                         RAY
          God, this place is so beautiful.
          The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking
          around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or
          thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice;
          a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage
          as one player hits to several others in the field. A few
          sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts.
          Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red
          Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.

                         RAY
          It could be 1912 out there, for all this
          place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on
          that very mound as a pitcher long before
          anyone knew he could hit home runs.
          Same mound.

          The game is in progress. Ray and Mann are in their fifth
          row seats. They do not speak.
          At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that
          something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just
          watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard.

                         94 THE SCOREBOARD 94
          Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes
          pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant
          replays of some of the action.

                         94
          Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing
          message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the
          crowd fade out.
          There is only the message:

                         LIFETIME STATISTICS:

          The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks
          almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike
          anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard.

          95 RAY AND MANN

                         95
          Ray looks around him. The sounds of the game return, and
          from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he
          realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens
          his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this,
          but cannot see what Ray is writing.
          Then Ray hears The Voice.

                         THE VOICE

          attitude.

          Then let's go.
          Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the
          program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham,
          who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get
          to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark.

          You'll think I'm crazy.

                         MANN
          I already think you're crazy. What did

          After a little thought, Ray smiles sadly.

                         RAY
          It said 'The man's done enough. Leave
          him alone.'
          Ray puts the car in gear, makes a wide turn, and starts to
          head back up the street. But he stops short when Mann's
          form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the
          headlights..
          Ray does not know why Mann is blocking his path. Or why
          he appears tense, almost frightened.

                         MANN
          'Moonlight' Graham.
          Ray's jaw drops.

          New York Giants, 1922. He played one
          game, never got to bat.

          Near Chisholm, the land is getting ever weirder. It looks
          like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs. It has
          been split and gutted; greenery has grown back, but at

          The woman Manager of the motel is having a'cup of coffee
          with Ray.

                         MOTEL MANAGER
          You know, everybody's talking about you
          two. Our neighbors came over last night
          and we just told Doc'Graham stories
          until after midnight. I even wrote some
          of them down.
          She takes out a piece of paper.

                         RAY
          That's very nice of you.

                         MOTEL MANAGER
          Well, it's funny. It's like all these
          memories we have of Doc had gone to
          sleep and sunk way down inside us. But
          once you started asking about him, and
          started us talking about him, why they
          swum back up to the surface again.
          Ray smiles.

          Ray walks by the old movie theatre, which sits at the edge
          of a residential street. The Godfather is playing. He
          nods at an elderly man who passes him on the street. He
          passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some
          kind in its unlit front window. He takes another two or
          three steps before he has, to stop to take a better look at
          the sign.

          It takes a second to make out the image in the dark, but
          it is a head shot of Richard Nixon. Above, it says "Four
          More Years". Below, it reads "Re-Elect The President".

                         114 RAY

          1.14
          is puzzled. He turns and looks at the theatre marquee.

          115 THE THEATRE MARQUEE

                          115
           Under the letters that spell out "The Godfather", are
           smaller letters that read "Nominated for 10 Academy
           Awards".

                         116 RAY

                         116
          frowns. He says the word to himself.

                         RAY
          Nominated?
          Ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him.

                         117 THE CAR

           : . 17
           It is an old Mustang. The annual tag on the license plate
           reads: 1972.

          All the cars on the street are pre-1972. And still walking
          down the block away from him, is the elderly man Ray passed
          moments earlier.
          The man is about sixty-five years old, stooped a little,
          but the body is still lithe, an athlete's body. He is
          wearing a dark overcoat...

          The little hairs on the back of Ray's neck stand up. His
          mouth is dry, and for a moment, he cannot speak. Then, he
          calls to the man.

                         RAY
          Doctor Graham?
          Slowly, the man stops and turns back to face Ray. Ray
          starts to trot to him.

                         ELDERLY MAN
          Who's that?

                         RAY
          My name is Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa.
          Are you Moonlight Graham?
          The old man narrows his bright eyes to see Ray more
          clearly.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          No one's called me 'Moonlight' Graham
          for fifty years.

                         RAY
          Well, I've come...

          Funny. I couldn't sleep tonight.
          Usually, I sleep like a baby. So I told
          Alicia I was going to take a walk.

                         RAY
          Mind if i join you? I'd like to talk
          to you.
          Doc nods and they start to walk.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Let's go to the high school. We can sit
          in my office. What do. you want to talk
          about?

                         RAY
          Well, first of all, how'd you get to be
          called 'Moonlight'?

                         DOC GRAHAM
          'Cause of a night like this, long ago.
          I'd just gotten to the minors, and I
          went out to the ballpark.

          ballpark at night. Like a church.

                         RAY
          Yeah, I know what you mean.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Anyway, I fell asleep. Next morning,
          they found me in the on-deck circle, all
          curled up like a baby. Someone called
          me 'Moonlight,' and it stuck.

          122 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL 122

          Doc fumbles out a key, and lets them in.

                         RAY
          When you got to the majors, you played
          only one inning of one game. What
          happened in that inning?

          123 INT. HIGH SCHOOL 123

          They enter the hallway of the old school, the smell of
          varnish and chalk almost palpable.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          It was the last day of the season.
          Bottom of the eighth, and we were way
          ahead. I'd been up with the club for
          most of a month, but hadn't seen any
          action. Just then old John McGraw
          points a bony finger at me and says
          'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up
          like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed
          my glove, and ran out onto the field.
          They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and
          enter. Doc Graham's office.

          124 INT.,DOC GRAHAM'S OFFICE 124

          Doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk, and motions Ray
          to the black-leather sofa a few feet away.

                         RAY
          Did you get to make a play?
          Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an
          inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins
          chewing.

          the infield.
          Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little
          spitball towards him.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Heads up.
          It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs
          there, like a white fly.

                         RAY
          I was warned about you.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Anyway, one inning later the game was
          over, and so was I.

                         RAY
          And what was that like?

                         DOC GRAHAM
          It was like coming this close to your
          dreams, and then watching them brush
          past you like a stranger in a crowd.
          Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on
          his face. He looks out the window, focused on faraway.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Except, at the time, you don't think
          much of it. Hardly anybody recognizes
          the most significant moment of their
          life when they're happening. Back then
          I just figured there'd be plenty more
          days. I didn't know that would be the
          only one.
          Doc Graham notices that Ray is looking very serious.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Now, let me ask you a question, Ray
          Kinsella. What makes that half-inning
          so interesting that you come all the way
          from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five

          I didn't really know till just now. But
          I think it's to ask you if you could do
          anything you wanted to...if you could
          have a wish...

                         DOC GRAHAM

          Doc nods. his understanding. He smiles wryly, takes a new
          piece of paper, and bites off a little section.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          And are you the kind of man who could
          grant me that wish?

          I don't know. I'm just asking...
          Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead
          thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that
          could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the
          Polo Grounds in New York.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          I never got to bat in the major leagues.
          I'd have liked the chance -- just once
          -- to stare down a big league pitcher.
          Stare him down and then just as he goes
          into the windup -- wink! Make him
          wonder if I know something he doesn't.
          That's what I wish for. The chance to
          squint my eyes when the sky is so blue
          it hurts to look at it, and to feel the
          'tingle that runs up your arms when you
          connect dead-on. The chance to run the
          bases, stretch a double to a triple, and
          flop race-first into third, wrapping my
          arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray
          Kinsella... that's my wish.
          Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Is there enough magic floating around
          in the night out there for you to make
          that wish come true?

          happen. And if you want to go there,
          I can take you.
          Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed
          smile as he wipes away a tear.

          This is my most special place in the
          world, Ray. Once a place touches you
          like this, the wind never blows so cold
          again. You feel for it like it was your
          child. I can't leave here.
          Ray cannot believe the man won't leave Chisholm for his
          dream.

          It'll stay one. I was born here, lived
          here, and I'll die here. That's okay.
          I'll have no regrets.

          for five minutes. .now that would have
          been a tragedy.

          It is later that same night, and Ray has been recounting
          his experience with Doc Graham to Mann, who appears quietly
          troubled.

                         RAY
          And then I figured maybe we're not
          supposed to take him with us. So now
          I don't know why the hell we were
          supposed to come here.

                         MANN
          Maybe it was to find out if one inning
          can change the world.

          Did it?

          Annie is asleep. The phone rings, and the speed with which
          she picks it up suggests that her anxiety to get this phone
          call prevented her from sleeping very deeply.

          just sold the note on the farm to Mark
          and his partners. So they own the
          paper now, and he says if we don't sell
          to them, they'll foreclose. Ray, we
          don't have the money.

          As they turn onto the highway near the lake, a Teenager
          with a dufflebag appears on the side of the road, his arm

          Ray and Mann exchange brief smiles.

                         TEENAGER
          I'm looking for a place to play, and I
          heard that all through the Midwest,
          towns have teams, and in some places
          they'll find you a day job so you can
          play ball nights and weekends.

          This is your lucky day, kid. We're

          Don't. He didn't get it till he was in
          the minors.

                         MANN
          Maybe we can give it to him.

                         RAY
          Funny, the way he described towns,
          finding you a job so you can play on
          their team...they haven't done that for
          years. My Dad did that for a while.
          But that was in the Twenties.

                         MANN
          What happened to your father?

                         RAY
          He never made it as ball player, so he
          tried to get his son to make it for him.
          By the time I was ten, playing baseball
          got to be like eating vegetables or
          taking out the garbage, so when I was
          fourteen, I started to refuse. Can you
          believe that? An American boy refusing
          to have a catch with his father.

          I know. Anyway, when I was seventeen,
          we had a big fight, I packed my things,
          said something awful, and left. After
          a while I wanted to come home, but I
          didn't know how. I made it back for the
          funeral.

          Ray turns the Datsun into the long driveway and, with a
          rumble, crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock
          from escaping to the roadway.
          He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as
          the three men unfold themselves from the car, Karin bolts
          from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and
          pink pedal pushers. She flings herself into Ray's arms,
          and hugs his neck in unrestrained joy.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          With a couple of Cardinals and A's
          thrown in for good measure. Ty Cobb
          wanted to play, but none of us could
          stand the sonofabitch when we were
          alive, so we told him to stuff it.

                         (TO ARCHIE)
          Hey, are you Graham?

                         ARCHIE
          Yes sir.
          Ray and Mann are astonished that Shoeless Joe knows who
          Archie is.

          Archie quickly scampers down the bleachers, onto the field,
          shakes Joe's hand, and runs to the dugout.

          The White Sox are in the field, the Giants at bat. A Giant
          hitter bunts, and the runner on second takes third despite
          a close throw.
          Mann, Ray, Karin and Annie are in the stands, Mann keeping
          score.

                         MANN

          Um, no. The batter was trying to
          sacrifice.

                         RAY
          So how do you score it?

                         KARIN
          Fielder's choice?

                         RAY

          Mann is impressed. He lifts Karin up from her seat on the
          row below them, and places her next to him to help him.

                         MANN
          You better sit here.
          Karin beams. Ray taps Mann and points to the plate.

                         RAY
          Look.
          Archie Graham -- now wearing a Giant's uniform -- drops one
          of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle,
          and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a
          brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream. He plants
          himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top
          end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and
          waits for the pitch.'
          The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back.
          As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him.
          There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the
          pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it
          is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way
          and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his
          mask.

                         CATCHER
          Good thing for you that wasn't his
          fastball.
          Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a
          little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of
          determination.

                         ARCHIE
          Come on, let's see your fastball.
          The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And
          right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the
          way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately
          appeals to the Umpire.

                         ARCHIE °
          Hey, ump, how about a warning?

                         UMPIRE
          Sure. Watch out-you don't get killed.
          Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to
          call time, and steps out of the batter's box. The on-deck
          batter, Mel Ott, comes over.

          going to be?

                         ARCHIE
          Either-low and away, or in my ear.

                         OTT
          He don't want to load the bases. Look
          for low and away.
          Archie nods and starts to walk back to the plate.

                         OTT
          But watch out for 'in your ear.'
          Archie takes his place in the batter's box again. He still
          looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch
          is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him.
          But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and
          away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it.
          The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center
          fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to
          his left, and makes the catch.
          Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores.
          As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline
          to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering.
          In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him
          a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his
          cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation.

                         (LAUGHS)

          But when Archie gets to the bench, he can't contain himself
          anymore. He leaps up and lets out a cheer of pure joy.

          than he's saying.

          Ray, it's time'to put away our little
          fantasies and come down to earth.

                         RAY
          It's not a fantasy, Mark. They're real.
          Mark obviously do.esn't see anyone on the field.

          Shoeless Joe Jackson. The White Sox.
          The Giants.

                         MARK
          And who's that? Babe Ruth?
          Ray smiles, savoring the moment.

                         RAY
          As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.

                         MARK
          Ah, how do you? I'm Michael Jackson.

                         (TO RAY)
          Ray, we have to settle this thing right
          now.

                         RAY
          I'm not selling you my home.

                         MARK
          You have no money, you've got a stack
          of bills to choke a pig, and come fall,
          you've got no crop to sell. But I have
          a deal to offer you that will allow you
          to stay on this land.
          This has Ray's attention. Mark climbs the bleachers to
          stand closer to him.

                         KARIN
          Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.
          But no one pays her any attention. All eyes are on Mark.

          Then you must realize we cannot keep a
          useless baseball diamond in the middle
          of rich farmland.

          No deal, Mark. We're staying.

          really boring, so they'll take a drive.
          And they'll drive down our road, and
          they'll see the lights and they'll think
          it's really pretty.

          children, longing for the past. 'Of
          course we won't mind if you look
          around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty
          dollars per person.' And they'll pass
          over the money without even looking at
          it. For it is money they have, and

          turns back to Mark. It's decision time.

          directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him
          toward the house.

          142 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW - CARS 142
          have parked in front of the house. More are coming quietly
          down the driveway. Dozens of cars. Cars with out-of-state
          license plates.
          Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait
          patiently. One or two families sit on their hoods, or have
          set up picnic dinners on their station wagons' tailgates.

          Her hot dog flies off, the bun and wiener separating in
          midair. One small sandal bounces end over end and lands
          at the foot of the bleacher. It takes forever for her body
          to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards
          of one of the bottom rows.

          fence, staring silently.

                         MANN
          How long?

                         RA Y
          Its a twenty-minute drive.
          Mann winces. He knows that could be fatal. Ray kneels by
          Karin. Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped
          by the fall. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across
          her cheek and down her neck. She is becoming bluer and her
          cough is faint, as though she is in another room.

          Mark takes off his $300 pale-green velvet corduroy jacket
          and is wordlessly holding it out to Ray. Ray takes the
          jacket and covers Karin gently.
          Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more
          strained and distant.

                         RAY
          Karin...
          Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field.
          The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay
          around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham.

                         148 ARCHIE GRAHAM

                         148
          has noticed the'commotion in the bleachers, and he starts
          to lope across the field.

                         149 BLEACHERS

                         149
          Annie has pulled the car over and honks. Ray holds up his
          hand to her to wait. His eyes are on young Archie Graham.

          150 YOUNG ARCHIE GRAHAM

           3.50
           As Graham gets closer, his features begin to change, and
           his step slows. He reaches the end of the fence -- around
           which no player can pass
          -- and when he emerges from the
          shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young
          Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago...but Doc
          Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota. His baseball
          glove has turned into a black doctor's bag.

                         151 THE BLEACHERS

                         151
          as Doc Graham approaches.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          What have we got here?

                         RAY
          She fell.
          Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          This child's choking to death.

          He picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the
          other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and
          turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand,
          he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder
          blades with the heel of his other hand.
          Annie honks again. Ray waves her to him. Mark cannot
          believe what he is seeing.
          Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air.
          Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a
          sizable piece of hog dog and bun.
          As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing
          from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc
          peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a
          few seconds, and lets the eye close.

                         DCC GRAHAM
          She's okay. I don't think the fall
          really hurt her, just the dog in her
          throat. She'll be coming around in a
          minute or two.

                         RAY

                         (SIGHS DEEPLY)
          Thank you, Doc.
          Doc looks deeply into Ray's eyes.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          No, son. Thank you.
          It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed
          to save the child. Ray looks to the field, and then back
          at the Doctor.

                         RAY
          'Oh, my God, you can't go back.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          It's okay...

                         (NODS KNOWINGLY)
          It's okay.

          152 MARK AND ANNIE

                         152
          Mark is slack-jawed. He has seen something magical happen
          and cannot explain it.

                         MARK

          There's hope for you yet, Mark.

          153 RAY AND DOC GRAHAM

                         153
          Doc Graham stands, and picks up his black bag.

                         DOC GRAHAM
          Well, I best be getting back home before
          Alicia starts to thinking I've got a
          girlfriend.
          He walks around the edge of the fence, and heads for the
          outfield door. The players respectfully make way for him.

                         HAPPY FELSCH
          Good work, Doc.

                         EDDIE CICOTTE

          will you?
          He passes them.

          Hev rookie!
          Doc Graham turns.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          You were good.
          Only now do Doc Graham's eyes shine with tears. He smiles,
          and disappears through the door.

          Karin is coming to, Ray and Annie by her side. Some of the
          players start to gather up their equipment. Shoeless Joe
          calls to Ray.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          We're gonna call it a night. We'll see

           Joe starts to trot off the field, then he stops and turns
           back to the bleachers.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Hey! You wanna come with us?
          Ray's jaw drops.

          Shoeless Joe and the other players wait for Mann to join
          them, ignoring Ray's question.

          (smiles and nods)
          'Go the distance.'
          When he says those words, Shoeless Joe sounds just like The
          Voice.

                         RAY
          It was you.

                         159 SHOELESS JOE

                          159

                          SHOELESS JOE
           No, Ray. It was you.
           Shoeless joe winks and walks away, disappearing through the
           door in the outfield fence.

          160 RAY AND ANNIE

                         160
          The Catcher is halfway across the field. Ray turns to
          Annie. He cannot even swallow.

                         RAY
          My God, I only saw him later, when he
          was worn down by life. Look at him.
          The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass. Ray
          walks down to the edge of the outfield.

                         CONTINUED

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         114

                         160 CONTINUED

                          160

                          RAY
          He has his whole life in front of him,
          and I'm not even a glint in his eye.
          What do I say to him?

                         ANNIE
          Introduce him to his granddaughter.
          Ray cannot believe how wonderful Annie is. The Catcher has
          reached the edge of the field, and now stands before Ray
          and Annie.

                         CATCHER
          Hi, I just wanted to thank you folks for
          putting up the field and letting us play
          here. I'm John Kinsella.
          They shake his hand.

                         RAY
          I'm Ray. My wife Annie. And this is
          my daughter, Karin.

                         (TO KARIN)
          Karin, this is...
          He almost says "My father."

                         RAY

                         KARIN

                         JOHN
          Ray and Annie are beaming. Annie takes Karin's hand.

                         ANNIE
          We're going to let you two talk. I have
          to go look after our guests. Someone's
          gotta start collecting admission if
          we're going to keep this place.
          (to the Catcher)
          Very nice meeting you.

                         JOHN
          M' am.

                         161 ANNIE

                         161
          hoists Karin up and totes her toward the tourists waiting
          in front of the house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         115

          162 RAY AND JOHN

                         162
          watch them for a while, then start to,stroll across the
          field.

                         RAY
          You catch a good game.

                         JOHN
          Thank you. It's so beautiful here. Its
          like-well for me, it's like a dream
          come true.
          Ray cannot speak. He nods.

                         JOHN
          Can I ask you something?
          Again, Ray nods.

                         JOHN
          Is this heaven?
          Ray smiles and shakes his head no.

                         RAY
          It's Iowa.

                         JOHN
          Iowa. I could've sworn this was heaven.

                         163 RAY

                         16 3
          stops and looks intently at John. He asks this question
          as if he were asking the secret of life. Maybe he is.

                         RAY
          Is there a heaven?

                         164 JOHN

                         164
          takes time to answer that. He looks up at the night sky
          and searches it.

                         JOHN
          Oh, yeah...
          Then he looks square into Ray's eyes.

                         JOHN
          Heaven's where dreams come true.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         116

                         165 RAY

                         165
          looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on
          the veranda, a moon bright as butter silvering the night
          above them. He smiles. He finally understands. He turns
          back to John and nods.

                         RAY
          Then maybe this is heaven.

                         166 JOHN

                         166
          smiles wisely in return.

                         JOHN
          Well...good night, Ray.

                         RAY
          Good night.

                         167 MASTER

                         167
          John starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield
          fence.

                         RAY
          Hey!
          John turns back. Ray is holding a ball.

                         RAY
          You wanna have a catch?
          John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them;
          there is the hint of moisture. Does he know Ray is his
          son?

                         JOHN
          I'd like that.

          Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and
          puts it on.

          They throw the ball back and forth.

          And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son
          bathed by white floodlights and car headlights... on the
          silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of
          a cornfield.

                         FADE OUT

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY

	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

	CREDITS  ROLL

	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913

	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY

	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

						PROFESSOR
					(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

						PROFESSOR
				"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

						BILLY
				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

						PROFESSOR
				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

						PROFESSOR
				Every five thousand years..

						BILLY
					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

						PRIEST
				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

						PROFESSOR
				"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.

						PROFESSOR
				"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

						PROFESSOR
				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

						PRIEST
				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

						PROFESSOR
				"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

						PRIEST (V.O.)
				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

						PROFESSOR
				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

						PRIEST
				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

						PROFESSOR
				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

						PROFESSOR
				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

						PROFESSOR
				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

						PROFESSOR
				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

						PRIEST
				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

						PRIEST
				Drink!

						PROFESSOR
				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

						PROFESSOR
				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

						PROFESSOR
				"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

						PROFESSOR
				Where is that boy? Billy!

7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor reads the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

						PROFESSOR
					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						PROFESSOR
				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

						PROFESSOR
					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						PRIEST
				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						PROFESSOR
					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

9	INT.  TUNNEL

	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM

	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						KOMMANDER
				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

						PRIEST
					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

						KOMMANDER
				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY

	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						PRIEST
					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						KOMMANDER
				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

						PRIEST
				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

						KOMMANDER
				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

						KOMMANDER
				When EVIL returns so shall we.

						PRIEST
					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						BILLY
				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						PRIEST
				No!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

						CLERK
				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						KOMMANDER
				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						KOMMANDER
				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY

	The huge ship's main hatch closes.

17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS

	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT

	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER

	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM

	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

						STAEDERT
				Don't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

						CAPTAIN
				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

						TECHNICIAN
				It's taking shape.

21	EXT.  SPACE

	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

						CAPTAIN
					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

						TECHNICIAN
				Hook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.

						STAEDERT
				...Send out a probe.

22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN

	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

						AIDE
				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						CAPTAIN
				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				Staedert, do you read me?

						STAEDERT
				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

						STAEDERT
				Perfect, Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

						STAEDERT
				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						PRESIDENT
				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.

						STAEDERT
				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						PRESIDENT
				Options.

						STAEDERT
				Wait or act.

						PRESIDENT
				Recommendations.

						STAEDERT
				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.

						PRESIDENT
				Gentlemen?

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				So do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod "yes"

						PRESIDENT
				All right, then! Staedert?

						PRIEST (O.S.)
				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						PRESIDENT
				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

						PRIEST
				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I'm listening.

						CORNELIUS
				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

						PRESIDENT
					(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

						CORNELIUS
				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

24	INT.  SPACESHIP

						TECHNICIAN
				The probe will attain its objective in
				five seconds.

	Staedert moves closer to the ship's window.

25	EXT.  SPACE.

	Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.

26	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						STAEDERT
				Mr. President, we're at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.

						PRESIDENT
				Your theory is interesting Father but
				I don't think we have time to go into it
				right now!

						CORNELIUS
				Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				That's exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
				fellow citizens! General?
				You may fire when ready.

				Marker lights on the objective.

28	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.

29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					(consulting new data)
				Its structure has just solidified on the surface,
				 as if the object felt something.  If that's the case,
				we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

						CORNELIUS
				The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.

						CAPTAIN
				...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.

						PRESIDENT
					(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.

						STAEDERT
					(cold)
				I don't, Mr. President.

30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Staedert looks worried.

						STAEDERT
				Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
				shield protection.

						CAPTAIN
				Yes, Sir.

	The President is growing ever more worried.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you
				destroy it?

						STAEDERT
				I'm about to, Mr. President.

32	EXT.  SPACESHIP

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

						SCIENTIST
				The planet's diameter has greatly
				increased and it's moving toward the ship.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?

						STAEDERT
					(worried)
				...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

						CAPTAIN
				Nothing, General.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

						STAEDERT
					(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

33	INT.  APARTMENT

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						KORBEN
					(on the phone)
				Yeah?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

						KORBEN

					(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

						FINGER (V.O.)
				I love you too Major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.

						KORBEN
				I was talking to the cat.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

						KORBEN
				At least, the cat comes back.

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(ironical)
				You still pining for that two timing bitch.
				Forget her.
				There are a million women out there.

						KORBEN
				I don't want a million - I just want
				one.  A perfect one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Don't exist bud.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						KORBEN
				I just found a picture of you.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How do I look?

						KORBEN
				Like shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:
	WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				 Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.

						KORBEN
					(sighs)
				I don't need one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				I know how you drive.

						KORBEN
				Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a
				space fighter!!

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How many points you got left on your
				license?

						KORBEN
					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

						KORBEN

						CORNELIUS
					(to the President)
				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the
				Federated Territories, but they are peaceful...
				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

						CORNELIUS
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						PRESIDENT
				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

						CORNELIUS
				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

	The President's nerves quiver.

						CAPTAIN
				Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at
				the frontier requesting permission to enter
				 our territory.

						PRESIDENT
				I guess I should make a decision..

						CORNELIUS
				They are the only ones who can help..

						GENERAL
				Sir..the Mondoshawan do not belong to the
				federation. We do not know their intention..
				I must recommend a full trinuclear assault..

						PRESIDENT
					(yells)
				Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship
				like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is!
				I ask you for options you give me bullshit.

	Korben is about to exit the apartment.

						KORBEN
				Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your
				mind. Bye sweetie..

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge
	gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face.

						MUGGER
				The cash man!

						KORBEN
				Been here long?

						MUGGER
				Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow
				you into tomorrow!

	Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.

						KORBEN
				Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.
				Neuro charged assault model?

						MUGGER
					(off balance)
				Uh..

						KORBEN
				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

						MUGGER
				It's not?

						KORBEN
				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

						MUGGER
				Thanks..

						KORBEN
				You're welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

						KORBEN
				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches
a nuclear holocaust on T.V.,  uninterrupted.

	An arm, on a surgical cart, moves down the hall of the Nucleological
Center, the most sterile of environments.

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

						MUNRO
				This is all that survived?

						MACTILBURGH
				Actually only one cell survived..

						MUNRO
				Have you identified it?

						MACTILBURGH
				It's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

						MUNRO
				Talk English Doc.

						MACTILBURGH
				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

						MUNRO
				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						MACTILBURGH
				Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

						MACTILBURGH
					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

						MACTILBURGH
				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

						MUNRO
				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

						DOCTOR
				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

						MACTILBURGH
					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

						MUNRO
					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

						ASSISTANT
				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

						MACTILBURGH
					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

						ASSISTANT
				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

						MACTILBURGH
				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

						MACTILBURGH
					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

						MUNRO
				...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

						GIRL
					(very angry)
				Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra
				mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla.
				Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa!
				Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What's she saying?

						MACTILBURGH
					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

						MACTILBURGH
				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

						MUNRO
					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

						MACTILBURGH
					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

						GIRL
					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

						MUNRO
					(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

						CHIEF
				Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you
				go through the main ventilation!

55	INT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORY

	The girl moves along unable to see what's ahead of her. She comes to a

the ledge.

56	EXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWN

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						CHIEF
					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

						COP
				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our
				instructions!

	The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.

57	INT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHT

						COP
					(in the car.)
				Christ! She dove off!

	In a panic, the COP makes a wrong turn.  The girl falls for several
seconds.
	She lands on the roof of a flying cab.

58	INT.  CAB - NIGHT

	Korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				You have just had an accident.
				Seven points have been temporarily
				removed...

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						VOICE / KORBEN
				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

						GIRL
				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

						KORBEN
					(lost)
				...'Scuse me?

	A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

						COP
					(over a loudspeaker)
				You have an unauthorized passenger in your
				vehicle.  We are going to arrest her.
				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

						KORBEN
					(obeying)
				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

						GIRL
					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can't resist her plea.

						KORBEN
				Don't put me in this position...
				I can't... I'm late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

						KORBEN
				Finger's gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						KORBEN
				I hate when people cry...
				I got no defense...

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAY

	Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. Except the
dead-end he's just come up against.

						GIRL
				Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

						KORBEN
				It there's one thing I don't need advice on,
				it's how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

						COP
				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET

	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

						KORBEN
				We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				...Priest...

						KORBEN
				You're not that bad... Come on we'll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

						KORBEN
				Vito Cornelius?

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

61	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door opens. Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms.

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

				Weddings are one floor down.
				Congratulations.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				She's not my bride, she's my fare.
				She's looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

						CORNELIUS
					(curious)
				That's me.  But I don't know who she is...
				where did you find her?

						KORBEN
				She dropped in on me... holding this.

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

						CORNELIUS

				The fifth element.

	He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks
around helpless.

						KORBEN

	In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

						CORNELIUS

						CORNELIUS
				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

						KORBEN
				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

						CORNELIUS
					(eyes riveted on her)
				He's a she!

				There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

						KORBEN
				So you do know her.

						CORNELIUS
				Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						KORBEN
				Perfect...

63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

						CORNELIUS
				It's a miracle!!!

						DAVID
					(worried)
				What is?

						CORNELIUS
					(babbling crazily)
				I can't wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT

	Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

						GIRL
					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				I'm sorry, it's just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

						KORBEN
				You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven't been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll
				need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

						DAVID
				Father, will you please explain what's
				going on?

						CORNELIUS
				The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,

66	INT.  LIVING ROOM

						KORBEN
				...What's your name?

						GIRL
					(after a moment)
				Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
				Ekbat De Sebat.

						KORBEN
					(polite)
				Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

						GIRL
				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

						KORBEN
				That's... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

						CORNELIUS
				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

						LEELOO
				Corn-i-Lius?

						CORNELIUS
					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

						DAVID
				Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

						CORNELIUS
				Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

						KORBEN
				They all like this in your family, father?

						CORNELIUS
				She's an exception..

						CORNELIUS
				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

						KORBEN
				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

						KORBEN
				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she's better?

						CORNELIUS
				She's fine, really..don't you worry..
				just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

						KORBEN
				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

						CORNELIUS
				It means, "Never without my permission".

						KORBEN
				That's what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

						KORBEN
				...Thanks.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

66B	INT.. KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in
the air.

						KORBEN
				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

						KORBEN
				Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way
				over but I had a fare fall into my lap..
				y'know one of those big fares you just
				can't resist..

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(suspicious)
				So, just how big was this fare?

						KORBEN
				5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin...

	Korben takes out a cigarette.

68	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

						DAVID
				What's she doing?

						CORNELIUS
				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She's been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						CORNELIUS
				What're you laughing about?

						LEELOO
					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						DAVID
					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						CORNELIUS
					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

						LEELOO
				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

						CORNELIUS
				The case was stolen?

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

	CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

						RIGHT ARM
				Excuse me sir, the council is worried about
				the economy heating up.  They wondered if
				it would be possible to fire 500...

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

						ZORG
				Fire 1000.

						RIGHT ARM
				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						RIGHT ARM
				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

	... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						CORNELIUS
				There was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art
				dealer ... Asking all these questions about
				the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think
				anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so
				bad with names...

						DAVID
					(to Leeloo, timid)
				I didn't know your size.

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

						DAVID
				They really made her...

						CORNELIUS
				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

						LEELOO
					(to David)
				Domo danko!

	David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo?  The Stones...
				We must get them back.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						LEELOO
				Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

						CORNELIUS
				You know exactly where they are!

71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

						ZORG
					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

						ZORG
				...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

						ZORG
				That's better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You're warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

						ZORG
				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

						ZORG
					(very fast)
				...It's light... the handle's adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

						ZORG
				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it's even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

						ZORG
				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

						ZORG
					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

						ZORG
				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT's hands.

						ZORG
				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

						ZORG
				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

72	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

						CORNELIUS
					(astonished)
				What do you mean empty?

73	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

						ZORG
				Alright..I've got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

74	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

						CORNELIUS
					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She's supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She's looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

						LEELOO
				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

						DAVID
				Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation

	Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

						CORNELIUS
				...We're saved!

75	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

						ZORG
				I'm fucked!

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						AKNOT
				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

						ZORG
					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT's men grow edgy.

						AKNOT
					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

						ZORG
					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

						ZORG
				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
				ZERO CRATES!!!
					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we're outta here.

	AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

						AKNOT
					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

76	EXT.  OUTSIDE  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.

						ZORG
				I don't like warriors!  They're too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.
				Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when
				he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.

77	INT.  HALLWAY  ZORG'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

	The warriors have all taken a weapon. One of them inspects his ZF1.  He
turns it over and notices the little red button. He presses it.

	Korben is finishing a Thai meal, cooked by a Thai on his mini restaurant
anchored at the window. The cat eats next to Korben, contented.

						KORBEN
				So you forgive me?

	The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  Korben ignores it.

						THAI
				Not going to open?

						KORBEN
				I've never gotten a message that wasn't
				bad news.

						THAI
				How someone strong like you scared from
				a message? Is good news I sure!

						KORBEN
				The last two messages I got?  The first one
				was from my wife telling me she was leaving!
				And the second was from my lawyer telling me
				he was leaving too... with my wife.

						THAI
				You right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				Grandfather say: "It never rain every day."
				This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

	Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						THAI
				...You're fired. Oh!

	Korben smiles at him.

						KORBEN
				At least I won lunch.

						THAI
				Good philosophy..see good in bad..
				I like..I prepare number one dessert..
				special for you and pussy..

	The cat meows.

						CORNELIUS
				Good work, my son.  Now all we need is

	The doorbell rings.

				I'll get it.  Finish your work my son.

	Cornelius opens to Right Arm with armed escort.

						ZORG
				Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...
				nice to see you again

						CORNELIUS
				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						ZORG
				I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you're going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

						CORNELIUS
				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

						ZORG
				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

						CORNELIUS
				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

						ZORG
				Why?  What's wrong with me?

						CORNELIUS
				...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

						ZORG
				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

						ZORG
				...would you like a drink?

						CORNELIUS
				No thank you.

						ZORG
				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						ZORG
				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

						ZORG
				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						ZORG
				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

						CORNELIUS
				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						ZORG
				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

						ZORG
				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

						CORNELIUS
				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						ZORG
				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

						CORNELIUS
					(mocking)
				Where's the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

						CORNELIUS
				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

						ZORG
				You saved my life... So, I'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

						CORNELIUS
				You are a monster, Zorg!

						ZORG
					(complimented)
				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

						ZORG
				...Torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but I want
				those Stones. You have an hour.

phone rings.

				Saved by the bell.

	Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

				You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in

				Hi Ma...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You wouldn't even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				Know something? The whole thing makes

	The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second
match..

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

						KORBEN
					(to the Thai)
				Go on... This is gonna take a while!

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

						KORBEN
				Other than that... You all right?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				...And now you're making fun of me?
				I'm warning you! If you don't take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, I'll

				All I want is an explanation! I just got
				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

				Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.

				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

						KORBEN
				Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

						MUNRO
					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						KORBEN
				What mission?

						MUNRO
				To save the world.

						KORBEN
				Where have I heard this song before?

						MUNRO
				You're to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions'?

						KORBEN
					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

						MUNRO
				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						MUNRO
				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						KORBEN
				And the third one?

						MUNRO
				You're the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

						MUNRO
				Don't you open your messages?

						KORBEN
				I've had enough good news for today

						MUNRO
					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

						KORBEN
				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

						MUNRO
				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

						KORBEN
					(sarcastic)
				You couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						MUNRO
				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						KORBEN
				I'm not going.

						MUNRO
				Why not?

						KORBEN
				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL

	Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the
card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	The doorbell rings.

						KORBEN
				...Scuse me.

	Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.
	Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

						KORBEN
				...Shit!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

						KORBEN
				It's my wife.

						MUNRO
				I thought you were divorced.

						KORBEN
				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates
				you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's
hands.

						KORBEN
				...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
				It'll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I'll be back.

						MUNRO
				Three of us will never fit in there!

						KORBEN
					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by Cornelius.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				I suppose that means "Hi" ?

						CORNELIUS
				I'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

						KORBEN
				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						CORNELIUS
				We're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

						KORBEN
				What kind of mission?

						CORNELIUS
					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

						KORBEN
					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

						CORNELIUS
				Of course.

						KORBEN
				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry..

						VOICE
				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING

	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

						VOICE
				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

						CORNELIUS
				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

						CORNELIUS
				What are you doing?

						KORBEN
				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

						VOICE
				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it
transparent.

						COP 1
				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

						COP 1
					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

						KORBEN
				No, I'm a meat popsicle.

						COP 3
					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

						COP 1
				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

						NEIGHBOR
				Fuck you!!

113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

						KORBEN
				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

114	INT.  HALL

	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

						COP
				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

						COP (O.S.)
				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

						RIGHT ARM
					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

						RIGHT ARM
				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's
name.

						RIGHT ARM
				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

						ZORG
				Don't come back without the Stones.

116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

						KORBEN
				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						KORBEN
			..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						LEELOO
					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

						KORBEN
				Uh..you're welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

						KORBEN
				Coffee!  That's what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						KORBEN
				With some honey!  You'll see, honey's
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						KORBEN
				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

						KORBEN
					(nervously)
				I've got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

						KORBEN
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						KORBEN
				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

						KORBEN
				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

						KORBEN
				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						KORBEN
				It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						KORBEN
				You hear that?

						LEELOO
					(licking)
				Cornelius..

						KORBEN
				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						LEELOO
				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

						KORBEN
				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

						LEELOO
					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

						CORNELIUS
				No, I'm not proud of myself...
				But we don't have the luxury of choice.

117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

118	INT.  SHED

	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

						AKANIT
				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

						AKNOT
				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He'll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

119	INT.  KORBEN'S APARTMENT  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

						KORBEN
				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

						KORBEN
				Yeah?

						MOTHER (V.O)
				Have you pulled yourself together?

						KORBEN
				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

						KORBEN
				I'll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

						CORNELIUS
				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

						CORNELIUS
				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

						LEELOO
				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

						CORNELIUS
				I can't pretend to be your husband...
				David's in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE

	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

						KORBEN
					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

						DAVID
					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

						KORBEN
					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David's fake ID.

						KORBEN
				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(looking at Leeloo's ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

						KORBEN
				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

						LEELOO
					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

						KORBEN
				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I'll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It's our honeymoon. We're going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

	ANGLE ON:

	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

						COP
					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she's also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

	ANGLE ON:

	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

						NEIGHBOR
					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that's me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

						NEIGHBOR
				We'll be right back ... we're gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

						ROBOT
				The same?

						CORNELIUS
				Yeah...

						DAVID (V.O.)
				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

						CORNELIUS
				Where's Leeloo?

						DAVID
				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

						CORNELIUS
				It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...
				It's my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

						CORNELIUS
				Here's the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

						NEIGHBOR
					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

						COP
					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

	ANGLE ON:

	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE

	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

123	INT.  HALL

	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

						STEWARDESS
				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

						KORBEN
				Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.
				I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

						STEWARDESS
				Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc
				Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

						KORBEN
					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ.

						LOC RHOD
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

						KORBEN
					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

						LOC RHOD
				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						LOC RHOD
				...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  And from what I'm looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						KORBEN
				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						LOC RHOD
				Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

						LOC RHOD
				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						LOC RHOD
				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your
				voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

						KORBEN
					(pissed)
				I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						LOC RHOD
					(petrified)
				Crystal.

124	INT.  AIRPORT

	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	Right Arm's smile shatters.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I'm the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

						RIGHT ARM
				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						RIGHT ARM
					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that's all... I'm calm now.

125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY

	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she
is doing.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				I'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I've got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

						LEELOO
				Love...

						KORBEN
				Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

						LEELOO
					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						KORBEN
				Sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						LEELOO
					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						KORBEN
				Know what? On that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

	ANGLE ON:

	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	ANGLE ON:

						LEELOO
					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

						KORBEN
				Finished what?

						LEELOO
				Learning language.

						KORBEN
				Which one?

						LEELOO
				All 900.

	Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

						KORBEN
				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						LEELOO
					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						KORBEN
				I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how
				to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

						LEELOO
				Apipoussan!

						KORBEN
				Apipoussan?

						LEELOO
				Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

						KORBEN
					(fumbling)
				Uh...

						LEELOO
				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						STEWARDESS
				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						STEWARDESS 2
				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						LOC RHOD
					(hugging her)
				I don't want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

						STEWARDESS 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

						LOC RHOD
				Now you're talking!

126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

	Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

						STEWARDESS 1
				Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.

						PILOT
					(checking her out)
				Thanks, Miss.

	The Stewardess leaves with a smile.  A red light flashes on the vast
control panel.

						MECHANIC
				Tell the ground crew we've got parasites
				in the landing gear.

127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY

	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

						RIGHT ARM
				Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				I'm listening.

						RIGHT ARM
				The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!
				He took my place.

						ZORG
				This is a joke, right?

129	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

						LOC RHOD
				No!! I swear to God! I've never been this
				sincere with a human before!

130 EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
	into the opening.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				You're fueled and ready to go.
				Have a nice flight.

131	INT.  SHUTTLE

						PILOT
					(to copilot)
				Everything ready for liftoff?

132	INT.  CABIN

				No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...

133	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE / AIRPORT  HALL

						ZORG
				I cannot hear you. We have a bad
				connection here.  What's your number?

	Right Arm reads off the phone number.

						RIGHT ARM
				278-500-645-321

						ZORG
				I'll call you back.

134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

135	INT.  SHUTTLE

	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

						COPILOT
				Anti static pressure?

						MECHANIC
				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly.

137	EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

138	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	A keyboard slowly appears in front of Zorg.

						ZORG
					(typing the number)
				278... 500...

139	SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

	The pilot gradually turns the engines up.

						COPILOT
				10 seconds...

						PILOT
				Power increase.

	- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that's about to
lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

						ZORG
				3... 2... 1...

	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

						PILOT
				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

	- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and
everything else   within 60 feet.

140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

141	INT.  COCKPIT

	In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

						COPILOT
					(relaxing)
				Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up.

142	INT.  CABIN

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben's.

143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT

	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


144	EXT.  SPACE

	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

145	INT.  SPACESHIP

	In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

						TECHNICIAN
				All right! We're finally getting something!

146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

						PRESIDENT
				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE

	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						ZORG
				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						SHADOW
				Am I disturbing you?

						ZORG
				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW'S breathing is awesome.

						SHADOW
				...Not far, now.

						ZORG
				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

						SHADOW
				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

						ZORG
				Got it.

						SHADOW
				How's our deal coming along?

						ZORG
					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						SHADOW
				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						ZORG
				The Stones will be here. I'll see to it
				personally!

						SHADOW
				...I can't wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE

	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

						STEWARDESS
				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

						STEWARDESS
					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

151	INT.  COCKPIT

	A blinking light goes on.

						PILOT
				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben's box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She's not there.

153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area.

						PILOT
				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

157	INT.  CABIN

	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle.

						KORBEN
					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I'm trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL

	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

						HOSTESS
					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

						HOST
					(playful)
				If you don't have the code you can't
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

						LOC RHOD
					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don't leave me here
				alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

						KORBEN
				I'll take you to the bar, after that,
				you're on your own.

						LOC RHOD
					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

						KORBEN
				I don't think this is a good time...

						LOC RHOD
				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

						KORBEN
					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

						LOC RHOD
				I didn't have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn't
				hear me...

159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

						KORBEN
				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn't bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

						HOSTESS
					(looking him over)
				Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				You little sleaze bag!

						KORBEN
				...Ma???

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				Don't you ever ask me for another thing
				in my life again, you've killed your
				poor mother with your own hands!

	Korben drops into an armchair and sighs. His eyes go to the ceiling.

						CHIEF OF POLICE

						FOG
				Yes. Sir!

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(to Cornelius)
				OK, let's hear it.

						CORNELIUS
				Where was I?

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(bored)
				...You open the door. There's a cabby with
				a girl in his arms.

	FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.
They hold up a THIRD COP.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

						BEAT-UP COP
				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...
				with green eyes.

	Cornelius perks up.

						CORNELIUS
				And the smile of an angel?

	They all turn to look at him.

						CORNELIUS
					(to Chief)
				May I speak to you alone.

167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				One last time...

	The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
					(nodding)
				Miss.

	Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

168	EXT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

						FOG
				Hello, I'm head of security.
				Everything is in order. You can...

	The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

						FOG
				...make yourselves at home safely.
				If you need anything...give it a knock!

169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks
both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet.

170	INT.  KORBEN'S  STATEROOM

	Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						KORBEN
				Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days
				vacation and I'll be damned if I'm
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	The door RINGS.

						KORBEN
				...Hang on, it's the door. No!
				I told you I didn't bring anybody!
				I'm all alone... as usual!

	Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(to his mother)
				...I'll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

						KORBEN
				Here we go again...

						LEELOO
					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						KORBEN
				You get that off the screen?

						LEELOO
				Yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

						KORBEN
				You noticed..

						LEELOO
				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

						KORBEN
				Where you going?

						LEELOO
				I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's
				the matter?... Do I look bad?

						KORBEN
				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

						LEELOO
				Do you know how this works?

	Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						KORBEN
				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

						KORBEN
				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

						LEELOO
				And you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

						KORBEN
				It's difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

						KORBEN
				Army issue. I'm sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

						LEELOO
					(seething)
				You're nothing but a... a...

						KORBEN
				The words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. I won't
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben my man what's happening here?
				Who's the chick? What's the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

						KORBEN
				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

Opera in Paris.  A hostess escorts them to their seats.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

	ANGLE ON:

	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

						BABY RAY
				...to who?

						LOC RHOD
					(moving down the aisle)
				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king
				of laserball and the best paid player in the League.
					(shakes hands as he goes by)
				...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet
				whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.
				"I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she
				recently confessed to me. She will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

						AKANIT
				It's showtime!

178	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

Speakers appear.

180	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

						MANAGER
					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Flowers for the Diva.

						MANAGER
				She's allergic to flowers!!!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				There's champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

						CORNELIUS

	The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window.

	FLASHBACK:

	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

188	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

						CORNELIUS
					(in a panic)
				Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I'm going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

						MANGALORE
				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

						LEELOO

			Apipoulai!

	The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo.

	INTERCUT':

	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

193	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

194	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

195	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL

	Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

196	INT.  ROOM

	Akanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

						MANGALORE
				They were waiting for us! It was an
				ambush!

						AKANIT
				If it's war they want it's war they'll get!
				Enact the Final Plan!

	All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

197	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there
holding a ZF1.

						ZORG
				My compliments, little lady!
				...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
				I couldn't have done it any better myself!
					(sharply)
				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

						ZORG
				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

198	INT.	AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

199	INT.  SUITE

	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

						ZORG
					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can't hide...

200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief's head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

						AKANIT
				Nobody move! We're taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

						CORNELIUS
					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

201	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

						MANGALORE 1
				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

203	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

204	INT.  CONCERT HALL

	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON

	Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

						ZORG
				You want something done, do it yourself!

206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

						LOC RHOD
					(voice low, panicked)
				They're hideous. They've got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

207	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

						PRESIDENT
				Send a battalion out immediately!

208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

						DIVA
				Don't worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

						KORBEN
				I've never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

						DIVA
					(weak)
				You're a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

						KORBEN
				Who?

						DIVA
				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo... is... she's...

						DIVA
				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she's the only one
				who knows how to use them.

						KORBEN
					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

209	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

						DIVA
				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						KORBEN
				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

						DIVA
				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						KORBEN
					(uncomfortable)
				I'll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

						DIVA
				Do you love her?

						KORBEN
				I... I don't know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						DIVA
				I don't have time... I need to know.

						KORBEN
				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

						DIVA
				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva's eyes close.

211	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

						KORBEN
				Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!
				You're not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

213	INT.  SPACESHIP

	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It's empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

						DIVA
					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

						MANGALORE 2
				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						KORBEN
				...In me?

	He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						LOC RHOD
				Don't you think we'd better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						MANGALORE
				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						KORBEN
				That's it... I've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						KORBEN
				You don't do what I say... I'll waste
				you myself. Got it?

						LOC RHOD
				Got it...

215	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

216	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

						AKANIT
				What's the situation in the hall?

217	INT.  HALL

	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

						MUGGER
					(into walkie-talkie)
				There's no more resistance.
				Everything's under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

						KORBEN
				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

						LOC RHOD
				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

						LOC RHOD
				It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

						PRINCESS AACHEN
					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

						LOC RHOD
				GET OFF MY BACK!

	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

						KORBEN
				Toss me the balls!

						BABY RAY
					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

						KORBEN
				The balls for Christ's sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

						EMPEROR JAPHET
				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

						KORBEN
				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

						EMPEROR
				I'd say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb's up.

						LOC RHOD
				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an
				amazing 90 foot pitch.

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

						FOG
				Thanks for your help.

						KORBEN
				Forget it.

	Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him.

218	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Korben bursts into the room. He stares at the luminous bar still struck
to the ground and sees the hole Leeloo escaped through.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo???

219	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE - CEILING

	Leeloo in bleeding all over.  She can barely move.

	The last of the Mangalores have barricaded themselves in the back of the

policemen already there.

						COP 1
				Hey, who are you?

						KORBEN
				The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.

	Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives.

						KORBEN
				Seven to the left. Five to the right.

						COP
				What's he doing?

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

						KORBEN
				Six to the left. One to the right.

						LOC RHOD
				He's on vacation.

						KORBEN
					(reloading)
				We got to find the leader. Mangalores
				don't fight without a leader.

223	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit gets up, grabs Cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head.

						AKANIT
				One more shot and we start killing
				hostages, got that?

224	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY

						KORBEN
				Found him...

						AKANIT
					(tense)
				Send someone to negotiate!

						KORBEN
				Mind if I go? I'm an excellent
				negotiator.

						COP 1
				Uh... Sure, go ahead.

	Korben gets ready.

						COP 1
				We're sending someone in who's
				authorized to negotiate.

225	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his
gun and puts a bullet through his head.

						KORBEN
				Anyone else want to negotiate?

						COP 2
					(to another Cop)
				Where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

226	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				From us!

	The President gives Munro a hard look.

227	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

						CORNELIUS
				You're probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

						KORBEN
				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo's in trouble?

						KORBEN
				When is she not in trouble?

						CORNELIUS
				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

228	INT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE  LANDING  DOCK  AND  GARAGE

	The ZFX200 settles in the landing dock garage.  SECURITY POLICE approach
the ship just as Zorg in getting out holding the ZF1.

						POLICEMAN

						ZORG
				Nothing I can't fix myself.

	He brings up the ZF1 and wipes out the garage.

229	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Korben enters the Diva's suite which is in shambles.  He looks

231	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Exhausted, Loc Rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face
with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(loudly)
				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

						LEELOO
				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

						KORBEN
				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what're these numbers clicking
				by?

						CORNELIUS
				Probably the time remaining before it
				explodes.

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

						LOC RHOD
					(weak smile)
				You're just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.
				There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is a Type A alert. For security reasons

				Maybe we oughta be going,

						KORBEN
				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

						KORBEN
				It's the latest model.. I've never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

235	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben's hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						KORBEN
				Don't worry, I'm here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						KORBEN
				Just relax. I've got the Stones.
				Everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(falling to pieces)
				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of

				I'll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						ZORG
				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

						ZORG
				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special
				Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

	Korben doesn't reply.

						ZORG
				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

						ZORG
				...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

						KORBEN
				Don't you know how to count.
				It's not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

						KORBEN
				One! That's for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

						KORBEN
				Two! That's for firing me! Three!
				That's for pushing around a priest!
				And the rest is for what you did to
				my wife!

	Korben pummels him mercilessly.

237	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3
minutes.

						KORBEN

						LEELOO
				Protect life... Until death.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

						CORNELIUS
				There's a General on the phone...
				His name's Mambo, I think.

256	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				Munro here. President Lindberg wants
				to talk to you.  Hold the line.

	The President clears his throat and takes the phone.

						PRESIDENT
				Major, first off, I want to thank you,
				in my name and in the name of the
				Federation...

257	INT.  ZFX200 / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				For the praiseworthy courage you have
				shown us! I'd like to congratulate General
				Munro for his choice. He found the ideal
				man for such a...

						KORBEN
					(to the point)
				So now what's the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

						PRESIDENT
				There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
				heading straight for the earth. And we have
				no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

						KORBEN
				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

						SCIENTIST
				If its speed remains constant... in an
				hour and 57 minutes.

						KORBEN (O.S.)
				I'll call you back in two hours.

	Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned.

258	EXT.  SPACE

	The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded
cosmos.

259	INT.  CHAPEL

	David is asleep.  He is woken by the sound of...

260	EXT.  DESERT - DAWN

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

						DAVID
				You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

						CORNELIUS
				Later, David! Later!
				There's not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

261	INT.  CHAPEL

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray
				later?

	Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off
lowering the altar like a service elevator.

	The altar descends amid rocky walls.

262	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				They just landed in the desert.

						PRESIDENT
					(sweating)
				How much time is left?

263	EXT.  SPACE

	Earth is in view.  The Dark Planet fills the screen and heads for the
blue planet.

264	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

265	INT.  TEMPLE

	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

						CORNELIUS
					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

						KORBEN
				Don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

						CORNELIUS
				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don't have the reference book.
				I've never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

						KORBEN
				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

						LOC RHOD
				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

						KORBEN
				No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				There's no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

						KORBEN
				And you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						CORNELIUS
				That's what I'm saying.

266	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly.

267	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben leans over Leeloo.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open
				them! How does it work?

						LEELOO
					(feeble)
				The wind blows... the fire burns...

						KORBEN
				I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking
				about the Stones.

						LEELOO
				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

						KORBEN
				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

						KORBEN
				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(afraid)
				I'm looking, I'm looking.

268	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The tension is palpable in the President's office.

						SCIENTIST
				...Three minutes.

						MUNRO
				We've lost contact with them.

269	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

						LOC RHOD
				...we'll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

						LOC RHOD
				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

						KORBEN
				What did you say? What did you do?

						LOC RHOD
				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
				nothing!

						KORBEN
				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						LOC RHOD
				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

	Nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				Is that all?

						LOC RHOD
				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.

						KORBEN
				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

						KORBEN
				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

						LOC RHOD
					(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

						KORBEN
				Don't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

270	EXT.  SPACE

	A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles
away.

271	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					Two more minutes.

	The President shuts his eyes.  His lids move in prayer.

272	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors
crisscross.

						KORBEN
				It's up to you now, Angel!

						LEELOO
				I'm so tired...

						KORBEN
				You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

						LEELOO
				I want to sleep... forever...

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on
				a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,
				this time, for as long as you want.
				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						CORNELIUS
				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

273	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.  A hundred miles before impact.
The African continent is visible.  No doubt about it:	The fireball is
heading right for Egypt.

274	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist's stopwatch.

						SCIENTIST
				It'll be entering the atmosphere in one
				minute.

275	INT.  CHAPEL

	The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's.  A drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! If you don't get on with the
				program we're all gonna die! And that's
				not on my agenda for today.

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

						LEELOO
					(weak)
				What's the use of saving lives...
				when you see what you do with them!

						KORBEN
				You're right but there are lots of good
				things... beautiful things...

						LEELOO
				...Like love...

						KORBEN
				Exactly.

						LEELOO
				But I don't know love... I'm like a machine
				programmed to save other people's lives but
				never to have one of my own.

276	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Scientist's stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds.

277	INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				I have thousands of memories but none
				of them are mine... There is no need for
				me other than this. I'm immortal but I have
				no life.

						KORBEN
				Yes, you do! I need you. More than you
				can imagine! Stand up straight!

						LEELOO
				Why?... Why would you need me?

						KORBEN
				Because...

						CORNELIUS
					(to himself)
				Tell her, for God's sake!

	A bit of the black acid falls on Loc Rhod's shirt setting it on fire.  He
rips if off.

	CUT TO:

278	INT.  CHAPEL

						KORBEN
				Because...

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is
everywhere.

						LEELOO
				Tell me...

						KORBEN
				I love you...

	Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

	CUT TO:

278b	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

279 INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				Now you're allowed to kiss me.

	- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

280	EXT.  SPACE

	The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
	Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

281	INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

	President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead-

						SCIENTIST
				The planet seems to have stopped at...
				62 miles from impact.

282	INT.  CHAPEL

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

	Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

						LOC RHOD
				This guy is a killer with the babes.
				I knew it from the moment I laid eyes
				on him.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on
kissing.

283	INT.  LABORATORY

	We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  The President enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						MUNRO
				Mr. President, let me introduce you to
				Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						MACTILBURGH
				It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
					(beaming)
				Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

						MACTILBURGH
				They were so tired from their ordeal that
				we put them in the reactor this morning..

						PRESIDENT
				I have 19 more meetings after this one
				Professor..

						PROFESSOR
				Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.

						AIDE
				We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.

						MACTILBURGH
				I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				Mr. President.

	The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						AIDE
				No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...

						PRESIDENT
				Who is it?

						AIDE
				Some woman... claims she's Korben's

						PRESIDENT
				Give it here...

	The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

						PRESIDENT
				Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.
				On behalf of the entire Federation,
				I would like to thank...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Don't pull that crap with me, Finger...
				I'd recognize that trash can voice of

	Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.

	PAN slowly across Manhattan.

          FADE IN:
                         
          EXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNING
                         
          At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an
          endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums
          beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.
                         
          The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:
          the white disc goes through a rapid series of color
          transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible
          BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.
                         
          The sky echoes with THUNDER.
                         
          We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush
          stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with
          each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
                         
          Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning
          blood-red savanna.
                         
          EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
                         
          I's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It
          buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's
          almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.
                         
          INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
                         
          There are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN,
          a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and
          reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A
          Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the
          open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.
          He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed
          things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows
          indicating the directions of movement.
                         
          Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks
          the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with
          sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture
          that's habitual to her in moments of stress.
                         
          There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She
          looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,
          leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.

                          CO-PILOT

                          FLASH)
           Can I have an autograph for my kid,

                          FLASH
           Sure -- my pleasure.
                         
          As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane
          takes another jolt, even more violent than the first.
                         
                          PILOT
           Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see
           what they've got.
                         
                          FLASH
           I sure hope we don't have to turn
           back. I mean this is first day of
           training camp, I wouldn't want to be

           Seat-belt time.
                         
          FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders
          violently. He holds on, calls up front:
                         
                          FLASH
           Maybe it'd be smoother if you went
                          HIGHER --

           Will you SHUT UP?
           (as FLASH's head
                          SWIVELS)
           Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have
           their hands full -- just let 'em

          The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of
          the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to
          her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it
          to her.

          EXT. SKY - POV FROM PLANE WINDOW - DAY
                         
          The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to
          surround the airplane. Over the engines we HEAR that same
          ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening. Slowly
          and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning BLOOD RED. The clouds
          race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past
          the plane from behind.
                         
          INT. PLANE - DAY
                         
          FLASH and DALE -- faces bathed in the eerie light. Speechless-
          DALE grasps the football player's hand with all her strength.
                         
          EXT. A FANTASTIC GREENHOUSE - DAY
                         
          It is a huge and rambling, antique, standing in semiruinous
          isolation in a pretty country landscape. The sun has turned
           4.
                         
          the SAME BLOOD RED we saw from the airplane, and clouds race
          across it with unnatural velocity.
                         
          In the center of the greenhouse rises a glass-paned tower
          through which we glimpse something MIRROR BRIGHT. Floating
          high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-
          filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we
          discern a MAN moving about actively on a platform inside the
          central tower, about half-way up:
                         
          INT. GREENHOUSE TOWER - DAY
          (MUNSON, TV NEWSMAN, ZARKOV)
                         
          The man is DR. HANS ZARKOV: big, bearded, feverish looking
          and seemingly half mad with exhaustion. In striking contrast
          to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds
          of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash
          fashion. Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and
          dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. As
          Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a
          grim-voiced TV. NEWSMAN is appearing and speaking from a
          good-sized television screen above the main control console:
                         
                          TV NEWSMAN
           The extraordinary weather disturbances
           reported from Africa this morning
           are now crossing the Atlantic, and
           are expected to reach the East Coast
           of the United States by noon.
           According to scientists at NASA, the
           Earth is being struck by an immense
           stream of cosmic energy, apparently
           the result of some catastrophic
           stellar accident beyond the reaches
                          OF --
                         
          ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the
          silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Fools! Can't you understand? This
           is no accident-- it's an ATTACK! An
           attack planned by a MIND! This is
           ATTACK!
                         
          MUNSON, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the
          stairs with a computer print-out sheet.
                         
                          MUNSON
           Dr. Zarkov! Look at the report from
           the last balloon!
                         
          ZARKOV grabs it, eyes it.

                          MUNSON
           Yes, sir -- you sure did. And this
           funny sun too ---

                          ZARKOV
           What the hell do I care? I tried to
           warn him -- he called me mad, like
           all the others.
                         
          BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.
                         
                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)
           Time for us to go, Munson. Get your
           toothbrush and whatever.
                         
                          MUNSON
           Go where?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Up. Up and at him.
                         
          Stunned, MUNSON turns his head and glances at something big
          and MIRROR BRIGHT gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.
                         
                          MUNSON
           You're crazy!
                         
          Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes,
          ZARKOV pulls out a revolver and points it at MUNSON.
                         
                          ZARKOV

          The PILOTS watch these clouds also, transfixed with disbelief.
          They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of
          professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe.

           Say, get a load of the VOR's....
                         
          The directional needles are going crazy. All the instruments
          are going crazy. Displays flash impossible symbols. The
          PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the
          sky and swallows.
                         
                          PILOT
           On the left, about six o'clock
           high......
                         
          The racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some
          surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED
          LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the
          plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE.
                         
                          PILOT (CONT'D)
           Hold on tight, let's put baby down
           right here......
                         
          The CO-PILOT reaches up and hits the flap control. There is
          a whooshing crackling ZAP! The whole cockpit FLARES OUT
          with an intolerable blinding flash of RED LIGHT.
                         
          INT. PASSENGER CABIN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The cockpit door flys off its hinges, admitting a gale of
          wind that scatters FLASH'S play sheets like autumn leaves.
          FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward.
                         
          INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
          (DALE, FLASH)
                         
          The TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from
          the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He
          stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering
          he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the
          bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals.
          DALE lurches in against the tornado.
                         
                          DALE

          Another barrage of crackling RED LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot all

          which rain down in intermittent bursts. One strikes an end
          of a gallery, exploding glass and foliage. From inside, we

          ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his
          revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he
          was hiding.

           right about you. Have a nice trip.
                         
          MUNSON starts walking away, toward the door at the end of
          the long side wing.

          MUNSON ignores him totally, keeps walking away. ZARKOV lifts
          his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back. Just as he
          is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside.

          Amazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough
          landing in the field outside. The plane hits on one wheel,
          bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on
          rolling toward the greenhouse.

          ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the
          tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV
          with a funny expression.

                          ZARKOV
           How did you know?
           10.
                         
                          DALE
           I saw you in PEOPLE mag. After you
           left NASA, remember? It said you
           were utterly ---
                         
          DALE breaks off, almost biting her tongue.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Insane? Off my rocker?
                         
                          DALE
           I forget what it said:
                          (TURNING HASTILY)
           Flash, let's find some other phone,
           okay? I'm sure Dr. Zarkov is very
           busy.......
                         
          FLASH is baffled, but he gets her urgent look.
                         
                          FLASH
           Well, all right -- but it seems to
           me we ought to --
                         
          Now it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a
          gun at him.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Up the stairs to the tower! Ahead
           of me -- quick! --
           (as they gape at him,
                          FROZEN)
           Quick I said: We haven't much time --
           Earth is being attacked! -- there's
           only one slim chance of saving it!
                         
                          FLASH
           Mister, you are insane!
                         
          HOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass
          showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry
          foliage bursts into FLAME.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Up the stairs -- RUN!
                         
          ZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap
          around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead
          of ZARKOV.
                         
                          FLASH
           Go with the flow -- wait for a chance!
                         
          Below them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH.
           11.
                         
          INT. TOP LEVEL OF GREENHOUSE TOWER
          (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)
                         
          ZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR
          BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that
          open.
                         
          On every side things are blowing up and burning under the
          merciless rain of bolts. One strikes the capsule head on,
          but does not even leave a mark.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           I need your help to take off! Get
           in or I shot you dead!
                         
          DALE gasps and shrinks back.
                         
                          FLASH
           Take off for where?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           God only knows -- whatever black
           corner of space this is coming from --
           wherever HE is!. -- we'll plunge
           into the devil's heart and destroy
           him! We'll die ourselves, of course,
           but our names will be honored till
           the end of time!
                         
                          DALE
           Look, Doc -- I don't book kamikaze
           tours -- never.
                         
          FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off-
          balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE
          (DALE, ZARKOV)
                         
          It is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only
          on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but
          in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed
          from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is
          from everyday science.
                         
          Immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity,
          ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Sit down there! Foot on the red pedal!
                         
                          DALE
           Flash! Sack him!
           12.
                         
          ZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He
          punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the
          well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again.
          Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch.
                         
          The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out
          through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself
          was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's
          left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those
          LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy.
                         
          FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms
          around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly
          increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster
          and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back
          against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.
                         
          We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part
          of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted
          by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving
          as he speaks with enormous effort:
                         
           ZARKOV,
           Friendship...Built this to send to
           them in...Friendship...The end
           now...End of the world....Unless we
                          ····
           (every sound an effort
                          NOW)
           Unless...We...Three...Can...
                         
          ZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness.
                         
          EXT. GREENHOUSE - LONG SHOT (MINIATURE)
                         
          Totally ablaze within now, one huge fantastic jewel of fire.
          The whole central tower explodes outward. From the inferno a
          MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking
          up speed again as it ascends.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT
                         
          Whirling, whirling, invincibly unharmed by the LASER BOLTS
          which glance off it again and again, accelerating up into
          space.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT - POV
                         
          The EARTH recedes below into a ball, RED-HUED' under the
          fantastic sun. A fast approaching light FLARES up against
          the mirrored surface and is recognised as our MOON. It flashes
          past, follows EARTH into e distance. All around, the sky
          darkens into the void of space.
                         
          FANTASTIC MONTAGE - OUTER PLANETS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
           13.
                         
          They hurtle past the capsule in rapid sequences:
                         
                         RED MARS
                         
          A sudden gauntlet of careening ASTEROIDS, all sizes, from
          tiny zingers to one almighty tumbler big as AFRICA.
                         
          Mammoth JUPITER with thirteen moons and its atmosphere of
          deadly methane clouds more than 1000 miles deep. The RED
          PATCH on its surface is a storm 20,000 miles across which
          has raged without intermission for 200 EARTH centuries.
          Through the RINGS OF SATURN in a dazzling LIGHTSTORM of
          blazing ice crystals.
                         
          NEPTUNE, PLUTO, outermost URANUS. One after another the
          planets are left hurtling behind, wheeling in their concentric
          orbits, the entire SOLAR SYSTEM dwindling into nothing.
                         
          EXT. A SPIRAL NEBULA
                         
          It tilts and wheels wondrously as the Capsule passes through
          the middle of it. Considering that this Nebula is probably a
          million light-years from edge to edge, we get some notion of
          the Capsule's speed.

          Curving light-rays from another galaxy are drawn fantastically
          together and then simply DISAPPEAR as they are pulled in by
          the unimaginable gravitation force of is THING. we SEE the
          CAPSULE, tiny, curving, and spinning along amidst the mind-
          blowing display of light rays, sucked along with them ····
          then simply DISAPPEARING as it too enters the void.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT
          (KLYTUS, MING)
                         
          Visible again, gleaming in an AMBER GLOW. Suddenly a dancing
          grid of lines appears OVER IT, making us realise that we
          must be SEEING IT on some kind of screen. It BLURS out of
          focus, comes back again more sharply as some adjustment has
          apparently been made.

          Curve of lip, flare of nostril, fold of eyelid, gleam of
          shaven scalp, each a menacing landscape of sensual shadow as
                         WE HEAR:

           Later, Klytus -- I think we will
           look at them first.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE - SHOOTING FROM WITHIN
                         
          Through the transparent walls as the spinning motion is
          rapidly SLOWING DOWN. The three voyagers are crumpled on the
          floor against the wall in strange attitudes, FLASH'S arms
          still holding DALE. They seem semi-conscious, as if dropped.
                         
          An AMBER GLOW bathes them, and soon we see its source. A
          huge planet wheels into view through the transparent wall.
          It is MONGO. Its curved surface is a pure sea of AMBER FIRE
          molten lava, with great tongues of flame erupting
          horrifically.
                         
          ZARKOV blinks, struggles to focus his eyes. He succeeds,
          with horror SEES where they are headed. Making a choking
          sound, ZARKOV stirs and tries to crawl over to a control
          panel. He pushes switches. Nothing happens. The CAPSULE
          keeps on going down. A great leaping tongue of fire licks
          it.
                         
          Suddenly, just as destruction seems imminent, the capsule
          miraculously changes its flight path and soars above the
          remaining flames.
                         
          It races through them. A shadow passes over MONGO as the
          CAPSULE passes through a wall of PURPLE VAPOR and emerges
          above a totally different landscape. A dozen VARIOUS COLORED
          CLOUDS sweep past in silent majesty.
                         
          The CAPSULE slows, hovers starts straight down into a sea of
          high grass.
                         
          EXT. MONGO -- GRASSY AREA - EVENING
                         
          In the distant B.G. against an extraordinary SUNSET SKY,
          rises the shimmering CITY OF MONGO.... a place of many levels,
          golden tiers and turrets, towers, flags and pennants. It is
          like something dreamed.
                         
          Several STRANGELY ARMORED MEN watch the MIRROR-BRIGHT CAPSULE
          descending slowly. The LEADER waves and they all start toward
          the CAPSULE.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE

          Gentle bump as the thing touches down.
           15.

           I don't know.
                         
          Suddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through
          the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and
          SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching.
                         
                          DALE
           Don't. Suddenly I like it in here

          The door of the CAPSULE is opened from the inside. ZARKOV
          and DALE and FLASH get out. THE MEN stop. Long beat as the
          two parties gaze at each other, the first human eye ever to
          see an extraterrestrial being. FLASH walks up to the leader.
                         
                          FLASH
           Hello -- my name's Flash Gordon --

          With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand.
                         
                          FLASH
           Hi!

          Another strange glimpse through an opening. Some fierce
          tethered BEAST is being goaded and tormented by MONGO MEN,
          as in an Elizabethan bear-baiting. On the floor lies the
          tor n body of one MAN who apparently got too close.
                         
          DALE has one brief horrified GLIMPSE of this, then turns her
          head away and shuts her eyes as she's marched along.
                         
                          DALE
           Just do what I'm doing. Flash --
                         
                          FLASH
           What are you doing?
                         
                          DALE
           Shutting my eyes -- dreaming I booked
           us to Disneyland.
                         
          INT. MAIN PALACE HALL
                         (ARMORED MEN)
                         
          A gigantic STATUE comes into view amidst topless columns at
          the end. Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns. As
          we come nearer, we SEE that this STATUE is cut out in the
          middle to form a throne.
                         
          MING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing
          down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before
          him.
                         
                          ARMORED MEN
           Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
           Mercy!
                         
          A hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through
          unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly
          in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the
          left of the group.
                         
          INT. PALACE OF HALLS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES
          (ARMORED MAN, AURA, DALE, FLASH, KLYTUS, LEADER, MING, VOICES,
                         ZARKOV)
                         
          As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED
          MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces
           17.
                         
          bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable
          dimension.
                         
          We pass an archway opening into what seems to be an AMUSEME-
          NT ARCADE. Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic
          games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to
          unearthly music.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Fantastic -- into a Black Hole and
           out the other side -- to this. Who
           said Hans Zarkov was mad?
                         
                          DALE
           You're mad.
                         
          Look down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass
          is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic
          swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the
          blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist
          EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire.
                         
                          FLASH
           You got us into this -- HOW DO WE
           GET OUT?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Get out? Why? We're being taken to
           Ming -- getting at him is our only
           hope of saving EARTH. It's perfect!
                         
                          FLASH
           Dr. Zarkov, I'm about to show you
           what it feels like to be clipped by
           a New York Giant --
                         
                          DALE
           Flash, it's no use - he's too crazy!
                         
                          MING
           Step forward, Soldier.
                         
          The designated one marches two paces forward, halts.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           Are you loyal to Ming? Would you
           die for him?
                         
                          ARMORED MAN
           Gladly!
                         
                          MING
           Fall on your sword.
           18.
                         
          Instantly the ARMORED MAN pulls his sword, rips open his
          breast-plate, sets the sword hilt-down on the floor and
          PLUNGES FORWARD on to the fatal point.
                         
          With a little cry of horror, DALE shrinks back into FLASH'S
          arms.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           You inhuman fiend!
                         
                          MING
           Of course I'm "inhuman"! -- that's a
           compliment!
           (Dropping his voice)
           Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering
           if you are alone in the universe --
           beaming you plaintive messages into
           to the void for anything that might
           hear you -- even hurling your bodies
           out into it -- and all without the
           faintest inkling of who or what is
           out here. If you had known anything --
           anything at all about the true nature
           of the universe, you would have hidden
           from it, in terror!
                         
          There is a low throaty LAUGH from the shadows. FLASH and
          DALE turn their eyes quickly in its direction.
                         
          FEATURE PRINCESS AURA
                         
          Emerging half into the light beside a column, fondling the
          head of an obscure BEAST slouching between her legs.
          Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks
          FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure
          of her touch.
                         
          FLASH can't take his eyes off her. No normal man could. FLASH
          swallows with a dry throat as AURA'S gaze devours him. DALE
          gets the electricity going on, gives him a poke and WHISPERS
          LOUDLY.
                         
                          DALE
           Watch it, fella -- you came with me!
                         
          AURA laughs again, sidles up toward MING. We dimly SEE a
          couple of MUTANT CREATURES dragging away the lifeless body
          of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty.
                         
                          MING
           You know who Ming is now -- who are
           you and why do you come to Mongo?
           19.
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm Flash Gordon of the New York
           Giants this is Dale Arden -- Dr.Zarkov
           hijacked us in an effort to save
           EARTH.
                         
          MING looks questioningly at KLYTUS
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Sirs, Earth is the meaningless planet
           you are in the process of
           obliterating.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           (pouncing on that)
           In the process? You mean Earth still
           exists?
                         
                          MING
           For the moment -- not for much longer.
                         
                          FLASH
           But why? What in hell have we ever
           done to hurt you?
                         
                          MING
           You exist -- and yet you pay no homage
           to Ming! What greater crime can be
           committed?
                         
          The palace rings with an answering chorus: VOICES of all the
          ARMORED MEN and numerous others presently UNSEEN, including
          many WOMEN.
                         
                          VOICES
           Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
           Mercy!
                         
                          MING
           Come closer, Dale Arden -- let me
           see you.
                         
          DALE doesn't move. MING takes a step down, narrows his eyes
          and gazes at her intensely. This guy's personal magnetism
          is enormous. As if irresistibly drawn, DALE steps forward.
                         
          MING moves his hand in a gesture. A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT
          bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard. DALE's lips
          open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing
          increases. MING touches her flesh lightly.
                         
          FLASH tense, ready to spring.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           This woman will amuse you.
           20.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (INTERESTED)
           Klytus can see the future, eh?
                         
                          MING
           He can foresee it -- but for a few
           moments only. It gives him a unique
           gift for survival, -- and treachery.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Extraordinary. I'd like to study
           his beta factors -- I wager I could
           extend them with a course of
           telekinetic exercise.
           (peering at KLYTUS)
           Tell me -- when you use this fit
           does your temporal lobe prickle?
           Here?
                         
          MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses
          the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN.
                         
                          MING
           Chain this one up. Preserve him for
           further examination.
                         
                          LEADER
           Hail, Ming!
                         
          ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily
          as they drag the scientist away.
                         
                          FLASH
           Oh no you don't! We came together
           and we're STAYING together!
                         
          Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger.
                         
                          MING
           That one is useless to us. Remove
           him and kill him.
                         
          Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in
          front of her friend.
                         
                          DALE
           You dirty old bastard can kill me
           too!
                         
          CLOSE ANGLE - AURA
                         
          Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING:
           21.
                         
                          AURA
           Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him
           to me!
                         
                          MING
                          (EYEBROWS UP)
           What would your Prince Barin say?
                         
                          AURA
           I can handle Barin.
                         
                          MING
           Really, Aura -- your appetites are
           too monstrous -- even for our family.
           This could cause great trouble with
           Barin -- I must forbid it.
                         
          AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she
                         WHISPERS AGAIN:
                         
                          AURA
           But you adore me, Father -- you ca
           refuse me nothing . Yes?
                         
                         WIDER SHOT
                         
          As MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter
          and indicates DALE.
                         
                          MING
           Take the Earth-woman to our quarters!
           Bathe and annoint her for our
           pleasure!
                         
          A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE.
                         
          FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it
          DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she
          flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city-
          girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own
          prowess.
                         
                          DALE
           My God -- and I thought that book
           was another rip-off-
                         
                          FLASH
           Watch out! Behind you!
                         
          Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards
          DALE.
                         
                         QUICK ANGLES
           22.
                         
          FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one.
          He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it
          quickly to knock cold the other two.
                         
          AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs
          her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth.
                         
          Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised
          mace.
                         
          Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the
          Cavernous space above.
                         
          To its tempo MING'S PERSONAL GUARDS now starts· appearing.
          They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing
          thing is that they all have the SAME FACE.
                         
          From left to right, back and front, the AMAZONS advance 0n
          FLASH and DALE. They do not attack, merely stun ad overwhelm
          us with their massive, silent, answerable threat.
                         
          FLASH swallows, looks this way and that, stands as if
          paralysed.
                         
                          DALE
           (low and tremulous)
           What's the play, Flash?
                         
                          FLASH
           I can't -- I just can't --
                         
                          DALE
           Can't what?
                         
                          FLASH
           Clobber a woman, Dale --
                         
                          DALE
                          (OUTBURST)
           You damn fool, those aren't women
           they're murderous AMAZON DYKES!
                         
          The AMAZONS are all around DALE now.
                         
                          DALE (CONT'D)
           Help!!
                         
          FLASH is paralyzed by indecision one beat more, then suddenly
          makes up his mind. He flies into action, SLAMS the nearest
          pair of AMAZONS.
           23.
                         
          INT. PALACE - FIGHT SEQUENCE
                         (DALE)
                         
          Fast and furious. Great havoc is wreaked by DALE and her
          karate, by FLASH and his flailing fists, but the AMAZONS'
          numerical superiority is of course decisive.
                         
          Soon FLASH is on the floor, pinioned by a dozen AMAZONS.
                         
          He looks up, with despairing eyes SEES poor DALE being dragged
          up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper
          gloom.
                         
                          DALE
           Flash!!
                         
          The pitiful shout sends FLASH'S adrenaline rushing. With a
          superhuman effort, he fights free from the pile-up and dashes
          after DALE.
                         
          INT. PALACE - ON THE STAIRCASE
                         
          FLASH struggles to get through to DALE.
                         
          DALE claws fiercely at the bare AMAZON arms and shoulders
          that engulf her, reaches desperately back down for FLASH.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT - THEIR HANDS
                         
          Just touching their fingertips.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT - A STEP OF THE STAIRS
                         
          Opens like a yawning trap door UNDER FLASH'S FEET.
                         
          FLASH drops away with a YELL, in the very instant that AURA
          comes running INTO THE SHOT and boldly JUMPS after him.
          AURA is swallowed up too, a split-second before the trap
          door step CLOSES again after them.
                         
          INT. PALACE - CU-MING
          (KLYTUS, MING)
                         
          Watching that, as KLYTUS hisses into his ear.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           She betrays you! She'll take him to
           Aboria!
                         
                          MING
           So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon
           for me -- I don't care.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Don't be too sure!
           24.
                         
          MING glances at him, then back up the stairs at where DALE
          has vanished. His face softens, his tone turns museful!
                         
                          MING
           I haven't taken a wife in centuries.
           I could bring myself to marry this
           Dale Arden --
                          (A BEAT)
           What do you see in her future, Klytus?
                         
          NO reply. MING turns his head and finds that KLYTUS is gone.
          Vanished. Not particularly surprised or concerned, MING gazes
          again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own
          question with a licentious smile.
                         
          INT. A DARK METALLIC SHAFT - SHOOTING DOWN IT
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          It is seemingly endless, faintly lt by phosphoresence from
          below. We dimly make out the figures of FLASH and AURA falling
          away from us, far below, falling, falling. We HEAR Hollow
          echoing VOICES reverbrating up to us.
                         
                          AURA
           Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle
           after we hit the water -- I'll lead
           you!
                         
                          FLASH
           Hit what water?
                         
          In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH.
                         
          INT. UNDERWATER (TANK)
                         
          FLASH plummets down, AURA right after him. Recovering balance
          in a universe of bubbles, FLASH finds himself confronting an
          enormous savage LUMINOUS FISH. Wheeling himself away in
          fear and revulsion, FLASH encounters AURA. He seizes her
          ankle as directed. Holding his beat, FLASH swims after her
          through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern
          floor. AURA dives down, leads him OUT OF SIGHT through a low
          opening.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND GROTTO
          (AURA, FLASH, PLASH)
                         
          FLASH and AURA emerge from a pool of water. FLASH staggers
          across and collapses on a fringe of beach. For sure, AURA'S
          wet clinging robe doesn't make her look any less sexy. He
          stares at her.
                         
                          AURA
           Catch your breath -- then I'll take
           you up and find you a disguise.

           You're saving my life. How can I
           Thank you?
                         
                          AURA
           I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria -
           we'll find a way.
                         
                          FLASH
           Let's get one thing straight -- I've
           got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov
           too -- rescue them and try to save
           Earth too.
                         
                          AURA
           Do you realize how foolish you are
           to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter?
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm no good at lying.
                         
                          AURA
           You're funny -- are all Eathlings
           like you, Flash Gordon?
                         
                          PLASH
           I guess I'm about average.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          There are windows on one side, emitting a fierce GLARE. FLASH
          follows AURA rapidly along. Suddenly he stops short, looking
          in through the tinted glass.
                         
          WHAT HE SEES - PLASMA CAVERN
                         
          An infernal place, chief feature of which is a LAKE OF
          SEETHING MAGMA that slowly rotates within a wide encircling
          platform. The platform is piled with GLOWING RADIOACTIVE
          GRAVEL, being shoveled into the magma by LIZARDMAN SLAVES
          who toil in rythmic unison.
                         
           FLASH (O.S.)
           What's that?
                         
           AURA (O.S.)
           The plasma core. It's e source of
           the energy-beam my father ia aiming
           at Earth. You can't stop it. Ming is
           merciless and all-powerful!
                         
          ANGLES - LIZARDMAN SLAVES
           26.
                         
          Showing ankle electrodes shackled to each SLAVE, so that
          those who collapse can be shocked back to their feet by GUARDS
          stationed on a surrounding catwalk above. Any SLAVE unable
          to rise is summarily pitched into the magma by HOODED MEN,
          waiting like executioners to perform this chore.
                         
           AURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           The slaves are Lizard Men. Once they
           had their own water Kingdom, the
           fairest of Mongo. Then they dared to
           rebel. They will suffer for it here
           forever.
                         
          FLASH looks at AURA again, then back in the window. He
          reacts.

          ZARKOV is being led along by SOLDIERS, heavily shackled. He
          stops, gazing in wonder at the seething lake, which FLARES
          UP BLINDINGLY with each shovel full of gravel.
                         
          FLASH and AURA
                         
                          AURA
           You can't reach him. If a soldier
           spots you, it's instant death! --
           Come!
                         
          AURA takes his hand. With one backward look toward ZARKOV
          who of course has not seen him, FLASH follows her.

           You guess well, Dr. Zarkov!
                         
          ZARKOV wheels in his chains, looks up.

          High above this place where MING stands with KLYTUS, lit by
          the infernal glare as he goes on:
           27.
                         
                          MING
           I am forcing this plasma through the
           successive nuclear phases of a star -
           building it toward the apocalyptic
           moment that will end Earth's pathetic
           history in one flash of fire.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Devil! Why don't you turn this science
           to peaceful use? The name Ming would
           be blessed instead of cursed.
                         
                          MING
           Bring him up to the dome, Soldiers --
           we wish to show him wonders.
                         
          At that instant a couple of worn-out SLAVES are pitched into
          the magma. Their dying SCREAMS are drowned by the chorus
          from all the minions:
                         
                          EVERYONE

          AURA leads FLASH out through a doorway. He is now fitted out
          with a fairly resplendent MONGO costume: boots, cape,
          headdress and all. They hurry along through shadows. Suddenly
          FLASH seizes her by the shoulders, stops her.
                         
                          FLASH
           Listen, where's he got Dale?
                         
          As she looks at him, she SEES a detachment of SOLDIERS
          marching this direction. Quickly she pulls FLASH into a niche,
          presses her body against his in the narrow space. WHISPERS:

          The SOLDIERS have gone past, but AURA is still pressing
          against him.

           Trust me!
                         
          AURA hauls FLASH from the niche, they hurry on a bit further.
          AURA stops in front of big doors, with glass windows in them.

          (MING, ZARKOV)
                         
          Open at the top to space. But instead of our familiar pinpoint
          stars, here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity,
          their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are
          born and die.
                         
          ZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic
          devices on every side. Most prominent is a huge transparent
          cube, supported in the air above a control console. MING
          moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we HEAR a soft
          intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning
          on the top side of the dome.
           29.
                         
          An astonishing things happens. Inside the cube a recognisable
          greenish globe appears like a three-dimensional holograph,
          slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view
          below a veil of clouds.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Earth!
                         
                          MING
           Yes, Zarkov -- as it was. Now as it
           will be, when my plasma reaches full
           force.....
                         
          A sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN.
          ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys
          again.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           And as it will be in yet another
           time, long after you have died. Earth
           reborn! A pleasant image, no?
                         
          The fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty
          just as it was except that the outlines of our continents
          have been subtly changed.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           But that's impossible! Even your
           perverted genius can't create new
           life!
                         
                          MING
           Of course I can create life. There's
           nothing easier. It only requires
           myself and one woman.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING)
           Dale Arden.....
                         
                          MING
           Who else? As in that childish myth
           of yours -- Adam and Eve, wasn't it?
           I will breed with her and repopulate
           the Earth in my own image. I've
           already done it on over a thousand
           planets.
                         
          MING touches a key. The image of Earth DISAPPEARS from the
          cube. ZARKOV glares hatred at MING for a beat, then his eye
          catches something else.
                         
          WHAT HE SEES
           30.
                         
          A big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded
          in it, just their hilts sticking out.
                         
          ANGLE to include ZARKOV. Chained as he is, he suddenly bounds
          over and seizes a sword hilt, tries to pull it out. It doesn't
          budge.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           The magic blades are not for your
           kind, Zarkov. One is my own the other
           will only be withdrawn by my rightful
           heir. Pull on them with all your
                          MIGHT:
                         
          ZARKOV tugs desperately, but it doesn't give an inch. He
          falls panting over the block.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Monster!
                         
          MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER.
                         
                          MING
           Return him to the dungeon.
                         
          INT. MING'S SERAGLIO
          (DALE, HEDONIA)
                         
          DALE stands amongst the EXOTIC FEMALES of this lavish place,
          being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into
          a diaphanous gown. They intend her no harm. Though each has
          some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful.
                         
          Tickled, DALE can't suppress a giggle. The females are amazed
          and delighted by this phenomenon. They take turns poking at
          her ribs as tall HEDONIA glides up, bearing a flagon of green
          liquid.
                         
                          HEDONIA
           Drink this.
                         
          DALE recoils, her giggling cut short.
                         
                          DALE
           What is it -- some rotten drug?
                         
                          HEDONIA
           It has no name. But many brave men
           died to bring it across space from
           Cythera, planet of Pleasure. It
           will make your hours with Ming more
           agreeable.
                         
          With a karate chop, DALE- knocks the flagon away. HEDONIA
          rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry.
           31.
                         
                          HEDONIA (CONT'D)
           We are of different race, Dale Arden
           but we all are women here. I know
           your fears. Believe me, it will be
           better if you drink it...
                         
          HEDONIA retrieves the flagon from the silken pillow where it
          landed, extends it again to DALE. A shout!
                         
                          DALE
           Flash! Where are you??
                         
          Of course there is no answer. Sudden tears of despair spring
          from DALE'S eyes. She seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks
          it. Her expression changes.
                         
                          DALE (CONT'D)

          panel over which the pilot makes hand-movements to effect
          changes of course and attitude. FLASH is in the left-hand
          seat beside AURA, gazing down at the glittering sight.

          prisoner of the FEMALES who bathe and groom her. She seems

           34.
                         
          A couple of the FEMALES lift DALE'S hands, make a cup of
          them. HEDONIA pours rich oil into it.

          LAUGH softly. Suddenly a FILTERED VOICE is HEARD from nowhere,

          A GUARD stands nearby against a wall, faceless in the shadow

          The GUARD catches his breath, steps toward her lecherously
          to accept the invitation. WHAM! He doubles up as DALE kicks
          him in the groin, goes down without a sound as a left-right-
          left series of KARATE CHOPS hits his neck.
                         
          He is hardly on the floor before DALE is pouncing on the key-

          watching all this with her lips half parted, her tongue
          flicking teeth in supersensuous excitement.
                         
                          BARIN (CONT'D)
           A mere toy of yours, eh?
                         
                          AURA
                          (TAUNTING)
           Maybe I was wrong -- surely the Prince
           of Arboria wouldn't be beaten by a
           toy.
                         
          BARIN snatches a horn from his belt, blows a BLAST.
                         
                          BARIN
           The hunt's on, my Tree Men!
                         
                          TREE MEN

          They run through the green tangle. FLASH trips over a vine.
          TIGER MAN picks him up.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Thank you for freeing me.
           48.
                         
                          FLASH
           You can speak?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           For all the good it does me.
                         
          SOUNDS echo: hunting horns, birdcalls of TREE MEN. They start
          running again.
                         
                          FLASH
           Have we a chance, Tiger Man?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Only if we climb -- out of the green
           light -- to the sky -- Prince Barin's
           Tree Men can't follow us up there!
                         
                          FLASH
           What do you mean?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Ming's Law -- outside his own kingdom,
           every hunter becomes the hunted!
                         
          Ahead is a huge tree made for climbing: branches stick out
          like the rungs of some great green ladder. They leap onto
          the lowest.
                         
          ANGLES - THE TREE - FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Climbing. Jack and the Beanstalk, up and up, panting, but
          there is never a top in sight. Suddenly the branches end.
                         
                          FLASH
           Damn. End of the line.
                         
          TIGER MAN reacts to something off. Touches FLASH'S shoulder
          and points.
                         
          THEIR POV - AT END OF LAST BRANCH
                         
          A crazy sort of ELEVATOR is going by. It's a moving. vine
          with LEAFY BASKETS attached, a vertical conveyor from the
          ground to above. As FLASH and TIGER MAN watch, they SEE one
          basket moving UP with an armed TREE MAN in it, scanning the
          forest below.
                         
                         FLASH
                         
          Snatches the crossbow off TIGER MAN'S back, cocks it, notches
          it quickly with a GLASS ARROW from the quiver.

          FLASH. Letting out a fierce BIRDCALL. he jumps up and swings
          his own crossbow just as FLASH shoots.
                         
          SWISH-PFFST as FLASH'S arrow hits him. ICE, he tumbles out
          of the basket.
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Run out along the branch, jump INTO the basket as it passes
          by.
                         
                          FLASH (CONT'D)
           How far will this take us?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           I don't know --no man has ever been
           above the green.
                         
          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE TREES
          (BARIN, FLASH, TREE MAN, TIGER MAN, TREE MAN LEADER)
                         
          BARIN and a troop of TREE MEN are poised in the branches,
          listening acutely. The one scouting in front calls back:
                         
                          TREE MAN
           The sight -- call came from the left!
                         
          TREE MA.i. The sight-call carne from the left:
                         
                          BARIN
           Up and across we'll cut them off!
                         
          He BLOWS his horn again. The TREE MEN start moving quickly
          some climbing, others SWINGING laterally on vines.
                         
          IN THE BASKET
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Rising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is
          changing, becoming less intensely green.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           What is that color above?
                         
                          FLASH
           Blue. We call is blue.
                         
          A DOZEN TREE MEN come swinging into view on vines, land on a
          fat branch. The LEADER looks right in this direction, points
          and gives a chilling BIRDCALL. The TREE MEN unsling their
          crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS.
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
           50.
                         
          SEEING cold death staring them in the face.
                         
          FLASH reaches for an arrow, notches it.
                         
           TREE MAN LEADER
           You haven't a chance! Throw down
           your weapon!
                         
          FLASH makes like to throw his crossbow away. At the last
          instant, h swings it around, aims and FIRES.
                         
          TREE MEN ON BRANCH
                         
          Are startled as the arrow WHIRRS in and sticks into the branch
          under their feet. The branch instantly turns to ICE.
                         
          BARIN - CLIMBING FROM BELOW
                         
          HEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND. He looks up, gapes,
          holds on tight to the tree trunk. A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN
          plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through
          the branches to doom. A look of fierce delight on his face,
          BARIN resumes his climb.
                         
          EXT. TREETOPS OF ARBORIA
          (FLASH, TIGER MAN)
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf,
          near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around
          a great iron wheel. The forest is open to the sky at this
          altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers. Enormous
          overlapping leaves form a floor FLASH and TIGER MAN can stand
          on.
                         
                          FLASH
           Which way to the border:
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean
           to the west.
                         
          FLASH quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the
          shadows, starts in the direction he estimates is west.
                         
          TREETOPS OF ARBORIA - OTHER ANGLES
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN running over the leaves, which are
          somewhat BOUNCY like a huge trampoline. It's quite enjoyable.
          FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off
          the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next.
                         
          Amazingly, a fat TENDRIL seizes him in mid-air, coils around
          his waist. FLASH yells as he is lifted further up.
                         
          AN ENORMOUS FLOWER
           51.
                         
          is right above him. The closed petals open. The inside is
          viscous, hideous looking. In the deepest recess is a dark
          red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND.
          With horror, FLASH realizes the tendril is feeding him into
          the flower's maw.
                         
          PLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength. TIGER
          MAN dashes to his rescue below, but another tendril knocks
          him flat.
                         
          INT. FLOWER
          (BARIN, FLASH)
                         
          FLASH is conveyed INTO the flower. He punches wildly with
          his fists, kicks, but petals are CLOSING inexorably around
          him. On their inner surface are deadly spiny SPIKES.
          Scattered around are the crushed SKELETONS of luckless TREE
          MEN who have been fed in here.
                         
          SWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying
          past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart. The
          flower SHRIEKS. All around, FLASH, it is turning into
          crystalline ICE.
                         
          The tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below
          beside the TIGER MAN.
                         
          TREETOPS - ANOTHER ANGLE
                         
          As FLASH turns his head to see BARIN standing with his
          crossbow on a leaf some twenty feet away.
                         
                          BARIN
           I saved you because your death must
           be mine.
                         
                          FLASH
           What's the point of all this killing?
           Why don't we team up and overthrow
           Ming?
                         
          BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure
          raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart. Suddenly a SHADOW covers
          BARIN. He jerks his head up to SEE:
                         
          A WINGED SILHOUETTE
                         
          Diving from the sun at him. It is a HAWKMAN, magnificiently
          fierce. It seizes BARIN in its talons and lifts him INTO THE
          AIR.
                         
                         OTHER HAWKMEN
                         
          Hover, their wings beating the air. They dive on FLASH and
          TIGER MAN, lift them too.
           52.

          Put the binoculars down, with one hand lowers the THOUGHT
          TRANSFER hood over her head, with the other waves the craft
          into a sharp turn away from the HAWKMEN. Without her lips

          AURA twists the tuning dial, then goes on in a soft
                         PROVOCATIVE TONE:

                          ZARKOV
           Heaven knows. I was just starting to
           test the primary transformer-banks
                          AND ----
                         
          ZARKOV stops abruptly, looking down at himself. DALE gasps.
                         
                          DALE
           My God -- your hands! Your hands
           are gone!
                         
          It is true: ZARKOV has no hands.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Not gone -- Just invisible. See?
                         
          INVISIBLE HANDS pick up a pebble from the ground, hold it
          before DALE'S nose. Magically, they toss the little object
          back and forth from one UNSEEN HAND to the other. DALE touches
          one, can feel it.

           Does it hurt?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Not a bit. I believe Mongo's
           gravitational. field must have
           reversed the polarity of my generator
           so that --
                         
          He breaks off again. Slowly, in front of our eyes, ZARKOV'S
          HANDS are FADING IN, again and becoming VISIBLE. DALE whistles
          in amazement.
                         
                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)
           Neat trick. I wonder if it's
           controllable?
                         
          SHADOW over them suddenly. Great WHIRRING of wings. DALE
          Looks up and SCREAMS.
                         
                         HAWKMEN
           54.
                         
          Swoop down on ZARKOV and DALE, bear them aloft as they did
          with FLASH AND TIGER MAN.

                         CU MING
                         
          In his wonderous DOME ROOM, watching something. PULL BACK.
          KLYTUS is beside him as usual. ANGLE to include the VIEWING
          SCREEN which MING is watching. On it is a directional
          continuation of the scene we just saw: a struggling DALE
          being Carrie dup into the open sky by HAWKMEN.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Mongo is restless today. Your vessels
           stray from their appointed
           kingdoms....
                         
                          MING
           That damned Vultan -- time I clipped
           his wings once and for all. We could
           put those insolent Hawkmen of his to
           work in the plasma cavern ----
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Dale Arden and Flash Gordon? Will I
           send out the Imperial Fleet to bring
           them back?
                         
                          MING
           We'll let Vultan tame her first --
           I'll look pretty to Dale Arden after
           him. Flash Gordon is nobody.
                         
          KLYTUS smiles that sinister way. MING looks at him
          questioningly.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Sire, it is not for me to tell Great,
           Ming that he is making mistakes.
                         
          EXT. SKY - WIDE SHOT
          (HAWKMAN, TIGER MAN)
                         
          Serried squadrons of HAWKMEN escort the ones bearing FLASH,
          BARIN and TIGER MAN through space.
                         
          CLOSER - TIGER MAN
                         
          Struggling against the TWO HAWKMEN who have him, snarling
          and roaring. He butts one in the belly with his horn.
                         
                          HAWKMAN
           Want us to let you go, et?
           55.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Yes!!
                         
                          HAWKMAN
           Okay.
                         
                          TIGER MAN

          SKY - WIDE PANORAMA
                         
          Light streams rough tremendous El Greco clouds. HAWKMEN Are
          tiny figures, rising against it.
                         
          Higher, higher. Above the clouds a blinding DAZZLE comes
          INTO FRAME. It resolves into a fantastic SKY PALACE hanging
          in mid-air, reflecting sunlight from myriad turrets and
          terraces. The HAWKMEN climb above it.
                         
                         CLOSER HAWKMEN
                         
          Carrying FLASH and BARIN and TIGER MAN , going into a
          screaming dive.
                         
          EXT. SKY PALACE - HAWKMEN POV
                         
          Rushing at us with horrifying speed. ZOOMING DOWN we see a
          dark opening. The wind howling around wings, we rush dizzingly
          into the aperture.
                         
          EXT. SKY PALACE - VULTAN'S EYRIE - A HIGH TERRACE
                         (DALE)
                         
          VULTAN circles admiringly around DALE. VULTAN is a lusty
          viking of the sky, winged like his men, one eye blinded, his
          beard cloven by an old scar from forehead to jaw. Gorgeous
          HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very
          closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom. DALE
          slaps his hand away.
                         
                          DALE
           Watch out, you old bird -- Ming wants
           to marry me.
                         
          VULTAN hoots at that as HAWKGIRLS murmur. He's about to
          touch her again when there is a CLAMOR o.s. VULTAN reacts.
                         
          EXT. SKY PALACE - ANOTHER LEVEL
          (BARIN, DALE, FLASH, SARIN, VULTAN, ZARKOV, ZAAKOV)
                         
          HAWKMEN carrying FLASH, TIGER MAN and BARIN swoop OUT from
          another hole like the one they dove into. The whole place is
          like a great hanging birdhouse, HAWKWOMEN and HAWCHILDREN
          moving in and out and perching on the various exterior
          terraces.
           56.
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Are dropped on to a terrace, so hard it stuns them.
                         
                         BARIN
                         
          Is lowered more carefully on another terrace, this one
          grander, with a throne in the center.
                         
                         FEATURE VULTAN
                         
          Flying down from above, hovering above BARIN with menacing
          glee.
                         
                          VULTAN
           Ho! -- Barin! - I knew my Hawkmen
           would catch you one of these days.
                         
                          SARIN
           Be careful how you address me, Vultan.
           I am Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria.
                         
                          VULTAN
           Not in my Kingdom -- here you're
           just a stray animal to be killed for
           our sport!
                         
                          BARIN
           Will you do that, Vultan?
                         
                          VULTAN
           What would you do if you'd caught me
           in Arboria?
                         
                          BARIN
           Yes -- I would hunt you down and
           kill you without mercy.
                         
          FLASH on the OTHER TERRACE
                         
          Lifts his head groggily, reacts to something. ANGLE TO
          INCLUDE ZARKOV, stumbling out from an opening in his usual
          clothes.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Hello - we do meet in the strangest

                          ZAAKOV
           The boss-bird has her up in his
           57.
                         
          Sudden ear-piercing SCREAM from above. DALE'S scream, FLASH
          bounds to his feet.
                         
          IN THE EYRIE
                         
          DALE is surrounded by jealous HAWKGIRLS who are pushing her
          toward the terrace edge. Screaming again, DALE goes OVER.
                         
          SPACE BETWEEN TWO TERRACES/ ONE TERRACE
                         
          FLASH wheels toward the sound, dives to the parapet and
          catches DALE as she plunges past.
                         
                          DALE
           Flash! Oh darling!

           Dale baby!
                         
          He hauls her in and they embrace in a steamy kiss. FLUTTER
          of wings. HAWKMEN swoop at the terrace and LIFT UP the
          clinging couple. It barely interrupts their conversation:
                         
                          DALE
           Flash -- when I was in that tub --
                         
                          FLASH
           Yes -- it was me --
                         
                          DALE
           Did you mean it?

                          VULTAN
           No. What have you to say to Vultan,

          EXT. SKY PALACE - WIDE SHOT
                         
          Startling sight: A big DISC hangs in the air between the
          curved prongs of a lower terrace, the shaft that supports it
          lost in clouds below.

          ONT HE DISC - A HAWKMAN
                         
          Is GREASING the shiny surface with a mop, slipping around a
          bit as he does so.
                         
                         ANOTHER TERRACE
                         
          SHOTS - ASH AND BARIN getting prepared. Removing shirts being
          equipped with heavy leather gauntlets, and so on. Each is
          given a long vicious WHIP.

          ANGLE - a bridge-like plank extends itself, out over the
          edge of the shiny greased disc. FLASH and BARIN appear, ready
          for combat. HAWKMEN behind them, wthey start out over the
          bridge.

          ON THE DISC
                         
          Razor sharp knives are POPPING UP from the top surface all
          over, maybe two feet apart. If a man loses his footing and
          falls he will surely be fatally impaled.

          Getting his balance again. BARIN moves across amidst the
          knives, takes a stance facing FLASH, raises and coils back
          his whip.

           I ask you to swear, Barin -- if you
           defeat me, you'll join Vultan against
           Ming! If for no other reasons, because
           you'll never have Aura as long as

          ANGLES - FLASH AND BARIN - SPECTATOR REACTIONS
                         
          Suddenly the fight begins. FLASH and BARIN stalk around,
          slipping on the grease, whamming at each other with their
          whips. The disc suddenly begins to TILT and SWAY, making
          this affair even more desperate.
                         
          BARIN begins to get an edge. Slashing, cutting, he drives
          FLASH back.

          the uproar.
                         
          He flies at BARIN, dodges the lash, grapples with him hand-
          to-hand.
                         
          They wrestle their way tot he very rim of the swaying tilting
          surface. It looks bad again for FLASH, when with a superhuman
          effort he flips BARIN over his back... over the edge!
                         
          In the same instant, FLASH dives onto his side amidst the
          deadly knives and grabs at BARIN'S wrist.
           62.
                         
          FLASH catches him. BARIN hangs suspended over the abyss of
          space held only by FLASH'S grip.

          as the work is completed. Capsule door is open. Through it
          we see ZARKOV at work inside, feverishly re-wiring a control
          panel.

          Up on Lodge Balcony, FLASH, BARIN and VULTAN lean over a
          table on which maps and drawings are laid out, a typical
          military staff meeting. With a bit of charcoal, BARIN sketches
          a semi-circular line over a map of MING'S city.
                         
                          BARIN
           A force-field covers the whole city,
           from here to here. With luck, Flash
           can lure them into lowering their
           defenses.
                         
                          VULTAN
           What if he fails?
                          (ABRUPTLY)
           This is suicide, Barin! I can't
           order my men to suicide!
                         
          VULTAN ascends into the air. Hovers as he goes on:
                         
                          VULTAN (CONT'D)
           The flight brought me back to my
           senses -- good luck and goodbye.
                         
                          BARIN
           Ming destroyed your kingdom!

           Let him go -- I understand.
           (up to Vultan)
           Thanks anyway for getting us this
           far!
                         
          VULTAN hesitates a moment, the soars away with determination.

          ZARKOV jumps out, leaving the door open. He crouches low.
          BARIN and VULTAN and EVERYBODY are watching.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Five, four, three, two, one -- ZERO!
                         
          Interior of the capsule is filled with BLINDING BLUE LIGHT
          for an instant. ZARKOV pops up, sticks his head in.

          As INVISIBLE HANDS turn around the helmet on his head.
                         
                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)
           Eureka! I did it! You can come out
           now, Flash --

          ZARKOV moves inside.
                         
                          BARIN
           Look -- he still casts a shadow:
                         
          It's true. FLASH is totally invisible, but on the ground we
          SEE his shadow as he climbs out and stands upright.
                         
          Suddenly there is rising WHINING HUMMING SOUND that seems to
          fill the whole firmament. The earth trembles. LION MEN and
          TREE MEN cower in terror. TIGER MAN roars.
                         
                          BARIN (CONT'D)

           68.
                         
          The SOUND grows louder, intolerable. Brown smoking foliage
          rains down. EVERYONE looks up.

          The topless forest of Arboria is withering, falling apart.
          TREE MEN cry with primal fear as the SEE the sky revealed.
                         
          Hovering against the sun are the dark shapes of MING'S ROCKET
          SHIPS. PULSING RAYS emanate from projectors on their bottoms.
          A VOICE booms from heave:
                         
                          VOICE
           Prisoners of Ming, you are surrounded!

          ONE LION MAN
                         
          Howls in terror, makes a break for cover. A RAY instantly
          zaps down at him and he EXPLODES into fiery fragments.
                         
          BACK TO MAIN PART OF FOREST
                         
          A small SHUTTLE CRAFT descends vertically to a soft landing.
          KLYTUS gets out. Every sound ceases. He nods at BARIN, at
          ZARKOV. Looks around. Frowns. He walks directly across
          FLASH'S SHADOW, to ZARKOV.
                         
                          KLYTUS

           into the glaciers of Frigia.
                         
          DALE shuts her eyes, sobs out:
                         
                          DALE
           Oh Flash -- no -- you can't be dead --
           it doesn't make any sense --

           I don't believe you. You -- you

          Tear runs down AURA'S cheeks. She seizes DALE'S hand, presses
          it against her wonderful breast. DALE is really moved.
                         
                          DALE

           Ming tired of her. He blew my Mother
           into outer space. I look into the
           night sky sometimes and wonder what
           star she's orbiting --

           problems -- that bastard:
                         
          DALE embraces AURA. They cling to each other, bosom against
          bosom, in perfect womanly understanding. Golden CHORDS are
          heard. Doors open. AMAZONS enter.

          KLYTUS frowns. He doesn't notice the SHADOW that suddenly
          passes over him, moves on quickly.

          A RAY GUN - ON A TANK ZAPS out a ray.

          TWO SOLDIERS stand with ray-guns before a heavy locked door.
          Suddenly INVISIBLE FLASH steps behind a flaring torch, casting
          an enormous SHADOW on the wall. He manipulates his caped
          arms so that the image becomes truly fearsome.

          silence, then sound of a KEY IN THE LOCK.
                         
          The door opens itself.

          Everyone watches a big hanging dial. Its needle quivers with

          CONTROLLERS twist the shock-knobs.

          ZARKOV and BARIN just look at him. TIGER MAN slumps out of
          his fighting stance.
                         
          Low door at the back opens itself and INVISIBLE FLASH comes

          way up beside VULTAN, who is engaged in seizing a dominant

          Suddenly MUSIC is heard from below. Some great electronic
          organ booms out the strains of what is recognizably "Here
          Come The Bride".... the familiar thrilling wedding-march.

          A magnificent wedding is on. DALE marches slowly up the
          middle, on KLYTUS'S arm, helped along by AMAZONS who march
          at her back with spears. Her long train passes between the
          AMAZONS to be borne behind by LOVELY GIRLS, as the party
          passes between ranks of splendidly garbed MONGONS.
                         
          An aged HIGH PRIEST waits at the throne-altar with MING,
          whose eyes lecherously devour his approaching bride.

          Earth turns slowly in mid-air, its seas and continents veiled
          by clouds of hideous smoke which seethe with flashes of
          interior red lightning.
                         
          Then FACES come INTO FOCUS below and behind it, and we realise
          we are in MING' S GREAT HALL, where EARTH is a holographic
          image in a transparent box above the altar-throne.

          Standing beside MING at the altar with KLYTUS, looking up
          despairingly at her beloved planet while the HIGH PRIEST
                         INTONES:
                         
                          HIGH PRIEST
           Do you take her, this Earthling,

          KLYTUS produces a golden ring, hands it to MING.
                         
          MING takes DALE'S left hand, forces it up into position,
          holds the ring poised to slip it on. MING'S face has never
          been more merciless.

          An INVISIBLE HAND snatches the ring from MING'S grip like
          lightning and james it onto DALE'S finger.

          and goes down as MING leaps up onto his throne platform.

          catches his breath.

          off by a fiery slash from MING, recovers to bound up higher
          on the vast throne statue wheron they battle.
                         
          PULL UP. In the f.g. the image of EARTH slowly turns and
          glows redder with the lightning inside the clouds.
                         
          BARIN and KLYTUS
                         
          Duel in another area of e Hall. A thrust by BARIN catches
          KLYTUS on the forehead. KLYTUS springs back, blood gushing
          down over his eyes.

          BARIN and KLYTUS
                         
          Fly at each other again, trade blows, then each catches a
          wrist of the other with his free hand. KLYTUS laughs
          horribly.

           foresee my death at your hands --
                         
          KLYTUS twists away, knocks BARIN'S sword out of his grasp,
          drives BARIN back against the wall. KLYTUS lifts his own
          sword, puts it at BARIN'S throat for the final thrust.

          her hand on the hilt of BARIN'S sword, which she has driven
          into KLYTUS' back. Soundless, dead, KLYTUS falls to the floor.
                         
          AURA and BARIN

          The blade goes into MING up to the hilt. FLASH pulls it

          What you have just read is a reproduction of the "1st Draft"
          for the feature film "Flash Gordon". The original source
          material came from a badly deteriorated copy of the original
          script and in some instances dialogue which could not be
          read was guessed upon by best case understanding.
                         
          We have made every attempt to include the integrity of the
          original script, "as-is", to include all original
          descriptions, grammar and spelling. Errors as well.

                          THE FLINTSTONES

    FADE IN:
1   EXT. SLATE QUARRY - DAY                                    1

    FRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his
    faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch
    that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry
    wall.

2   THE QUARRY FOREMAN                                         2
    looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a
    wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time...
    Millerock time!
    Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle
    bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of
    the workday --

                             FRED
               YABBA DABBA DO -- !
    Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the
    canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the
    tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and
    timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only
    motor (his feet), slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur
    to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back
    up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and
    OVER --
                             MUSIC (V.O.)
               'Flintstones,
               Meet the Flintstones,
               They're a modern
               Stone age fam-i-ly --'

    -- And so forth, as for the first time in "his-tor-y" we
    see the Flintstones' OPENING CREDITS live!
4   TIGHT ON A MAILBOX                                         4

    reading "FLINTSTONE." We WIDEN as Fred SKIDS to a halt
    in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A
    moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking
    just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat
    behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the
    saber-toothed cat.
    Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY,
    BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop
    in!
                                              (CONTINUED)

    Fred's feet slap on the street as the car starts
    up --

                               MUSIC (V.O.)
                 'From the
                 Town of Bedrock

5   DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - DUSK                              5

    Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell
    "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his
    car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma.
    (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through
    the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and
    puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN
    ON the drive-in screen and the words that America has
    waited twenty-five years to see in 70mm Dolby(TM) drop-
    your-popcorn reality:
                            THE FLINTSTONES
    And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we --
                                              DISSOLVE TO:
6   AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN                       6

    Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant
    DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from
    a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land.
    (The third one out carries a little suitcase.)

    CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a
    DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange,
    hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then
    WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven-
    foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus.
    It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a
    canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)

    Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs
    over the Xenosaurus.

7   NEW ANGLE                                                  7

    Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize
    that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the
    shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads
    BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE
    EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and
    we see -- Bedrock!
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.

7    CONTINUED:                                                 7
     Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming
     protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light.

     The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills
     out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.

8    WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK                                    8

     It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "WELCOME
     TO BEDROCK" billboard which bears greetings from the
     Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course)
     The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck
     guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and
     trot over the rise, coast down to the street below.
     The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and
     the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --

9    A MILKMAN                                                  9
     who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone
     bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway.
     As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big
     TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise
     nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the
     curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans
     off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.
10   REAR OF TRUCK                                              10
     -- revealing   that the back of the truck is actually a
     giant-jawed   CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The
     garbage men   dump the cans into its maw... it happily
     swallows the   works, licks its lips, BELCHES.
11   BACK TO SCENE                                              11

     The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise, who
     winces as they drive off.
                                TORTOISE
                         (under his breath)
                  You can forget about a tip for
                  Christmas...

     It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn
     timer" box which now pops open.
     Inside the box is a "ROOSTERSAURUS" which CROWS and flaps
     its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two
     round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube
     Goldberg...

                                                          4.

12   FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES                                12
     They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging
     a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn
     spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As
     it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its
     snout.

     Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat
     this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow
     their revolutions. The one closest to the house
     scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.

                             LITTLE MAMMOTH
                      (sotto)
               Oh, my aching sinuses...

13   INT. FLINTSTONES' BEDROOM - DAY                           13

     WIDEN FROM the windowsill, where a little sea shell
     hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS
     "COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO" into the ear of a "CLOCK RADIO
     WOODPECKER." The Woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed,
     puts a timecard in a little clock. Then it turns
     and begins pecking on a BELL, which RINGS PIERCINGLY.

14   INT. BEDROOM - NEW ANGLE                                  14
     Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a
     great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe
     shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge
     GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then
     finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper
     is thrown without aiming --
15   THE WOODPECKER                                            15
     ducks just in time.   It wipes its forehead nervously.

                             RADIO WOODPECKER
                      (sotto)
               I hate this job... There's not
               even a health plan...

     He staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for
     the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not
     to "ALARM" but to "ALARM & RADIO." The WOODPECKER SIGHS,
     looks over at the bed where SNORING is still emanating.
     Then the bird swings a little telescope around to point
     out the window.

     distant stone building marked RADIO STATION B-ROK.

     Perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey
     and an octopus. The monkey holds up cue cards which the
     octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags.
17   BACK TO SCENE                                                 17

     Our WOODPECKER squints, CLEARS his THROAT.

                                RADIO WOODPECKER
                         (deeper "on-air" voice)
                  Good morning, Bedrock. This is
                  station B-R-O-K with the morning
                  weather and news...
18   IN THE BED                                                    18

     The big bulge GRUNTS and MUTTERS a bit, then one hand
     gropes around, finds the curvaceous form under the
     neighboring covers... feels it tentatively... then
     the fingers "walk" upwards...
                                RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.)
                  It will be fair and mild through
                  the weekend, continuing for the
                  next eight hundred years, followed
                  by cooling breezes and a protracted
                  ice age...
     Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the
     covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's
     face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his
     face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.
                                FRED
                         (with genuine charm)
                  Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a
                  great big good morning kiss for
                  your Freddy-weddy?
     And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is
     immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed
     and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.
                                 FRED
                  Dino!   Dino, cut it out -- !

                  In the news, Bedrock civic and
                  business leaders met yesterday to
                  discuss the growing kibble crisis.

                  Ecological activist Ralph Naderock
                  warned that if new supplies of
                  kibble are not found, our animal-
                  powered civilization itself may be
                  threatened.

     By now Dino's affection   attack has knocked both master
     and pet to the floor in   a jumble of bedclothes, asses
     and elbows. Dino begins    to roll Fred across the room
     like a seal playing with   a ball.

                                FRED
                  Dino, that's enough -- here, look,
                  Daddy has a nice dino bone for
                  you, just please stop it --

     Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a
     brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS."
     Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for
     the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes
     out.
     DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.
19   INT. FLINTSTONE KITCHEN - DAY                                 19
     Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and
     Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion.
     Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under-
     stand Fred's romantic turn.
                                RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.)
                  In other news, Bedrock police
                  report that the Xenosaurus has
                  struck again! Yes, the fiercesome
                  intruder was sighted in the
                  Bedrock Hills for the third time
                  this month. Outlying shops and
                  residencies report extensive
                  looting and property destruction...

                                WILMA
                  Fred, stop playing with Dino and
                  sit down. Your breakfast's
                  getting cold.

     Saying this, Wilma puts   a huge egg at Fred's place.
     Meanwhile, Fred manages   to get to his feet, holds out
     one arm to keep Dino at   bay. Fred does a big "take,"
     looking out the window   --

                  Oooh, Dino, look -- there's a
                  nice big dino bone laying out on
                  the front lawn -- !

     Pause.   Dino gives him a big look as if to say, "Oh,
     yeah?"
                                FRED
                         (trying again)

                  little female dino --

     "YI-YI-YI-YI," DINO is out the door like a rocket. Fred
     cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table.
                                FRED
                  -- That animal's gonna kill me
                  with kindness. Do you know we're
                  out of dino treats?
                                WILMA
                  So is everybody else in Bedrock.
                  That kibble crisis is getting
                  worse every day.
     She puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster. Two
     claw-like devices hold the toast, pulling it out of
     sight.
                                WILMA
                  I'm afraid Dino's going to have to
                  manage on leftovers from Pebbles
                  and me.

                                FRED
                         (sitting down)
                  And what's wrong with my leftovers?

                                WILMA
                  I'll let you know when I see

                  gonna get me and eat me up?

                  Of course not, baby.

                  That's right, sweetheart. The
                  only thing that's gonna eat you
                  up is -- me!

     And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her.

                  Pebbles, don't worry. These
                  stories are very exaggerated.
                  Like, you know, the boogyman?
                  There's no such thing as a huge,
                  inhuman reptile that attacks
                  without warning --
     WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window
     and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is
     happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously
     unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the
     slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill,
     looks out.
                                FRED
                  -- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman
                  is here --

     "YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door,
     lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against
     the door.

     Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER
     POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were
     the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit
     who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the
     toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then
     looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.
                                LOBSTER
                  Well, it beats working in a

                  Thanks, Wilma...
     Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then
     something outside the window catches his eye.

20   HIS POV - STREET                                              20
     A paperboy on a wood-and-stone bicycle is coming rapidly
     towards the house. In the bike's basket is a stack of
     dried, rock-hard clay tablets.
21   BACK TO SCENE                                                 21

     Fred leans out the window, waving his hands.

                                FRED
                  Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at
                  the house -- please, not at the
                  house --
     WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams
     into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out
     a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the
     kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this
     action in time to see --

     The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the
     canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent
     in the hood.

     Fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast.

                                WILMA
                  Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.

                          (slight smile)
                  Yeah.   What else can go wrong?

     He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing
     a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps, knocking Fred
     over as it takes off through the window.

     In the neighboring driveway, Wilma and Betty pile the
     kids into Betty's car.

                                BETTY
                         (wiping their mouths)

                         (as Wilma clears
                          her throat)
                  'Bye, big sweetheart.

     Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs,
     tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to
     stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news-
     paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of
     course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS
     STRIKES AGAIN.

     Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its
     mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but
     the voice is that of --
                                BARNEY
                  Nice morning, huh, Fred?
                                FRED
                  What's nice about it?

                                BARNEY
                  Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a
                  real arm on him, don't he?

     Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff
     legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the
     hedge.

                                FRED

                  Yeah, I know, I know, those
                  crazy inventions of yours. Be
                  honest with me, Barn... tell me
                  one thing you invented that
                  really caught on.

                  I invented fire.

                                BARNEY
                  I told you that, Fred. But the
                  coal conglomerate ripped me off.
                  The case is still in court, but
                  meanwhile I got lotsa other
                  ideas --
                                FRED
                  Yeah, but did any one of them
                  ever put bread on the table? How
                  long are you and Betty gonna live
                  on those penny-ante royalties you
                  get?

     Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges,
     examines it with dismay.

                                FRED
                  If you ask me, pal, you're just

                                 BARNEY
                  Maybe, Fred.   But first...

     He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood
     from Fred's surprised grasp.
                                BARNEY
                  Let me try some of that smoke on
                  your car.

25   INT. BARNEY'S GARAGE/WORKSHOP - DAY                         25
     We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway.
     (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a
     bit more, then collapses from exhaustion).
     Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and
     ends, plus various inventions and scale models in
     different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a
     number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work).
     Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green
     material.

     Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood
     into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
                               BARNEY
                        (as he works)
                 -- See, the first step, we make
                 a mold of the old car hood, smooth
                 out the dent in the clay --
     He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash.
     Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of
     ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.

                               BARNEY
                 -- Add some lava granules... some
                 woca leaves... juice from two
                 coo-coo berries...

                               FRED
                        (impressed)
                 Two coo-coo berries?   You made of
                 money, Barney?

                               BARNEY
                 Anything for a pal, Fred -- a
                 lump of coal... bamboo sawdust...
                 eucalyptus sap... a touch of the
                 La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila.
     Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it;
     satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock
     weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out
     of his skin.

     Fred is caked with dust.   He coughs and spits.
                               FRED
                 Barney, why don't you try inventing
                 a brain for yourself! Look at what
                 you did to --

     proudly lifts out a perfect (though greenish) duplicate
     of the car hood. As Fred examines it, impressed despite
     himself, we...

     The two kids are in the back seat. Somehow both of the
     kids' faces are messy again. Working together with
     beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the
     rear armrests and door handles.

                  Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but...
                  well, he's just not cut out to punch
                  a clock. And he's such a dreamer,
                  you think he ever once picked up a
                  hammer and chisel and tried to
                  balance a checkbook?
     They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little
     nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees
     them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un-
     load the kids.
                                BETTY
                  No, Barney just keeps looking for
                  that coo-coo berry pie in the sky,
                  and I don't want to pop his balloon
                  by talking about the price of
                  mastodon ribs.

     She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma
     does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids,
     who immediately run into the schoolyard.

                                MRS. GRANITE
                         (approaching)
                  Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I
                  wanted to thank you personally.

                                BETTY
                  You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But
                  we wipe their mouths every day.

                                MRS. GRANITE
                  No, no, I mean for all your wonderful
                  support the past few years. It's
                  parents like you that make me think

     From the schoolyard comes the sudden sound of KIDS QUAR-
     RELING and then a THUD and some CRYING.

                                MRS. GRANITE
                  On the other hand...

     Wilma and Betty laugh.

                                WILMA
                  We're really going to miss you,
                  too, Mrs. Granite.

                                MRS. GRANITE
                  Have you found another school for
                  the children?

                                BETTY
                  We're still shopping around.
                                WILMA
                  Fortunately, we're both --
     Wilma and Betty straighten... salute.

                          routine before)

     Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same
     houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm...
     split level, two palms... duplex, palm).
     Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.

                                BARNEY
                  Not bad, eh? After it cures for an
                  hour or so, it's solid as a rock.

                                FRED
                  Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But
                  you call that a living? Face it,
                  pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's
                  a dino eat dino world. You want my
                  advice?

                                BARNEY

                  You stick with me today, cruise on
                  down to the quarry and fill out a
                  job application. I'm a big man
                  there, Barney --

                                BARNEY
                  You're a big man anywhere, Fred --
                                FRED
                  I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate
                  are just like this --
     He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers...
     ends up swerving instead.

                                FRED
                  -- just like that. I know, I know
                  -- you're not a clock-punching guy
                  -- but face it, Barney -- it's time
                  to grow up and put your nose to the
                  grindstone, batten down the hatches
                  and join the ratasaurus race with
                  the rest of us.
                         (meaningfully)
                  It's time to retire those dreams.
     Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.    Suddenly Fred
     pulls over, stops the car.
                                 FRED
                  Barney.   Look.

     They're at the crest of a high wide hill.

                                 BARNEY
                  Hey.   Lava Lane.
                                FRED
                  Remember the old days, Barn? We
                  used to race our go-carts here to
                  impress the girls.

                                BARNEY
                         (wistful)
                  Yeah, those were the days... we
                  usta dream about coming back here
                  some day with a real car and goin'
                  for the goldrock...!

     A look from one to another, and then down the hill...
     Fred gets a malicious grin on his face.

                               FRED
                  Hey. Since when do I have to be
                  consistent?

     The two pals laugh, and then    with a whoop they begin
     pedalling like mad. They go     over the top, gravity takes
     over and they are flying past    that billboard with all the
     Rotary Club welcomes on it.     But now we see a different
     sort of welcome, as a POLICE    CAR ZOOMS out from behind it.
30   POLICE CAR - CLOSER                                            30

     Inside are SERGEANT FELDSPAR and his rookie partner,
     OFFICER GRAVEL. Cackling with anticipation, Feldspar
     opens a box marked radar detector. Out pops a little
     bird in a police helmet. It has a stopwatch (actually,
     stop-sundial) around its neck. Feldspar points -- the
     bird salutes -- takes off!
31   FRED AND BARNEY                                                31

                        (spotting the cops)
                  Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !

     Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying
     alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note
     to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice
     as --

32   THE POLICE CAR                                                 32
     cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits
     helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.
                                FELDSPAR
                  Well, Flintstone, looks like today's
                  the day.
                                FRED
                  Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't
                  speeding... honest...

     Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks...
33   ANGLE ON FLOORBOARD                                            33

     There's a box there marked RADAR BUSTER.

                                FELDSPAR (O.S.)
                  Forget it, Flintstone. This time
                  I got you dead to rights --
     Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile
     sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.

34   BACK TO SCENE                                                    34
     Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird,
     turns to his rookie partner.

                                FELDSPAR
                  Gravel. Get me the radar reading
                  and I'll show you how we deal with
                  scofflaws.

     Gravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks
     its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard
     which is hovering nearby, licking its lips.
                                 RADAR BIRD
                  Whoa!   Wings, do your stuff -- !

     The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour,
     leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind.
     Feldspar catches the watch, startled.
                                FRED
                  Well, Sergeant, if you don't have
                  a radar reading, I guess we'll --
                         (quickly)
                  -- justbeonourway -- !

     A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away.
                                 FELDSPAR
                  Flintstone!   Flintstone, come back
                  here -- !

     Betty and Wilma   have just pulled up. We notice that next
     to their legal   spot, a big limousine is parked in a "no
     parking" zone.    But our law-abiding Betty in the next
     space now drops   a stone coin in a parking meter.

     coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer.

     It's absolutely   mobbed. Customers push past each other
     with armloads of   food. Gigantic cuts of meat hang from
     above or are on   display behind the counter. MORRIS THE

     Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break

                  Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate.

     blank look.

                  now --
                                MRS. SLATE
                  I don't care if you're busy. What
                  I care about is my adorable little
                  grand nephew. He's staying with
                  me for the summer and I intend to
                  make his favorite dish... Southern
                  fried chickensaurus! Now I want
                  a fresh chickensaurus and I want
                  it now!
                                MORRIS
                  Boys, you heard her... she said
                  fresh.

     with a sigh, they buckle on elbow and knee protectors,
     go to a side door, open it. Inside is another barred
     door. They open it, go inside. Immediately we hear
     loud SQUAWKING and CACKLING... THUDS, BUMPS...

     Suddenly the barred door slams open and a      giant chicken-
     saurus comes bounding out, with Morris's      staff hanging
     all over it like rodeo cowboys. They try       and restrain
     it with ropes but it's enraged and flops      around the
     store.

                                MRS. SLATE
                         (oblivious of the
                          trouble)
                  Morris, while you're at it, I'd
                  like it plucked --

     Suddenly the chickensaurus snaps the ropes, flaps its
     wings and leaps through the front window --

41   EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                                      41
     The huge bird lands with a crunch atop Mrs. Slate's car,
     which is practically squashed flat. Then it disappears
     around the corner. (We hear CAR HORNS and SKIDDING TIRES
     as it goes.)

     Wilma and Betty try and hide their laughter.

43   EXT. SLATE CONSTRUCTION - DAY                                43
     Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the
     heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling.
     A two-story office building is at one end of the site
     with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof.
     CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney
     seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the
     morning light.

     Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He
     gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various
     workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these,
     beaming in the respect he gets here.

     He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on,
     knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F.
     Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the
     quarry area.

                                FRED
                  Barney, you won't regret this --
                  hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars
                  is one thing, a career's another.
                  Here, you're getting in on the
                  ground floor of the first footstep
                  of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's
                  the old backhand? And with a guy
                  like me ta show you the ropes, you
                  can skip all the red tape, all the
                  malarky, all the dino doo --

     Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump
     GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.

                 Hi, Mr. Flintstone.

                 Hiya, Shirley. This is my very
                 special neighbor and pal Barney
                 Rubble. He needs an application
                 form, okay?
                               GIRL
                 Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.

     She slams down two clay tablets and a stylus.
                               GIRL
                 Here you go.
                        (smiling)
                 Thanks again for the football tickets.
                 My boyfriend and I both liked them.

                               FRED
                 My pleasure, Shirl.    Anytime.
                               GIRL
                 Okay. But do you think next time
                 we could go to the same game?
                               FRED
                        (confidently)
                 No problem.
     Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps
     towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips,
     master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
                               FRED
                 Well, Barn, what did I tell you?
                 When you're in with Flintstone,
                 you're in like Flint.
                              BARNEY
                 Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big
                 shot. I just didn't know how big.
     Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to
     the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it
     and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's
     sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the
     CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the
     Slate Construction Office.

46   INT. OFFICE - PULLBACK FROM WINDOW                        46
     The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural
     model of a large scale construction project. There's
     acres of little development houses, then some tall office
     buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot-
     powered model cars in the model parking spaces.

     Near this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con-
     struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks
     coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience
     to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their
     heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer-
     curial moods.
                             LAVA
               Uncle, if you'll look at this unit
               cost projection... it intersects
               here with --
                             SLATE
               -- how'd you like my fist to
               intersect with your nose? I've
               told you a hundred times, don't call
               me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't
               arrange your scholarship to Harvrock
               University so you could waste my time!
               So stop beating around the bushasaurus
               and get to the bottom slime!
                             LAVA
               You'll be bankrupt in six months.
     Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model.
47   EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT                                 47
     Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers
     and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving.
     Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them,
     we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the
     quarry's sides.

48   FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR                     48
     A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in-
     side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and
     then propels his wrecking ball towards the...

     balanced on a boulder.

50   WIDER                                                        50
     Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps  up the
     walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one   in place.
     (It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi-
     cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of
     our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney.)

                             PYRITE
               Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks
               says you can't hit one on the fly.

                             PILTDOWN
                      (calling up)
               Yer on, Pyrite --
     Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge.    The
     wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall.

     People grab for their construction helmets.

               Not again...
     Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to
     the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.
                             FRED
               All right, Piltdown, that's enough!
               You're endangering your fellow
               workers!

                              PILTDOWN

               us workers a snack break. So...
                      (a nasty grin)
               ... I'm breakin' some snacks.

     He swings the wrecking ball again.

     This time he's overdone it:   The wrecking ball flies past
     the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks  for cover -- and then the
     wrecking ball whips over and  around the handrail which
     runs along here, twisting as  tightly as Indiana Jones'
     whip. The handrail wobbles   dangerously in its
     foundation --

     runs to grab the dino's reins.

                              FRED
                Whoa, whoa, big fella --
     He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches,
     Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
                              FRED
                       (calling up to the cab)
                You're on report, Piltdown! If it's

                  Come on, guys. Let's clean up the

     With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are

                  It's all here in hack and slice.
                  When you committed to this housing
                  development the price of dino kibble
                  was a few clams per ton. Since then,
                  it's gone up a hundredfold.
                         (indicating the model)
                  You can't build a project like this
                  without the heavy equipment dinos,
                  and we can't afford to feed those
                  dinos.

     Slate glowers, paces around the model.

                  Sounds like a worker's comp claim
                  if I ever heard one...

     All rush to the window.       They look out and see --
58   THE QUARRY - WIDE                                               58

     Supervised by   Fred, all    the workers are straining on the
     ropes to haul   the rear    legs of the crane back into their
     sockets on the   back of    the big dino. Only the last
     critical rope   is still    dangling.

                                 FRED
                  Barney!   Grab that line!   Hurry!
     Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's
     face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it...
     Fred throws his own weight into the effort...

59   THE CRANE                                                       59
     THUDS into place on the dino's back -- the workers cheer --
60   THE WRECKING BALL                                               60
     alas, with its cable now twisted shorter, it's become an
     immovable object, and as the shortened CABLE SNAPS, the
     wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall.

61   NEW ANGLE                                                       61
     Men and ANIMALS YELP and dive out of the way as the BALL
     rolls downwards, SMASHING everything in its path.
62   EXT. SLATE'S OFFICE WINDOW                                      62

     The executives watch concerned as --
63   THE WRECKING BALL                                               63

     tumbles down, down, knocking scaffolding and ladders
     aside, reaches the end of a ramp, and drops through the
     air right onto --
64   THE HOOD OF FRED'S CAR                                          64

     -- where, astonishingly, the HOOD sinks in resiliently
     like a trampoline and then with a loud "SPROING" the
     wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air,
     followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself.
     Both hurtle TOWARDS the CAMERA --

                                                             28.

     react fearfully as they realize all this is coming
     straight for them. With a howl, they all dive aside --

     The wrecking BALL flies through the window, SLAMS onto
     Slate's desk, crushing everything in its path and then
     sails on SMASHING right into --
67   THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT                                         67

     a sound like falling pins.

     The workers pick themselves up and now their eyes follow
     the path taken by the long-gone wrecking ball.
                               FRED
               Oh boy.    Goodbye pension fund --
     They rush for the office building.

69   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                     69
     Dust is still settling. The staff rises from the mess,
     coughing. Lava rummages in the debris, finds a stiff
     body.
                             LAVA
               Uncle, Uncle, speak to me --

               I'm over here, you moron -- and
               don't call me 'Uncle'!

     Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a
     bookshelf. He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays
     put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster
     which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams
     open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside.

     the last remaining little HIGH RISE FALLS.

     Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He
     finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES
     in his hands like a hand saw.

     falls on Fred's foot. Fred starts to scream and Piltdown
     shoves a pencil holder into his mouth.

     As elegant as we can get MMMCXV years before Louis XIV.
     As the three women come in, we see CHILDREN with alliga-
     tors on their deerskin shirts singing:

                  Madame Mrs. Slate, bonjour!
                  Welcome to L'ecole des Enfants

                                MRS. SLATE
                  Thank you, Marie.
                         (showing a rock receipt)
                  I ordered the hors d'oeuvres for
                  the junior talent show. They were
                  out of Ceolanth caviar so I got
                  Mastodon brie instead. Oh, ah,
                  these are my, uh, friends, Wilma
                  Flintstein --

                  -- oh, it used to be Flintstein -- ?
                  And this is ah, Becky... Betty!

     The Headmistress reaches over, takes their hands
     gracefully.
                                  HEADMISTRESS
                  Enchante.

                         (waving a hand)
                  Well, Madame Slate, as you can see,
                  we remain ze creme de la creme in
                  the croissant of life known as
                  Bedrock. Now, your leetle gran'

     Mrs. Slate takes the parchment application. Meanwhile
     the Headmistress looks appraisingly at Wilma and Betty.
                                HEADMISTRESS

                         (amused)
                  Them? Oh, Marie, really, you don't
                  understand --

                                BETTY
                         (suddenly)
                  That's right, you don't understand.
                  My husband's business manager usually
                  handles this sort of thing, but I
                  don't mind.
     And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the
     parchments.
                                BETTY
                  I know Bam-Bam --

                  in the talent show. Thank you oh
                  so much.

     She gives Mrs. Slate an even and controlled look, and
     sends some of it over in Wilma's direction as well.
     Wilma makes her choice, smiles tightly.

                                WILMA
                  Let me have one of those, too.   For

74   INT. CAR - FRED AND BARNEY - NIGHT                             74
     They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney
     flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the
     back seat are some boxes and bundles.
                                BARNEY
                  Gee, Fred, I don't believe it.
                  Eight hours ago I didn't have a
                  job and now look -- I got 1/2 of
                  one percent of the after-taxes
                  after-expenses net breakage profits
                  on Fibrerock!
                                FRED
                  Just be thankful I was there to go
                  over the fine print.
                         (full of himself)
                  It's like I told you this morning
                  -- There's something noble about a
                  man digging in with his hands and
                  doing an honest day's work. Once
                  you file those dreams under 'old
                  business' and put your nose to the
                  plow, well, the world is your
                  oyster. And was I right?
                                BARNEY
                  No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't
                  nose any grindstones and you didn't
                  shoulder a wheel. We just hung out
                  together and everything that
                  happened was a total accident.

                                FRED
                         (after a moment)
                  Details, Barney, details...
                         (smiling)
                  I just can't wait to see the girls'
                  faces when we tell 'em the news...
75   INT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                                  75

     The girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands'
     smiles. Wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms.
     Betty paces, looks at the clock.

                  It's not like the boys to be so
                  late.
                                BETTY
                  Unless they were forced to go
                  bowling again. Remember that time
                  a burglar pointed a gun at them
                  and said, 'go bowling right now'?

                                WILMA
                  Betty, sometimes you're a little
                  too gullible --

                         (indicating the forms)
                  Do you have any idea of what the
                  enrollment fee is? And get this...
                  it's non-refundable --
                                BETTY
                  I know, I know! I just couldn't
                  stand that woman's attitude! But
                  we had to find a new school anyway,
                  and there we were... the next thing
                  I knew, I was in over my head...
                  but why did you jump in, too?

                                WILMA
                  Oh, she was getting to me too with
                  all that mastodon snort about her
                  little nephew... and...
                               BETTY

                  And... if a friend can't help you

     Betty smiles, touched.    Then reality intrudes again.

                  What do we tell the boys?

                                                   CUT TO:
77   EXT. WATER BUFFALO LODGE - NIGHT                              77
     A sign proclaims this as "GRAND BEDROCK LODGE -- LOYAL
     ORDER OF WATER BUFFALO." The parking lot outside is full
     of vehicles. We hear the sound of a GAVEL BANGING...
                                HERDMASTER (V.O.)
                  Attention, fellow Water Buffaloes...
78   INT. WATER BUFFALO LODGE - NIGHT                              78

     The members are milling about the main room, schmoozing,
     drinking, kibitzing. All wear the furry and horned
     ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo.

     One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge
     coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below);
     a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various
     bowling trophies, balls and pins. At the lectern, the
     HERDMASTER (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs
     again for order.
                                HERDMASTER
                  Brothers, your attention!

     It quiets a bit. He clears his throat, raises his chin,
     and gives a strange mournful bellow.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                         ("ritual" type tone)
                  The herd is now called to the
                  prairie.
                         (holding fingers
                           above ears)
                  Antlers... up!

     The entire Lodge dutifully imitates this gesture.
                                ENTIRE GROUP
                  Ack-ack-a-dack!

                  This meeting of the Water
                  Buffaloes is now in session.
                  Sergeant-at-Arms, have we got any
                  old business?
     Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge
     brothers.
                                BARNEY
                  Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster.
                  Tonight we are to hear speeches
                  from prospective candidates for
                  Lodge offices, such as good old
                  Fred and some other guys.
79   PILTDOWN                                                    79
     Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he
     immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives
     an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier
     call to order.

80   BACK TO SCENE                                               80
     After the CRY ECHOES away:

                                HERDMASTER
                  Brother Piltdown: You have given
                  the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at
                  the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you
                  wish to file an objection?

                                PILTDOWN
                  You bet I do. How come Flintstone
                  is 'good old Fred' and me and the
                  other candidates are just 'some
                  other guys'?
                                PYRITE
                  Yeah, how come?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                         (rising)
                  My apologies, Brother Piltdown.
                  Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we
                  will hear speeches from a whole
                  bunch of good old guys...
                         (pause)
                  ... plus the one and only Fred
                  Flintstone!
     Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of
     the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium
     as the noise dies down.
81   NEW ANGLE                                                   81

     Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up
     tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it
     to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big
     "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster.
     Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does,
     Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his
     pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches
     up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it,
     continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands
     Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each
     other like a Pharaoh's badges of office.

     Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down,
     and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.

                  Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and
                  Apprentice Antlers, a great good
                  evening to you all. Ahem. As you
                  know, our organization has survived
                  difficult times that have seen the
                  extinction of such other lodges as
                  the Order of Whooping Cranes and
                  Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But
                  we here have come through the croo

                  many problems. As your next
                  Herdmaster, I would bring to you
                  the same determination, courage
                  and -- if I may say so -- bold
                  thinking that I have brought to
                  the workplace. Thank you, and
                  ack ack a-dack.
     Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.

     The only ones in their row not clapping, they scowl as
     Fred passes them...

     WIDEN as Barney propels   a bowling ball (stone, of course)
     rumbling down the alley,   sending pins flying. The
     Buffaloes cheer Barney's   strike. We notice that most (if
     not all) of these Lodge   members also work at the quarry.

84   AUTOMATIC PIN SPOTTER                                        84
     It descends.    It consists of a bent snout creature which
     "cranks" down   a shelf with several monkeys on it. The
     monkeys grab   the pins with their tails, straighten them
     up. Then the    shelf cranks back up.
85   OTHER END OF ALLEY                                           85

     Now it's Fred's turn. He trots up to the line, bowls...
     another strike! More cheers, AD LIB complaints, etc.
     The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out
     the last frame.
                                LODGE MEMBER
                  Congratulations, Fred.

                  Hey, when you're hot you're hot...
                  boys, lemme buy a round of drinks
                  for everyone.

                                BARNEY
                  Thanks, Fred, but here at the
                  lodge drinks are free.

                  But the principle is the same,
                  Barn. Don't forget that.
     Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and
     Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew?
     Fred reaches --

86   UNDER THE COUNTER                                            86
     where he pulls out a hook-beaked little LIZARD --

     Fred uses this creature to open several beers.

                  Go ahead, laugh. If I had a good
                  orthodontist, my life woulda been
                  different...
     Fred tosses the "Opener" aside --

88   UNDER THE COUNTER                                            88
     The critter bounces into the shelf, slides... when it re-
     covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened
     out by the impact. Very happy, it grabs a hat and coat,
     exits.

     It's actually "dots" chipped into a stone. It shows the
     young Fred, Barney and others gathered around soapbox
     racers. A banner reads "Junior Buffalo Day."

               Fred, what was all that stuff in
               your speech about the workplace?
               I thought the only decision you
               made there was how many lunches to
               eat --
     Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into
     his pocket.
                             FRED
               Well, Harry, it just so happens
               that old Fred is moving up in the
               world... Boys, you're looking at
               Mr. Slate's new partner.

               You and Slate? Who are you
               kidding, Flintstone? The only
               partner you got is hanging over
               your belt.
     Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.

               Yes, boys, you see, I went up to
               my pal, Mister Slate and single-
               handedly made him an offer he

     Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near
     a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with
     a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for
     "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs";

                 Fred... what's this single-handed
                 stuff? I distinctly remember at
                 least four hands and two of them
                 were mine.

                               FRED
                        (lowered voice)
                 Barney, we could tell everyone how
                 you invented this Fibrerock stuff,
                 how Slate and Lava found out about
                 it by accident and all, but what
                 would that be?
                              BARNEY
                 The truth?
                               FRED
                 This is big business, Barney. We
                 can't start telling the truth,
                 it'd create the wrong impression.
                 Think about all the really big
                 deals in history -- back to the
                 beginning of recorded time.
     Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
                              BARNEY
                 Okay.
                                FRED
                 What do they all have in common?
                        (as Barney is
                          stumped)
                 I'll tell you. A front man. A
                 guy who's out in the public eye
                 running the point, fighting the
                 crowds... and meanwhile... back
                 in the corner is the silent
                 partner.

                               BARNEY
                 I never knew that.

                               FRED
                 That's because the silent partner
                 is always silent.

                  It looks like my mind, but you're

                                BARNEY
                  I get it. I got the brains, but
                  you just pretend to have them.

     Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the
     neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out,
     calls to her husband.

     He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear-
     ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty
     fixes the knot.
                                BETTY
                  There. That looks more like a
                  captain of industry.
                                BARNEY
                  Thanks, Betty. What would I do
                  without you?

                                BETTY
                  Hmm. Probably run off to the

                  executive secretaries.

                  Fred! Wait a minute! There's
                  something wrong with your lunch --

                  Yeah... it does feel a little
                  light...
     He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find
     it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly
     presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is
     embossed on it in gold.
                                WILMA
                  Fit for a king... my king.

                  Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got
                  buckles, a strap, a lock --
     He opens it.    Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.
                                FRED
                  -- Baby, you're the greatest.

                   -- what? When did that happen?
      Piltdown enters, knocks on the open door.

                   Mister Lava, the armored car is

                   Yeah. Must be a fortune in
                   coo-coo berries on that baby.
                   You know, for that Fibrerock
                   stuff of Flintstone and Rubble's.
                   You gotta sign here for it.

                Piltdown, this Fibrerock program
                is going to create a lot of
                changes around the plant. I want
                to make one more. You've been a
                wonderful thug and goon for me.
                Now, I'd like to expand your
                duties. I want you to become a
                provocateur.

                you to double-cross your Lodge and
                Union brothers, and make their
                lives a living hell.

      over the quarry scrap heap. (As we watch, somebody dumps
      a load of debris.)
      Threadbare furniture on a worn rug sits under a portrait
      of "Our Founder" (Slate).

      Fred and Barney look at all this in turn.     Pause.    Then
      they whirl, give each other high-fives.

                   All-right!

                                 FRED

      And as they shake, we --
                                                    CUT TO:

106   MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY                                  106

      Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we
      see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation.

      This cannot be described    now with appropriate justice,
      but it involves a series    of animal-powered conveyor
      belts, Rube Goldberg-like    funnels, spouts and chutes,
      and all sorts of gadgets,    gizmos, bells and whistles,
      to wit:
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             53.

106   CONTINUED:                                                    106
      At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and
      lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/
      chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is
      then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with
      water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill-
      type trough and is held back by a gate.

      Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone
      sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which
      butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of
      a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed
      aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam
      trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to
      "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts --

                                 BARNEY
                   Ready... aim... fibre!
      Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.     "Fibrefoam"
      pours into the mold.
107   THE CLAY MOLD                                                 107
      gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga-
      torsaurus whaps it with its tail.
108   BELOW                                                         108
      Presto! A Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly
      out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt
      below! It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green
      shimmer of Fibrerock. As     it chugs along, the process
      repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view.

109   END OF ASSEMBLY LINE                                          109
      as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the
      Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see
      Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc.
110   UP ANGLE - SLATE'S OFFICE BALCONY                             110

      Slate and Lava watch the progress, dollar signs in their
      eyes.

      Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching
      away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kane's
      warehouse.
      We see everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock
      table lamps to Fibrerock toilets. MUSIC OUT.

                                                            54.

112   CLOSER - QUARRY YARD                                        112
      Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands
      as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary,
      but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about
      to address them from his office balcony.
                              SLATE
                Men, this is a proud day for Slate
                Construction. You have seen the
                first pieces of Fibrerock roll
                off the assembly line and into
                history... a history you are all
                part of... thanks to your very
                own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone!
113   WORKERS - FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY                          113

      They cheer Slate's remarks, pat Fred on the back.

                              SLATE
                No longer will man and beast bend
                under the backbreaking load of
                stone and rock and timber...
                because Fibrerock is so light
                that even a child can handle it.
                       (pause)
                That's why on Monday we're going
                to hire two dozen children from
                Bedrock Technical Junior High.
                They'll be replacing the 36
                heavy equipment operators, 15
                shaft diggers and 22 laborers
                we're laying off today. Your
                pink slips will be in your final
                pay envelopes along with a ticket
                to the grand opening of Slate
                City. It's non-transferable,
                so hang on to it. Thank you, and
                have a nice weekend.

                   steward are you?
      All eyes swivel and bore into Fred, who is as shocked as
      anyone.

                                BARNEY
                   Fred. You gotta do something
                   about this!

                   I do?
                          (realizing)
                   I mean, I do, yeah!

      He squares his shoulders, marches off.

                          (proudly)

116   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                    116

      Slate is practicing    hitting golf balls into an automatic
      putting cup. Lava     and some office workers are checking
      a blueprint against    a model of "Slate City" which is made
      out of Fibrerock.     A ball shoots back at Slate, who tees
      up again.
117   INSIDE THE PUTTING CUP                                       117
      A little MOUSE in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch
      the ball. Stopping it with his little hockey stick, the
      Mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask.
                                  MOUSE
                   Whew.   And it's still pre-season.
      He whaps the ball to Slate again.


118   BACK TO SCENE                                                118
      Slate tees up the ball again. Fred barges in, banging
      the door. Startled, Slate drives the ball instead of
      putting it. It sails across the room and SHATTERS a
      PICTURE of Mrs. Slate.

                   Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --
                                  SLATE
                   We do, eh?   About what?

                                 FRED
                   About those guys outside, Mr.
                   Slate. Some of 'em, well, they
                   been here for years. And you,
                   well, you can't lay them off just
                   like --
                          (snapping fingers)
                   -- that!

      Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs. Slate looks back at
      Fred, stays surprisingly calm. He toys with the putter,
      balances it on his palm.
                                 SLATE
                   Of course I can, Fred. I can lay
                   them off like --
                          (snapping fingers)
                   -- that, or like --
                          (a different style
                           snap)
                   -- that, or like --

      He does a really nifty snap which combines with a buck-
      and-wing with the putter.
                                 SLATE
                   -- that.

                          (bravura slipping)
                   Oh, you can, huh?
                                 LAVA
                   Of course he can, Flintstone.
                   It's his quarry.
                                 SLATE
                          (still calm, warm)
                   That's right. Why --
                          (chuckling)
                   I could lock the front door and go
                   fishing if I wanted!

      Lava laughs along with the office staff and Slate.      Fred
      chuckles a little to fit in.

      Lava quivers with mock surprise.     Everyone really laughs,
      now.

                          (wiping away a tear)

                   Slate, that's --
      Suddenly Fred stops laughing.
                                 SLATE
                   Flintstone, Lava, here,
                   recommended that you be in charge
                   of public relations to get
                   Fibrerock off to a good start.
                   I'm a member of that public,
                   Flintstone, and I have to say...
                   this isn't a good start. I'm
                   getting a bad feeling about
                   Fibrerock. A bad feeling about...
                   you. You want that feeling to go
                   away, don't you?
                                 FRED
                   Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah.
                                 SLATE
                   Good. Then turn around and walk
                   out of here and we'll forget all
                   about this.

      Fred swallows, looks at Lava, goes meekly out.

                   Young lady, this is not about
                   beating pants, this is about
                   becoming a well rounded child.
                   Now, what kind of act will you do?

                                 BAM-BAM
                   How about a disappearing act?
      He takes a tentative step away but Betty grabs him.

                   We're waiting.
      Pebbles and Bam-Bam sigh, huddle.       We hear snatches of
      discussion...

           that thing with Dino?           think so...?
      Pebbles turns, the decision made.

                                PEBBLES
                   Okay. We're gonna sing a song
                   with Dino.
      Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a
      straw hat and a cane.
      Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical. Bam-Bam
      reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle. He blows
      it --

      MUSIC comes UP and Dino and his little friends do a dance
      routine we will call "The Dino Dance." It is a spectac-
      ular blend of soft-shoe and the kind of dog-and-pony-show
      gags usually seen in the circus or on the Ed Sullivrock
      show. Most importantly, the routine includes the
      following:

      A)    Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop.

      B)   The kids tie down a jump rope and Dino does a wire
           walk.

      C)   And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto
           his back, culminating in a big "ta-da" after they all
           slide down the rope for a big finish.

      Pause as Fred waits for a reply. He turns... SHOT WIDENS
      as he realizes no one is sitting near him. He looks
      around and sees --

      It's been altered to read "Fred Finkstone." Also added
      to Fred's image are horns, a beard and other choice
      touches.

      Fred looks around, sees Barney approaching, having just
      left a group of angry Buffalo.

                   got laid off today --
      Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.

      Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around,
      pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands
      him up center stage.

                   guys what really happened. Tell
                   'em the story behind Fibrerock.
                   The true story.
      The room quiets.    Barney clears his throat.     Fred waits,
      hopeful.
                                 BARNEY
                   Well, there's not much to tell.
                          (trying to remember
                           Fred's phraseology)
                   True, I got a cut... but Fred's
                   got a gut.

                                 FRED

                   mind, but Fred's got the behind.

      Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull.
      Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around"
      desperately, hoping to hear one more snort.
      He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades
      away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one
      more lonely snort...
      ... from Barney, of course.
                                   HERDMASTER
                   Order furs!
      The fezzes come up.

      Fred's a broken man.       Barney moves over, puts his arm
      around him.

      Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench.
      Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.

      smiles at the group.

                Thank you, Brother Chairman.
                Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few
                words. It's no secret that most
                of our lodge members are also
                members of Amalgamated Neolithic
                101... which means that most of us
                aren't gonna be able to make our
                cave payments next month. So my
                agenda for tonight... ends right
                now. There's a time to be a
                Buffalo... there's a time ta be a
                brown nosin' double-crossin'
                creep...
      All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.
                              PILTDOWN
                ... and there's a time to stand up
                and be a man! So let's go down
                there and make the Slate shop into
                slate scrap... then we'll see how
                he gets along without the heavy
                equipment operators of Neolithic
                101! Meeting adjourned!

      With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up.
      Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are
      slapped on. The Buffalo run out.
      When the dust clears, we see that only one member has
      avoided the herding instinct: Barney.
      Now, he turns, runs into --

130   BUFFALO LODGE - RECREATION AREA - NIGHT                    130
      Fred is at the bar, opening a beer. He looks wistfully
      at the old, framed picture on the wall -- reacts as he
      sees --

      Even his childhood shot has been defaced.
132   BACK TO SCENE                                              132

      He sets his jaw with a "screw 'em" expression, downs his
      beer. Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders.

                                 FRED
                   No kidding. They rejected the
                   best candidate --

                                 BARNEY
                   No, no, not that! Piltdown's got
                   the guys all worked up and they're
                   heading down to the quarry!
                   They're gonna wreck the assembly
                   line!

                                 FRED
                          (genuinely worried)
                   Oh, no! That -- that's horrible!
                          (pause)
                   We could end up with half a
                   percent of nothing!
                                 BARNEY
                   No, Fred, if they do that they'll
                   be breakin' the law! Our brother
                   Buffalo could go to jail!
                                 FRED
                   Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come
                   on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em!

      Silent, empty. CAMERA PANS FROM the still yard TO the
      gate. Down the road, we see Piltdown leading the angry
      mob. Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up and over it!
                                 PILTDOWN
                   Okay! Let's start with Slate's
                   golf trophies and work our way
                   up to the assembly line!
      AD LIB angry cheers, and the mob storms into the plant,
      knocking aside equipment and supplies.

134   IN CAR - FRED AND BARNEY - NIGHT                              134
      Both pedaling like mad.

                                 FRED
                   I don't believe this... how did
                   things ever get this out of
                   hand -- ?
                                 BARNEY
                   I know. Makes you wish things
                   were back the way they were...
                   before we was big executives.
                                 FRED
                   Well, I wouldn't go that far...
      Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN.
      Fred looks back and sees --

135   FELDSPAR AND GRAVEL                                            135
      Coming up from rear. Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he
      pulls abreast of Fred.
                                  FELDSPAR
                   Flintstone!   Pull over!

                                 FRED
                   Oh, no, not now...
      Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder.       Fred smiles,
      nods...
136   CLOSE ON FRED'S FEET                                           136
      He slams them down through the floorboard --

137   WIDER                                                          137
      Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a
      record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees
      later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction.
138   FELDSPAR                                                       138

      So astonished he follows this action with his head... a
      bad move because --

                                  GRAVEL

      The patrol CAR runs off the road, CRASHING into a stone
      fire hydrant. Water squirts into the air. Feldspar and
      Gravel are drenched. They're just coming to their senses
      when the ground heaves -- the car's front wheels rise --

                                                               67.

      the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of its
      head up from under the broken curb.

      Led by Piltdown, the workers have grabbed a big timber
      which they're using like a battering ram on the doors of
      the assembly line building. Suddenly, with a crash, the
      doors go down! Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the
      angry workers rush past them.
                                PILTDOWN
                         (loudly)
                  Now we'll show 'em who's boss!
                                PYRITE
                  They can't push us around!
      Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody
      juiced up, and then... when no one is looking...
      ... they slip out the back!
142   REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT                                         142
      Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop --
      we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over, slam right
      through a storage area for crates and barrels which
      collapse all around them.

      Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build-
      ing, knocking a hole in the wall.

      Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of
      them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole
      in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe...

      ... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now
      jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand
      drill.

      Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the
      tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away,
      vanishing just as our heroes stir.

                   Come on Fred.    Time to earn those
                   big bucks.

      They rush into the plant.
144   INT. ASSEMBLY LINE - NIGHT                                  144

      As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and
      Pyrite reappear.
                                 PYRITE
                   Darn that Flintstone and Rubble...
                   they're gonna screw everything
                   up...

                                 PILTDOWN
                   Not if we give 'em a nice long
                   vacation... in the hospital.
      Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some
      rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour-
      aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some
      stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite
      begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while
      Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams
      which he flings below.
145   CLOSE - PYRITE                                              145

      Winds up for another   baseball-type swing -- but as he
      follows through, the   ball-shaped light fixture jerks up
      on its cable. Unable    to stop in time, Pyrite spins
      around, falls on his   ass.
      Barney drops down INTO VIEW, hanging horizontally from
      the rafters. He's holding the light fixture with his
      free hand.

                                 BARNEY
                   Stee-rike one! Heh-hey.    Ready
                   for a curve ball?

      Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand,
      he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters.

                                                             69.

      Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. He pulls down
      on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again.
      Puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another
      see-saw motion...
      ... This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and
      peers under the beam...

      Fred is hanging on the other end.

                                FRED
                  Brother Piltdown... can we talk
                  about this, antler to antler?

      Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.
                                 FRED
                  Guess not...
      Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed
      of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on
      Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase
      after Fred.
148   BARNEY AND PYRITE                                            148
      Square off in the rafters.
                                BARNEY
                  Give me your best shot.
      Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW
      pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens.
      Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...

      ... but this time the window is hinged in the center and
      the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back
      and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.

149   FRED                                                         149
      Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super-
      structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in
      an arc in front of him.

                                FRED
                  Dare you to cross that line.

      Piltdown crosses it.

                                 FRED
                  That line.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Piltdown crosses it. Fred "marks" another one. Piltdown
      doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step.
      Oops. Bad idea: The last "line" was at the edge of a
      straight drop! Piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best
      cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of
      Fred's clothing! Both men fall -- at the last minute
      Piltdown catches a ladder!

150   BELOW - ASSEMBLY LINE                                      150
      Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to
      form the Fibre products! Worse, the impact arouses the
      goatasauruses out of their sleep. Dutifully, they rise,
      and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is
      struggling to his feet! Fred's yell is muffled by the
      clay.

151   OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS                                151
      Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do
      their job. Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough:
      The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.
152   FRED                                                       152
      is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.

      The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting
      to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the
      mat again! A moment later, another "Fred" drops down
      beside him.

155   PILTDOWN                                                   155
      Has descended the ladder, hopping mad. Now, he sees
      Fred coming toward him... Piltdown breaks a big lever off
      the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "FRED"
      SHATTERS.

156   FRED                                                       156

      Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked
      Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to
      "tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the
      clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he
      tries to move... can't!

                                                             71.

      Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug
      towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the next
      one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one...

      Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes
      aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea,
      he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber
      stamp.
      Pyrite comes around the    corner... Barney's head butts him
      in the gut, dodges under    his legs! Then, as Pyrite
      stumbles, Barney stamps    his ass with the word "REJECT."
      Pyrite looks back, sees    this, reddens... raises his club.
                               PYRITE
                 Reject, huh? Whaddya say we
                 reject your head?
      He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and
      grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the
      club, howls --
159   WIDER                                                        159
      The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin
      marked REJECTS -- and drops him.
      Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and
      defective Fibrerock goods.

160   BARNEY                                                       160
      Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts.
      CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet
      another of the duplicate Freds.
      Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above
      the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps
      into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the
      Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --

161   BELOW                                                        161

      Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when
      Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into
      him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor
      towards --

                                                               72.

162   THE END OF THE BUILDING                                        162

      dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel!

                               FELDSPAR
                All right!   You're all under arr --

      Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the
      cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete
      with appropriate sound.

                       (sitting up)
                Whattya know. Even got the spare
                again...

      Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has
      just fallen off!
      Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay
      and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself
      further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of
      the building.

      Wooden bars delineate the holding cells. "Wanted"
      posters of stone are hanging on the walls.
      As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by
      friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now
      clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk.

      They both turn and start down an alley... jamming
      together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney
      comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.

                   me and Fred started with it, I
                   always take a little taste of the
                   Fibre foam. And tonight's batch,

165   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                  165
      Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of
      Slate City. It's even more grandiose than its
      predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge
      office buildings beside it, and then a convention center
      beyond that.

                              LAVA
                ... As you can see, the Fibrerock
                is so light we're using it for
                construction, for furnishings...
                for everything. You can't stack
                a two-bedroom cave this high...

      A small figure appears behind some of the equipment,
      tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards
      the assembly line.
      Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on
      beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre
      hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is

      in security guard uniforms. Lava whistles softly to get
      their attention, can't. Then he sees one of Slate's
      golf trophies. He shrugs, throws it.

      to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite

      Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos
      bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the
      Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the

                                 FRED
                          (nervous)
                   Of course not, Mister Lava.
                   But --

                                 LAVA
                   Call me Jerry. Sit down, please...
      Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE
      CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says --
                                 LAVA
                          (offering one)
                   ... Cigar?
                                 FRED
                   Why, yeah, sure, Jerry.
                                 LAVA
                   Fred, let me get to the bottom
                   slime. Some men -- you and me,
                   for instance -- we're cut out for
                   the big time, the big bucks...
                          (eyeing Fred's
                           girth)
                   ... the big everything.
      Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars.      He puts
      each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk.

173   CLOSER - GIZMO                                                173
      It's actually a frame supporting a little LIZARD. The
      Lizard bites the tip off the cigar, practically chokes
      on it, finally manages to spit it out with difficulty.

                And others?   Wellll...

      Now Lava takes out a lighter, leans across the desk.

      As Lava works the mechanism, two wooden twigs rub rapidly
      across each other and ignite.

                that's what I like about you.
                But you're a big guy with a big
                decision to make. Are you gonna

      Lava throws the door open.        Fred's jaw drops as he

      Three big dino-mounted trucks are parked in front. You
      have to read the words on all three: "ROCKSTYLES OF..."
      "THE RICH..." "AND FAMOUS."

      Technicians roll out gear, set up big spotlights, etc.

      Rockin' Leach is surveying the place with an aide. Fred
      and Wilma are with them. Leach makes a "frame" with his
      hands, "pans" the area.

                   Hmm. Lovely little guest 'ouse,
                   Mister Flintstone. So simple,
                   so ordinary, so unexceptional...
                   why, h'it's almost quaint. Let's
                   say we start with the camera 'ere,

      Leach breaks off, looks over the fence at the Rubble
      homestead. He shakes his head sadly.

                                 FRED
                   W-what's wrong?

                   Well, just look at that yard over
                   there... barbecues and trikes, not
                   exactly the right image...

                          (pointing)
                   Maybe you could move those plants
                   to block them out...?

                                 LEACH
                   Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin'
                   with those greens.
      The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving
      the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over.
                                 WILMA
                   Fred, this was supposed to be a
                   'typical evening' at the
                   Flintstones, and you invited fifty
                   people I don't even know. Now
                   what's going on? Where are they
                   taking my ficus-sauruses?
                                 FRED
                   It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.   It's
                   just not the right image...
      He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and
      trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses
      a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good
      measure.
179   BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                          179

      Betty, hair and face done, but still in a slip, is
      putting a reluctant Bam-Bam into a cute little blazer.
      In the f.g., Barney finishes tying a black tie, then
      struggles into a dinner jacket.

                   Fred's in a high-powered
                   executive job, Betty. There's a
                   lot of pressure on him.
                                 BETTY
                   Yeah... and it's all around his
                   belt. If it wasn't for poor Wilma
                   I wouldn't give him the Geological
                   Time --

                                 BARNEY
                   Trust me, Betty. After the
                   Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same
                   old Fred.
      Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING.
      Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the
      yard and see --

      The television crew has just finished nailing boards up
      over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants
      are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud
      a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off
      until Barney and Betty are in shadow.
      Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza
      dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird
      bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.

      it catches.

      crew members who are busy with scissors and combs and
      brushes.

      Finally, they're done and leave him.

      He has been cut and trimmed like a French poodle. He
      gets a glimpse of himself in the swimming pool and freaks
      out. Then he arches his back, shakes out the hairstyle.

      Barney and Betty appear, Bam-Bam in tow. They come out
      into the yard. Betty waves at Wilma, who comes over,
      whispers.

                Thank heaven. There isn't one

                revolutionize life in the future.
                Frederick, 'ow does it feel to
                know that you 'ave personally
                brought the Stone Age as we know
                it to a long-deserved end?
                              FRED
                       (very affected accent)
                Well, Rockin', you're right, I
                have affected destiny for all
                mankind, and it's a sobering
                thought. However, if I may add a
                personal note at this time, I
                myself cannot personally take
                all the credit for Fibrerock...

                No, I could never have done it
                without the inspiration and
                support of a very special person.
                I'm speaking, of course, of my
                close friend and associate,
                Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O.

192   EXT. SLATE CITY - NIGHT                                      192

      Slate City! In the far future, Manhattan will have New
      Jersey... Philadelphia will have Levittown... L.A. will
      have Burbank... but today Bedrock has... Slate City!
193   CLOSE ON "SLATE NEEDLE" AND FIBRESPHERE                      193
      Both decorated in pennants and bunting, connected to each
      other by a gangway six stories up. Block letters on the
      Fibresphere proclaim "Slate Construction brings you THE
      WONDERFUL WORLD OF FIBRE." A heroic statue of Slate
      himself stands close by the structures. (Sphere and
      needle, of course, are dead on parodies of the Trylon
      and Perisphere, centerpieces of the '39 World's Fair.)
      A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up. Mr. and
      Mrs. Slate and Lava, and Lava's son, POINDEXTER, get out.
      It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn
      hasn't fallen far from the tree.
                              POINDEXTER
                Wow! Is this ever keen! Dad, you
                promise I can cut in all the lines?
                              LAVA
                Of course, Poindexter, of course.
      They head for the mastodon    and pully-powered elevator.
      Standing there are Piltdown    and Pyrite, both in security
      guard uniforms. (Piltdown     is carrying a vaguely-familiar
      satchel). Lava gives them     a big look. They nod. As
      the elevator rises, his two    cronies duck into a stairwell
      marked "NO ADMITTANCE."

      their party clothes. They take some canapes off of a
      table, take a bite... spit them out.

                   We have a serious problem with

                   I mean you're treating them
                   horribly! What's come over you,
                   Fred? Does a little money mean so
                   much to you that you just turn
                   your back on the things that
                   really count?
                                 FRED
                   Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do
                   that. Okay, I admit it: I'm
                   trying to make an impression here,
                   I wanna look good, I wanna be a
                   success...

      He takes her hand, looks into her eyes.       For a moment,
      Wilma's face softens.

      In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging
      out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're
      oblivious to him.

                                 FRED

                   say that volcano futures are
                   ready to explode, ha, ha...

      Suddenly Fred notices that his "audience" has evaporated.
      He looks around, sees everyone headed for their cars,
      the TV crew packing up, etc.
                                 FRED

      elbows.

                                 FRED
                   Hey, what's the hurry? We got a
                   cake shaped like a piece of
                   Fibrerock... I got it, how about
                   some charades? No, even better,
                   twenty questions: 'Am I animal,
                   mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I
                   heard a great one the other day
                   ... a guy walks in a bar with a
                   duckasaurus on his head and the
                   bartender says -- this'll kill
                   you, the bartender says --
      Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of
      glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes
      up to him.

                   Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not

                   until everybody comes back. Go on
                   with the others. The kids got

                   I wouldn't want people to think...
                   to think the Flintstones were
                   party poopers.

      She doesn't know what to say, or what she can say that
      won't shatter his shaky image. She sighs, kisses him,
      then calls out.

                                 WILMA
                   Come on, Pebbles. We're going to

      She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the
      last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty
      catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.

                   Wilma, wait.   I'm going with you.

                   Besides...

                   ... Maybe if we leave the boys
                   alone...?

      Wilma nods, hopeful.
198   EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                                198

      The film crew caravan   is already leaving as Wilma, Betty
      and the kids get into   the Rubble car. The last TV crew-
      man extinguishes the   big spotlight. The house is dark,
      forlorn in the fading   twilight.

                                                            90.

199   REAR OF YARD - NIGHT                                        199
      Fred sits forlorn in the rubble of his party.   Dino comes
      over, nuzzles his leg.

                              FRED
                Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah.
                That's okay. Man and man's best
                friend.

      He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes
      a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all
      the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's
      car and drive away.
200   FRED                                                        200

      sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "FVF"
      patch. He suddenly rips it off in a fury. Then he looks
      at --
201   THE WALL IN FRONT OF BARNEY'S PROPERTY                      201
202   BACK TO SCENE                                               202
      Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening. Then he
      grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in
      a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters;
      the potted plants go flying.
203   FRED                                                        203
      His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with
      dirt... then he sees --
204   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE                     204
      -- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure
      sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --

      Here, mechanical figures in an all-Fibre home move
      klutzily around the room.

      bubbling gunk... and those iridescent vegetable pearls

212   INT. BARNEY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT                               212
      Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and
      memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and
      are singing.
                              FRED & BARNEY
                'Now it's time to do or die, grab

                fight, fight, fight for Bedrock
                High!'

      They break up laughing. Fred chuckles, looks at one of
      the many old photographs strewn around.
                              FRED
                Boy, those were the days, Barney.
                Bedrock High winning all those
                games... and you and me right in
                the middle of it.

213   NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PHOTO                                  213
      The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and
      Barney in their cheerleading costumes. Barney has a
      sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like
      "mascot" costume. He's holding the hideously-sculpted
      head under his arm.

                              BARNEY
               Yeah.   Too bad we never made the
               team.
                             FRED
               So what? We made the team spirit.
               That's just as important...
               whatever happened to those
               cheerleader costumes?

                             BARNEY
               You know Betty. She never throws
               anything away.
      He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it.    There they
      are.
                               FRED
                        (rummaging in it)
               Boy.    Talk about memories.
      Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins,
      pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old
      "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally,
      he can zip it up, stern to stem.
                             FRED
               Back then, we thought a pop quiz
               was a big problem. We didn't
               know how good we had it. No
               problems, no worries...

      Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like
      head. He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail
      behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and
      forward.
                             BARNEY
               Speaking of problems and worries,
               shouldn't we get on over to
               Slate's party?
      Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into
      place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in
      sync.

                   What for? So him and all his
                   fancy friends can look down their
                   noses at us?

      Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred
      steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his
      direction.
                                 FRED
                          (echo-y)
                   All they've been doing is using us,
                   Barney. And meanwhile --

      Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for
      a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge
      where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.
                                 FRED
                          (normal voice)
                   -- Meanwhile all the time they
                   were laughing at us.

                                  BARNEY
                   Yeah?   When did you notice that?
                                 FRED
                   About an hour ago.
                                 BARNEY
                   Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred.
      Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING,
      a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall
      apart.

      Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush
      over to the model. It's the interim version we saw
      earlier.

      The decomposition continues, walls and supports turning
      into sand and running down before our eyes. In a Rube

      Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days
      are rock solid.
216   BACK TO SCENE                                                216

                                 BARNEY
                   It should be. There's enough
                   coo-coo berry resin in there to
                   petrify a brontosaurus --
      Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models
      to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing
      awareness.

                   What's it?

                   Remember I said the Fibrefoam
                   tasted funny? It was the coo-coo
                   sap that was missing!

                                 BARNEY
                   Why? Because coo-coo berries are
                   as valuable as goldrock! And
                   we've had tons of 'em delivered
                   to the plant since we started...

      by model story. Finally the "DISK" on top of the needle
      is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner
      plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.

                          (worried)
                   -- B-barney... what do we do?

      Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered
      flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.
                                 BARNEY
                   Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's
                   our only chance -- their only
                   chance!
      Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they
      rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of
      the model "Slate City"...

      WIDEN FROM a young kid who is drinking a glass of water
      and simultaneously singing with a ventriloquist's dummy.
      Obviously, the talent show has begun.
      In the audience, Lava fidgets with nervous and confident
      energy... gives Wilma a big look.

                                 LAVA
                   You're certainly looking lovely
                   this evening, Mrs. Flintstone.
                   Life with a junior executive must
                   agree with you.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 WILMA
                   Uh... thank you... I think.

                                 LAVA
                          (looking into her
                           eyes)
                   Yes. I think so, too.
                          (smiling)
                   Imagine how good you'd look
                   with a senior executive.

                                  WILMA
                   Oh?   Is Fred getting promoted?
      Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The
      ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid
      bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the
      stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al
      steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the
      expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing
      endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the
      distant volcanic ridge.
                                 HEADMISTRESS
                          (as applause dies)
                   Sank you, ladies and gentlemen.

      She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands,
      waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother.

      She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter.
      He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins
      to play:

      Their smiles become fixed. (Up on the spotlights, the
      little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their
      ears.)
      In the wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam, DINO MOANS, hides
      his head under his paws.

      On the refreshment table, GLASSES CRACK... a cake falls.
219   CLOSE ON LAVA                                                219

220   INT. EMPTY FIBRERIDE - TIGHT ON ANOTHER WATCH - NIGHT        220

      This one a pocket job. (Like Lava's, it's really a
      little sundial with a built-in burning match above it to
      provide a shadow!) We WIDEN, and see that this watch
      is held in a green, scaley claw.
221   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                221

      It's the xenosaurus, lurking behind the   exhibits! Now,
      the CREATURE GRUNTS confidently, lights   up a cigar.
      Then it picks up a canvas bag and a big   toolbox and
      tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the   Fibre ride.

      Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.
                              FRED
                What'll we do when we get there?

                              BARNEY
                We just tell Mister Slate that all
                500 acres of his development are
                going to crumble into dust any
                minute.
                       (holds up the
                        flit gun)
                Then we zap the stairs and
                corridors with some of this
                coo-coo sap. I just hope we have
                enough to get everybody out --
                whoops!

      He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun,
      the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume,
      and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                           over the road)
                   -- I can't see straight --

      Barney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one
      hand and the monster head with the other.
                                 BARNEY
                   Hang on, hang on --

      Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred
      flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand,
      tries to help Fred with the other.

223   EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                               223
      It careens around even more wildly now.      There's several
      near collisions.
                                                    CUT TO:
224   EXT. "ROCKDONALD'S" RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         224
      "Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches
      of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig-
      atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and
      Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from
      little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's
      Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind
      them proudly reads "OVER 100 SOLD.")
                                 FELDSPAR
                          (mouth full, bitching)
                   Speed traps again! Face it,
                   Gravel. I'm in a rut... and
                   meanwhile, the guys who went
                   through the academy with me,
                   they're all big shots now:
                   Sam Slate... Dirty Harock...
                   Magma, P.I. And you know why?
                   'Cause they got the breaks,
                   that's why!

      Suddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING
      TIRES and HONKING HORNS. They look out their window
      at --
225   FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST                                 225

      both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume
      head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face
      inside the jaws of the monster mask.)

                                                            101.

                S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some
                sorta creature was attacking that
                little guy -- !
                              FELDSPAR
                There's a lesson there, Gravel...
                never pick up hitchhikers.
                Besides --
                       (realizing)
                -- Did you say 'creature'?

      They do a big double-take at the now-vanishing car.
                              FELDSPAR & GRAVEL
                The xenosaurus!

      Excited, Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a DISPATCH
      PARAKEET in a police uniform pops INTO VIEW. Feldspar
      grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone.
                              FELDSPAR
                This is a xenosaurus alert.
                Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The
                creature has been sighted on the
                Slate City exit of the Venturock
                Freeway! It is driving a brown
                late model sedan and eating a
                white male Caucasian. Car twelve
                is in hot pursuit.
      He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away,
      but gives him a look.

                              FELDSPAR
                       (remembering)
                Oh, yeay... over and out!

      The bird nods, appeased, flies off.
                              DISPATCH PARAKEET
                       (as it goes)
                Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way.
                Car Twelve is on the way...

                              FELDSPAR
                       (thrilled)
                Gravel, this could mean promotions
                for both of us!
                       (trotting up to
                        speed)
                Load the shotgun and turn on the
                siren!

227   FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING                                    227
      Barney is rocking Fred's head back and forth, finally
      gives it one last mighty yank. Something breaks.
      Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car.
      Fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head.
      It rattles. When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth
      no longer opens and closes in sync.

                              FRED

                Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore!
      Suddenly both men (pardon, man and xenosaurus) react to
      an approaching SIREN. They both look back at --

228   FELSPAR'S PATROL CAR                                      228
      Closing in. Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth
      CAT and is "cranking" its tail. As it WAILS away, the
      cops close in on our heroes.

                doing in that costume? Start
                talking about coo-coo berries and
                Fibrerock? By then it'll be too
                late!

                'Hen yore height, yore height...
      Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn.
      CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI.

230   SLATE CITY - REAR GATE                                    230
      A fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the
      distance, we can see the dark Slate Scrapers, and past
      them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and
      Slate Needle.
      We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup
      Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the
      ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a
      sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE." The fence
      collapses all around the car.

      Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney,
      covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with
      relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is
      still intact.

                  We'd better split up; that way at

      CAMERA ADJUSTS to take in Poindexter's big finish as he
      slides forward on his knees.
      There's a scattering of half-hearted applause, led by
      Lava and the Slates.

      poised in the stances we recognize as the "first
      positions" of the "Dino Dance." However, whereas the
      previous version of this was done impromptu and
      a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw
      hats alone, this time the kids and Dino are fully
      costumed, with sequins, batons and the like, and the
      dance is completely choreographed.

      who glances over at the judges long enough to see that
      they like this a lot better than the accordion act.
      Suddenly Mrs. Slate jumps up, barges on stage. The
      MUSIC DIES.
                                 HEADMISTRESS
                   Madame Slate, what ees wrong -- ?

                                 MRS. SLATE
                   I'll tell you what's wrong! This
                   'act' is an absolute disgrace!
                   This is supposed to be a talent
                   show!  And a pedestrian animal act
                   like this belongs in a circus!

236   WILMA AND BETTY                                           236

      React, furious, jump out of their seats.
                                 BETTY
                   A circus, huh? Well, if our kids
                   belong in a circus with their act,
                   then your little nephew belongs in
                   a zoo with his --
                                 WILMA
                   Yeah -- a zoo where the animals
                   are dead -- because if they aren't,
                   they will be!
                                 MRS. SLATE
                   Why, how dare you! Mrs.
                   Flintstein, I'll have you know
                   that my little Poindexter has been
                   trained by the finest tutors!
                   Poindexter! Show them! Encore!

      The kid jumps up, begins to play. Immediately another
      GLASS SHATTERS. But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK,
      and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one
      by one.

                                 MRS. SLATE
                          (alarmed)
                   Ah... Poindexter... that's enough
                   ... Poindexter...?

      The kids stops... But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES.
      Then one of the tables collapses.

      Pause. Every head in the room swivels around and stares
      at Poindexter. Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside.
      But the destruction continues: Another WINDOW PANEL
      SHATTERS. Then, the entire building shakes.

                                                             105.

      Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava for support, ends up
      pulling him down, too. Slate gets to his knees and looks
      out the window... and his jaw drops in astonishment.
238   HIS POV - SLATE CITY                                       238

      In the distance, with a CRACKLING ROAR, the little rows
      of Fibrerock tract houses are falling like dominoes in
      a wave that is rolling toward the Slate Needle.
239   SLATE CITY DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT                             239

      A flashlight beam  rakes the CAMERA. Feldspar, shotgun
      in one hand, light  in the other, looks around cautiously.
      (The shotgun has a  slingshot mechanism; the flashlight
      is a mirror-backed  candle.)

      Behind him, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.   Feldspar tenses, but
      it's --
                              GRAVEL
                No sign of the driver...

                You kidding? By now he's a couple
                of shinbones and a belch.
      Gravel drops down on one knee, excited.   He shines his
      light on Fred's big "clawprints."
                              GRAVEL
                Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep
                these tracks are! That xeno thing
                must weigh a ton!
      They aim their lights at the tracks, begin to follow
      them. Suddenly they round a corner and come face to
      face with --

      He's stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with
      the monster head again. Now, he freezes in twin flash-
      light beams!

                              FELDSPAR
                Okay, lizard, reach for the sky!
      Fred hesitates... then, hearing a CREAK and GROAN, he
      looks at the HOUSE beside him. The stucco-like exterior
      of Fibrerock is beginning to crumble.

      house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself,
      obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause.
      Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact
      has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its
      hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks
      at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now.

      Quickly, he runs toward it.

      City. He falls on top of his accordion, smashing it with
      one last dissonant squeeze.

      Barney runs INTO the SHOT, sees the steps about to go,
      dives for them... too late! He ends up with a face full

      Barney aims, pulls back the plunger... too late! The
      elevator is gone. The cable swings back and forth
      loosely, "whapping" the shaft walls as it shoots upwards.
      Fred dives for the cable, misses! As he stumbles, Barney
      leaps on Fred's back, catches the cable! As Barney
      starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles!

                   Gee, Pilty, I thought the real
                   ones were gonna be moved up here
                   for us ta steal -- whatta waste
                   a time --

                          (snapping fingers)
                   Now I remember! These guys were
                   pulling this xenosaurus act that
                   night at the plant! What's this,
                   Lava... 'Plan B'?
                                 LAVA
                   Uncle! Are you going to stand
                   there while aspersions are being
                   cast at the Slate family? This
                   is absurd --

                                 SLATE
                   Of course it is! Why, without
                   the coo-coo berry sap, Fibrerock
                   would be completely --
                          (realizing)
                   -- unstable...

      Suddenly the entire building shudders.      Dust falls from
      the ceiling. Everyone looks at Lava.

                   All right, all right, I admit it!
                   I got in over my head in the stock
                   market... took some big losses...
                   I had these guys pull jobs for me
                   all over town disguised as a
                   monster... but it still wasn't
                   enough... and when I saw all those
                   coo-coo berries being delivered
                   every day, I guess I just lost my
                   head... I figured with the Woca
                   sap in the Fibremix, the berry
                   juice as superfluous...
                                 SLATE
                   I'll tell you what's superfluous,
                   Lava... your liver! So why don't
                   we remove it -- !
      He leaps, snarling, on top of Lava... Fred and Barney
      pull them apart. Then, more falling dust and beams give
      everyone more pressing problems --
                                                    CUT TO:
255   EXT. SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT                                  255
      Rescue VEHICLES and police CARS ROAR up, slam to a halt,
      CAT SIRENS WAILING. The rescue workers jump out.
      Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched
      to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks
      and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to
      raise the ladders.
256   CLOSE ON A HOOK AND LADDER TRUCK                           256

      It's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus,
      which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred-
      ibly long neck. The bony plates on the creature's back
      make perfect stairs.

      However, the creature is noticeably listless and
      uncooperative.

                                 FIRE CHIEF
                   Come on, come on, what's the hold
                   up -- ?
                                 FIREFIGHTER
                   It's the kibble crisis, sir --
                   the firesauruses have been on
                   half-rations for a month!
      Above them, the BUILDING SHUDDERS again.

                                                             112.

257   IN THE SLATE NEEDLE                                        257
      Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they
      hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire
      spreads.
                               WILMA
                        (pointing)
                Fred!   There's a fire hose -- !

      Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE
      HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney
      take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and
      cuts them off.
      Helpless, they step back.

      With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible
      through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then
      the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to
      decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture
      in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well,
      life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose,
      CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here
      ... rolls up to Slate's feet.

      Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it:
      Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces
      Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even
      Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under
      pressure... and speaking of --
258   GRACE                                                         258
      -- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread
      costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little
      animal print undies.
259   BETTY                                                         259

      In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns
      Bam-Bam's face away from this display.

                              BAM-BAM
                D-dad, are we gonna be okay?
                              BARNEY
                       (pause; false smile)
                Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for
                the fire department. Right, Fred?
                              FRED
                Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be
                just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              113.

      He's started yelping because he's realized his arm    is
      on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin    beating
      at the arm with anything in their hands, and then    Fred
      suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with    a small
      flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas    stage
      magician.

                                 FRED
                   -- Wait a minute -- I don't feel
                   anything at all --

      With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames,
      and then confidentially snuffs it out.
                                 BARNEY
                   It must be the suit, Fred -- old
                   Bedrock High built them things to
                   last --
      Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the
      guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same
      idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth.
      All brighten.

      Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
                                  BARNEY
                          (rapping on the head)
                   -- Okay?
                                 FRED
                   Hist hust fine!
      He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks
      at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the
      amber GLASS --

260   IN THE BOX                                                     260
      A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside,     SNORING. (Note
      to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is      not quite a
      snake: it has little vestigial forepaws      the better to
      emote with. Right now the snoring head      is in those
      little paws.)

      The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the
      smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say
      "one moment." Then the pythonsaurus turns his head
      towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps
      loudly.

      We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away...

                                                               114.

261   IN THE MAIN ROOM                                            261
      Everyone retreats from the fire. Slate picks up the head
      of the statue, his only souvenir.

262   WITH FRED                                                       262
      Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally
      finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a
      napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns
      and runs back into the other room. (Behind him, yards
      and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart-
      ment behind the box.) Water shoots out of the creature's
      mouth.
263   WIDER                                                           263

      Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of
      flame in the room. All the guests cheer, rush forward
      and slap Fred on the back. Pebbles jumps up on him and
      kisses him.
                                FRED
                  Hit fuzz nudding... wheely...
      The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.
                                PYTHONSAURUS
                  Hey, what am I, chopped liver?
                                BARNEY
                  Come on, everybody -- we'll go
                  out the way we came!
      Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying
      a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and
      Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent
      Fibresphere.

                  first, yeah, yeah, provided that
                  uh, there's room for the women...

      Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his
      costume) a big look up and down, looks TOWARD the CAMERA.
                                  PYTHONSAURUS
                  Hey, not bad.    Wonder if she lives
                  around here.

      Just then Fred tilts back the monster head.        The
      pythonsaurus reacts.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                   PYTHONSAURUS
                   Heartbreaker!

      Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and
      Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate
      Needle completely collapses.

264   EXT. FIBRESPHERE - LONG SHOT                               264
      The Slate Needle tumbles down, taking a big chunk of the
      Fibresphere with it! But the rest of the huge globe
      stays put... for now.

      Barney gives the dwindling circle of solid Fibre around
      the group another shot of coo-coo juice. Poindexter Lava
      pushes his way forward.

      Embarrassed, Mrs. Slate grabs the kid by the neck,
      practically throws him at the cable. She follows him
      down, followed by Lava and Mr. Slate.
269   REAR OF FLEEING PEOPLE                                       269

      Fred and Barney have bravely held up the rear, their

                                 WILMA
                   Oh, Fred -- that's the most
                   beautiful thing I've ever heard!
      They kiss... she drops to safety...!

271   BELOW                                                      271

      Wilma slides into a rescue net, gets on unsteady feet
      next to Betty.

272   BACK UPSTAIRS                                             272
                                 FRED
                   Lhet's dogh it!

      Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a
      heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake...
      both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole
      pulley mechanism falls right down between them and
      through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining
      structure collapses!
273   BELOW                                                      273
      Everyone reacts in horror --

      Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's
      not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All
      that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two
      tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of
      rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all
      that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the
      ground!

275   CLOSER                                                     275
      Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney.
      Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney
      aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the
      kids. It's all they can do.
276   BELOW                                                      276

      Wilma and Betty gasp... what can be done?
277   THE SECOND ISLAND                                         277

      Bricks and chunks of Fibre stir... a form sits up...
      it's -- Dino! He looks around at the situation, becomes
      agitated... he wants to help... but how?

                                                            118.

278   WILMA AND BETTY                                            278
      Suddenly become inspired.

                                BETTY
                  W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo...
                  those wires... do you think -- ?

                               WILMA
                  Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try
                  it -- ! Dino! Dino, look down
                  here -- !

279   DINO                                                         279
      Obeys, puzzled --

      Amazingly, they grab scraps of wood, borrow fire
      fighter's helmets, and begin to do a buck and wing.
                         WILMA   AND   BETTY

281   BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO                                     281
      MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes
      fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly
      bridge that leads to his master and friends.
282   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              282

      Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his
      steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island!
      Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids
      on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he
      "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to
      Barney -- and then --

283   LONG SHOT                                                    283
      -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to
      safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as
      Wilma and Betty wind up!

                                WILMA AND BETTY
                  Yes, I don't need to shimmy,
                  I don't need to bop
                  'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin'
                  THE IGNEOUS ROCK!

                                                            119.

284   FRED                                                         284
      rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's
      slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up...
      suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up
      and sees --
285   HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS                       285

      All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the
      police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic
      mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys.

      Feldspar is at the head of the group. He cocks his
      shotgun. The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch
      menacingly --

                                FELDSPAR
                  It's the xenosaurus -- stand back,
                  men -- it's a vicious killer --
                  Ready -- Aim --
                                FRED
                         (with desperate poignancy)
                  High ham noght a zenosore! High
                  ham hay hooman beeng -- !
      BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin
      slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen
      chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets
      and shells bounce off its resilient surface.
286   CLOSE - FRED                                                 286
      Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that
      stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it
      with his claws --
      -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him
      decomposes! He's back in the line of fire!
287   DINO                                                         287

      Flanked by Wilma, Barney and the kids, who are shouting
      for the police to stop, only Dino the wonder bronto has
      the wits to act!

      "YI-YI-YI-ING," he races forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING --
      and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's
      monster suit and -- de-pants him!
      Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now
      revealed striped undershorts.

288   WIDER                                                        288

      Then Officer Gravel takes a good look at that rear end.

                                 GRAVEL
                   Hey, those are the biggest shorts
                   I've ever seen...
                          (realizing)
                   ... It... it must be Mister
                   Flintstone! Cease fire!
                          (to Feldspar)
                   Gee, Sarge, now you don't have
                   to shoot him -- !

      Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head
      finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns.
      (Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise
      his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles
      it away from his superior.)
289   THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN                           289
      Safe, they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers
      Dino's affection. (In the b.g., a police car holding
      Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava
      is chasing the car.)

      Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug.
                                 SLATE
                   Flintstone. Rubble. I... I
                   don't know what to say. I... I
                   treated you horribly... I ignored
                   you, abused you... and then you
                   come here and risk your necks like
                   this... well, there's no price you
                   can put on something like that,
                   so I won't even try. But let me
                   give you...
                          (with great
                           poignancy)
                   ... a hearty handshake.

                                 MRS. SLATE
                   Dear, don't you think a little
                   more than that is in order?

                   I am not being hysterical, I am
                   being fair -- now the Flintsteins
                   and Rabbles saved all of our
                   lives, not to mention your
                   reputation.

                   Okay, okay.
                          (to Fred and Barney)
                   Boys, I'm feeling guilty about
                   how you've been taken advantage
                   of, so I'll tell you what... I'm
                   going to give you back all
                   world-wide rights to Fibrerock,
                   free and clear.
      He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it.

      Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby
      pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another
      shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and
      digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out
      their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of
      Fibrerock crumbs.

293   FRED, BARNEY, SLATE AND OTHERS                                293

      Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the
      pile, munching like crazy.

      Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower
      down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some
      pieces, he nibbles on it a little.

                                   FRED

                   Dino kibble...?
      Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching
      animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with
      the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth...
      chews. His eyes widen...

295   EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT                           295

      We're back where we began. As "The End" appears on the
      drive-in screen, cars are streaming out of the drive-in
      theatre. The Flintstone car is among them.
296   EXT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                              296

      Fred and company roll into a '50's-style drive-in
      restaurant. A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS.

      A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over.
      Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods, scampers
      O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici-
      pation... and then the girl returns with a massive rack
      of ribs on a car tray. She hooks it on the edge of
      the driver's door... and the entire car tips over with a
      crash.

                                                CUT TO:
297   EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                              297

      WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino
      runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already
      asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth
      cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a
      milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down
      beside it. He shuts the door.
      Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window.
      Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then
      slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the
      door... it's locked!

                                    2ND REVISED DRAFT

                                     February 8, 1993

                

               TITLES UNFOLD IN BLACKNESS as we are lulled by the distant 
               flute-like sounds of a recorder. Overall the effect is 
               mournful and haunting, elegant and serene...

               ...and we CRASH TO:

               EXT - BARENTS SEA - NIGHT

               ...a storm of inconceivable force and violence. Merciless 
               arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirty-foot swells.

               This is the last place in God's creation that any human being 
               should be. And yet...

               ...the prow of a three-masted ship rises massively before 
               us, looming from the darkness and chaos. it crashes upward 
               through a swell and slams back down again, plunging nose- 
               first into the trough. The sails on the forward mast are 
               still deployed. It's insane; in this weather they should be 
               stowed (as is already the case with masts 2 and 3).

               Hurtling toward us. Rising and falling. Thundering through 
               the swells. And as she sweeps past CAMERA within a seeming 
               hairbreadth, we PAN with the ship and find ourselves...

               EXT - SHIP - NIGHT

               ...aboard the "Alexander Nevsky," along for the ride whether 
               we like it or not. There are men all around us, dark screaming 
               FIGURES glimpsed and half-glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes 
               flapping in the gale. A GROUP OF MEN are in a life-or-death 
               tug of war

                                     WALTON
                         PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL!

               Riiiiippp! All eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears 
               loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing 
               tatters. The jib-arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, 
               trailing rope and fabric. The men dive aside as the jib 
               smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb. Splintered 
               shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel.

               Walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face- 
               down on the pitching deck.

               GRIGORI, the first mate, scrambles to Walton's aid. Walton 
               shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees. LIGHTNING 
               throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: 
               blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, 
               staining his teeth. He gazes up at the mainsail, still intact 
               and straining against the wind. We hear a huge CRACK!

               The base of the mast is starting to give.

                                     WALTON
                         Cut the damn rigging free before we 
                         lose the mast!

               Long-handled axes are grabbed from their mounts. Frantic men 
               begin hacking at the ropes. Walton snatches an axe from a 
               passing crewman and elbows his way to the front. He attacks 
               a guy-rope with primal fury, CAMERA rising and falling with 
               the motion of his axe. Suddenly, a chilling cry from high 
               above:

                                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
                         IIIICEBEEEEERG!

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The LOOKOUT is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope 
               knotted at the chest. He points ahead.

               WALTON and the others spin to look as A PANORAMIC SHOT OF 
               THE BARENTS SEA reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. 
               The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting 
               the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying 
               these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine 
               field.

               An iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the 
               foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us 
               into darkness...

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               ...and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas 
               billows away to reveal 'Walton and the crew, gazing in 
               breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before 
               them like a ghostly white mountain. Walton finds his voice:

                                     WALTON
                         HARD TO PORT!

               THE PILOT fights to turn the wheel. Men rush to his aid, 
               throw their backs into it, straining to the limit. The wheel 
               is grudging, fighting them every inch of the way.

               PUSH IN on Walton and the crew:

                                     GRIGORI
                         It's going to ram us.

                                     WALTON
                         It wouldn't dare.

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The lookout fumbles under his coat, grabs the rosary around 
               his neck, clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands. Face 
               white with terror. Breath coming in ragged gasps.

               SHIP'S POV

               Crashing through the swells. Rising and falling. Tilting the 
               world and the audience on its ear. iceberg looming.  For a 
               brief moment we seem to be veering past. But then we swing 
               back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge...

               ...and smack the ice.

               VARIOUS QUICK-CUT ANGLES

               God just hit the ship with an anvil. Mast #1 snaps at the 
               base with a thunderous CRACK and begins to topple in a 
               symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging...

               The lookout on mast #2 is vaulted through the railing of the 
               crow's nest, screaming through the air, arms and legs 
               windmilling as he plummets head-first toward the deck below... 

               And is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around 
               his chest, We hear another horrible CRACK... the sound of 
               his back breaking...

               Men are sliding, tumbling, screaming. Mast #1 completes its 
               fall, slamming massively to the deck, shattering a section 
               of the gunwale to splinters. Utter panic. Total chaos...

               Sheer mortal terror. And as the sequence builds to a final 
               brain-splitting crescendo of sound and fury, we

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               Total, stunning silence.

               A glittering wasteland of ice. Breathlessly cold. Even the 
               sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon. Pellets of 
               snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a 
               desolate arctic wind. It's as if Hell had erupted through 
               the floor of the Earth in the form of ice. Nothing could 
               survive here. Nothing. 

               SLOW PAN reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at 
               a permanent list. Silent. We see no signs of life.

               SUPE TITLE: "The Arctic, 1839."

               VARIOUS LINGERING ANGLES provide ominous detail-shots of the 
               Nevsky

               A flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind...

               The pilot's wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice. The 
               forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb, 
               extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging...

               The ship's prow is smashed open above the water line...

               A familiar rosary lies broken on the deck. Beads scattered. 
               |A tiny Christ figure lies with arms thrown wide, painted 
               eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice...

               HIGH, HIGH ANGLE

               From the top of mast #2. A breathtaking perspective of the 
               entire ship below, guaranteed to induce vertigo. The corpse 
               of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen 
               rope, His posture mimics the Christ figure: His arms thrown 
               wide, dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet 
               of ice. A ghastly still-life, the corpse twisting ever-so-
               slightly on the wind, rope creaking...

               A SAILOR thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the 
               rigging, WIDEN to reveal TWO MORE MEN as they reach out with 
               long gaffing poles to snag the corpse.

               EXT - NEVSKY - LOW ANGLE FROM ICE - TWILIGHT

               Walton watches them reel the body in. ANGLE SHIFTS as he 
               turns, revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to 
               free the ship. Axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming 
               into the ice, throwing up frozen chips. The men are near 
               collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces. The dogs are 
               nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow. Walton 
               rejoins the men, rams his axe fiercely into the ice.

                                     WALTON
                         Put your backs into it!

                                     SAILOR #1
                         What's the use? This godless ice 
                         stretches for miles! Would you have 
                         us chow our way back to England?

                                     WALTON
                         No. But we'll chop our way to the 
                         North Pole if we have to. Inch by 
                         bloody inch.

                                     GRIGORI
                         You can't mean to go on! Our journey 
                         is ended! The best we can hope for 
                         now is to get out of this alive!

                                     SAILOR #2
                         Aye, if the ice ever lets us!

                                     WALTON
                         The ice will break. And when it does, 
                         we proceed north... as planned.

               Cries of dismay from the men. Grigori thrusts his arm toward 
               the sky, pointing at the corpse on the mast.

                                     GRIGORI
                         At the cost of how many more lives?

               He's interrupted by a long, chilling HOWL. The lead husky 
               rises to its feet, hackles up, HOWLING at some unseen thing 
               in the distance. The other dogs start rising around him, 
               joining in, staring off across the ice.

                                     GRIGORI
                         There's something out there.

               The dogs are going berserk. The lead husky breaks free and 
               launches himself across the ice. The men scramble to restrain 
               the animals, but three more break away and take off after 
               their leader. Walton snatches up his rifle.

                                     WALTON
                         You five come with me! The rest stay 
                         with the ship!

               EXT - ARCTIC PANORAMA - TWILIGHT

               The Nevsky in the distance. The dogs come howling across the 
               ice toward us. The men trail substantially behind.

               BOOM DOWN to the icy boulders f.g. A massive hand comes 
               briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin 
               rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal 
               surgical scars marring the wrist. A HUGE DARK FIGURE wipes 
               frame, fleeing into the rocks. The dogs come bounding past 
               in pursuit, snarling and slavering.

               THE RUNNING MEN hear an INHUMAN HOWL rise amidst those of 
               the dogs. A vicious free-for-all echoes from the rocks.

               Barking gives way to shrill squeals. An object is launched 
               from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc.

               Some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground 
               with tremendous impact before them...

               ...and they find themselves staring in horror At the sight 
               of the lead dog. Silence now. Those who have fallen, rise.

               Walton cocks his rifle. The group proceeds, picks and axes 
               held ready, slowly skirting the rocks...

               ...and the massacre is revealed. Blood-stained ice. Dead, 
               mangled animals strewn about. One twitching survivor crawls 
               toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its 
               entrails in a red smear.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Look.

               They follow his gaze. Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, 
               ascending the rocks. Most are smeared and vague... but one 
               is clearly a bare human footprint. Several men cross 
               themselves. Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the 
               surviving dog. BLAM! A single bullet to the brain ends its 
               misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice. The shot echoes 
               for miles.

                                     WALTON
                         Back to the ship.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

               Silhouetted against the aurora borealis. The horizon swirls 
               mysteriously with color and light. Distant slivers of 
               lightning kiss the earth. Men keep watch in furtive groups, 
               huddled against the cold, breath punching the air with billows 
               of vapor. A massive CRACKLING is heard. A YOUNG SAILOR spins, 
               jumpy.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         Only the ice to starboard, boy.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         Is it breaking up?

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         Just dancing on the current. It'll 
                         freeze even tighter come next wind.

               CAMERA DRIFTS past to another group:

                                     SAILOR #4
                         It was a polar bear. That's what I 
                         say.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         Say all you want, but you weren't 
                         there. It left human tracks.

                                     SAILOR #6
                         No man could tear those dogs apart.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         No human. We've roused a demon from 
                         the ice.

               CLANG-CLANG! The men spin. A SAILOR on starboard has rung 
               the signal bell. The men race over, crowding the gunwale.

                                     SAILOR
                         Something. In the mist.

               Walton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, 
               rifle aimed at the sky. The men wait. Holding their breath. 
               Scanning the darkness.

               AN APPARITION looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe 
               of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis. 
               The figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor 
               kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side 
               and lolling slowly with the motion of the current.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         It's the demon! Shoot while you've a 
                         chance!

               The Pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box 
               spotlight and swings it around. The beam seeks out the specter 
               and pins it in a dim circle of light... revealing a man 
               collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions 
               with frozen leather straps, Dead dogs lie in icy heaps around 
               him.

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               The men venture onto the shifting ice with lanterns raised.

               Grappling lines are unslung and thrown, the ice floe snagged. 
               Gaffs reach out, drawing it closer. Men clasp arms, forming 
               a human chain. Grigori is the first to reach the motionless 
               figure on the dog sled.

                                     WALTON
                         Dead?

               Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the 
               furred hood to search the neck for a pulse...

               ...and the figure scares the shit out of him. With a 
               convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood 
               rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, 
               beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware. 
               Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with 
               VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - NIGHT

               A HOWLING WIND has kicked up, pelting the huddled sentries 
               with sleet. CAMERA TRACKS past, moving steadily toward the 
               dimly-glowing window of Walton's cabin...

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT

               ...where we find Walton and Grigori in tense discussion:

                                     GRIGORI
                         Captain, I implore you. The men are 
                         frightened and angry. They want your 
                         assurance.

                                     WALTON
                         They knew the risks when they signed 
                         on. I've come too far to turn back 
                         now.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Then you run the danger of pushing 
                         them to mutiny.

               Walton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on 
               the table before him.

                                     WALTON
                              (low, tight)
                         Let them try.

               Grigori is taken aback. He hears a shifting of blankets and 
               glances to the captain's bed. Walton follows his look.

               Frankenstein has awakened and is watching them.

               Grigori exits, uneasy under Frankenstein's gaze. Walton rises, 
               retrieves a pot from the stove.

                                     WALTON
                         You're awake. I've prepared some 
                         broth. It'll help restore you.

                                     VICTOR
                              (hoarse, faltering)
                         I'm... dying.

               Victor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before 
               his face. Fingers skeletal and black.

                                     VICTOR
                         Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple 
                         diagnosis.

                                     WALTON
                         Are you a physician?

                                     VICTOR
                              (faint smile)
                         How is it you come to be here?

                                     WALTON
                         There's a startling question, coming 
                         from you.
                              (beat)
                         I'm captain of this ship. We sailed 
                         from Archangel a month ago, seeking 
                         a passage to the North Pole.

                                     VICTOR
                         Ah. An explorer.

                                     WALTON
                         Would-be. I'm plagued with my share 
                         of difficulties just at the moment.

                                     VICTOR
                         I heard.

                                     WALTON
                         I can't say I blame them. We're 
                         trapped in this ice and bedeviled by 
                         some sort of... creature.

                                     VICTOR
                         Creature? A... human like creature?

                                     WALTON
                              (stunned)
                         You know of it?

                                     VICTOR
                         Your men are right to be afraid.

                                     WALTON
                         Then explain it, whatever it is. It 
                         could save the voyage. I've spent 
                         years planning this. My entire 
                         fortune.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'd persist at the cost of your 
                         own life? The lives of your crew?

                                     WALTON
                         Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge 
                         we gain, the achievements we leave 
                         behind... those live on.

               Victor reaches out with his blackened claw of a hand, pulls 
               him closer. Impassioned, intense:

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you share my madness?

                                     WALTON
                         Madness?

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY on Victor's face...

                                     VICTOR
                         We are kindred, you and I. Men of 
                         ambition. Let me tell you all that I 
                         have lost in such pursuits. I pray 
                         my story will come to mean for you 
                         all that is capricious and evil in 
                         man.

                                     WALTON
                              (angry, frightened)
                         Who are you?

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat)
                         My name is Frankenstein...

               And CAMERA proceeds into the bottomless depths of Victor's 
               staring eye, plunging us into:

               TOTAL DARKNESS. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. A METRONOME fades up 
               before us.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Failure has no pride, Victor. You 
                         must try again.

                                     LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
                         Yes, Ma'am.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - DAY

               We hear a HARPSICHORD begin playing as a WIDER ANGLE reveals 
               a huge, magnificent room with vaulted ceilings thirty feet 
               high. Floor-to-ceiling windows. Hanging tapestries.

               VICTOR sits at the harpsichord, a very serious 7 year-old in 
               his little gentleman's suit and stiff starched collar.

               MRS. MORITZ, head of the housekeeping staff, conducts the 
               lesson. Her daughter JUSTINE, age 4, sits with her doll in a 
               huge wingback chair, making it dance to the music as she 
               listens... but her eyes are on Victor. She adores him.

               An enormous door swings open. Victor stops playing. His 
               PARENTS enter, ushering a somber and beautiful ELIZABETH, 
               age 6, across the vast expanse of floor. Victor slides off 
               the bench and faces them.

                                     FATHER
                         Mrs. Moritz, would you and your 
                         daughter excuse us?

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along, 
                         Justine. Bring your dolly.

               Mrs. Moritz takes Justine's hand. Justine gazes back at Victor 
               and Elizabeth as her mother whisks her off.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's 
                         coming to live with us.

                                     FATHER
                         She has lost her parents to scarlet 
                         fever. She is an orphan.

                                     MOTHER
                         You must think of her as your own 
                         sister. You must look after her. And 
                         be kind to her.

               Victor stares at Elizabeth. She returns the gaze evenly, 
               self-possessed and dignified even at this young age.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I loved her from the moment that I 
                         first saw her.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - NIGHT

               A MASSIVE BOLT OF LIGHTNING hammers from the sky, reducing a 
               centuries-old oak tree to smoldering ruin...

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               ...while Victor gazes at the storm, face pressed against a 
               window, astonished at the sight.

               Lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by 
                         the storm. Go comfort her.

               INT - UPPER LANDING - NIGHT

               We hear a CHILD SOBBING. Victor comes racing up the grand 
               staircase from below as LIGHTNING sends wild banister shadows 
               skittering. He caroms down the hall toward:

               INT - ELIZABETH'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Victor enters. Elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult-
               size bed, gazing up with tear-streaked face at the huge 
               skylights in the vaulted ceiling, dreading the next scary 
               boom and flash. Victor approaches and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't cry, Elizabeth.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (frightened)
                         Aren't you?

               KA-BOOM! A LIGHTNING BOLT rips overhead, rattling the panes 
               of glass. Victor does find it scary... but exhilarating.

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll build a fort. So the lightning 
                         can't get us.

               He races about the room, grabbing every pillow he can find 
               and hurling them to her. Big decorative pillows from the 
               chaise, bed pillows from the armoire... they all come flying. 
               She giggles as a big one knocks her flat. Victor scampers 
               onto the bed with her. They pile the pillows around and above, 
               concealing themselves in a bulging heap of cushions.

               INSIDE THE PILLOW-FORT

               Victor pokes his hand up, widening a space so they can still 
               see. Lightning glistens in their upturned eyes.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Are you sure it can't hurt us?

                                     VICTOR
                         Nothing can. Not ever.

               She seeks his hand. Fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

               TILT UP to the skylight. Rain drumming the glass...

               INT - MANSION - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth are learning to waltz, their movements 
               stiff and awkward, childlike. MRS. MORITZ is at the 
               harpsichord. Justine sits with her dolly, watching.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         You must lead, Victor. The lady will 
                         always look to you for guidance, so

               Victor and Elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast

               approaches manhood. Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful 
               beauty at 16. Mrs. Moritz is still conducting the lessons.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... 
                         Excellent! You'll be the envy of all 
                         the young ladies and gentlemen!

               They're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor 
               as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms. She isn't 
               concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard. Her mother throws 
               her a look of reproval:

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine. Surely you can maintain 
                         better time than that.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes, Mama.

               Flustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as 
               Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about 
               the room, their attention only on each other.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A skylight above us. A storm is raging, rain drumming the 
               glass. We hear SCREAMING in the house. TILT DOWN to Victor 
               perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension.

               Waiting. Elizabeth is with him. She squeezes his arm, trying 
               to reassure him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She'll be all right.

               Another SCREAM rips down the hallway. Justine comes scurrying 
               up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh 
               load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, 
               trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably 
               blocked by Mrs. Moritz.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         You can do nothing here. Wait 
                         downstairs.

               He can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing 
               and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended. His 
               father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her.

                                     VICTOR
                         Mother?

                                     FATHER
                         Victor, do as you're told!

               Justine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him. She 
               squeezes past into the room. The door slams in his face. He 
               turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror...

               INT - PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, 
               blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth...

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               ...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, 
               the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in 
               the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain.

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               VICTOR stares out the window at the raging storm. Elizabeth 
               appears at his side. He doesn't look at her.

                                     VICTOR
                         As a boy, I stood at this window and 
                         watched God destroy our tree.

               b.g. screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up 
               the grand staircase. The sudden silence is even more 
               frightening. The FAINT CRY of a newborn infant drifts down A 
               door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. Victor's 
               father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward 
               them. He pauses halfway down, unable to continue.

                                     VICTOR
                         Father?

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's 
               father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes 
               spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh God. The blood.

               Father sits down shakily on a step. Victor and Elizabeth 
               race up the stairs and pause before him.

                                     FATHER
                         I did everything I could.

               Victor lets out a sob of anguish. Elizabeth begins to cry.

               Father gathers them into his arms.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAY

               A BABY CARRIAGE stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic 
               and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace.

               A PRIEST recites a Latin burial mass. DOZENS OF MOURNERS are 
               gathered before the Frankenstein family mausoleum... an 
               imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought-iron, its 
               steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix.

               A sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers 
               and sorrow. The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark 
               against a steely gray sky. Victor and Elizabeth stand apart 
               from the others, staring at the casket. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         How could all my father's knowledge 
                         and skill fail to save her?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's not ours to decide. All that 
                         live must die. It's God's will.

               Victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the 
               mausoleum. Christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes

                                     VICTOR
                         What kind of God is He to will this?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She was mother to me as well. But 
                         ours is the job of the living. It's 
                         up to us now to hold this family 
                         together. We must think of Father 
                         and be strong for him.
                              (beat)
                         I cannot do that alone.

                                     VICTOR
                         God took her from us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He left a beautiful gift in her place. 
                         A baby boy. To cherish and love as 
                         our very own. Your brother

               Victor glances at the baby carriage. He seeks her hand. Their 
               fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

                                     VICTOR
                         Our brother.

               The baby starts CRYING as the casket is lowered, its thin 
               voice carried on the wind...

               EXT - MEADOW - DAY

               A gorgeous, sun-dappled day. Tall grass waving on the breeze. 
               Butterflies skittering. WILLIAM, 11 months-old, toddles into 
               view. He doesn't get far. PLOP! Down he goes, right on his 
               ass. His face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into 
               tears.

               Elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and 
               comforting him. Victor rises from a picnic blanket to join 
               them. Nanny Justine looks up from her task of laying out the 
               silverware and food.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Poor William! What indignant tears!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         There, there... shhh...

               Victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air. The 
               child shrieks and wails, held aloft.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, have a care! You'll make him 
                         dizzy!

                                     VICTOR
                         The world is a dizzying place.

               She tries to reclaim the baby. Victor feints, keeping Willie 
               out of reach. Elizabeth grows crosser:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh, do give him here! He needs to be 
                         comforted and held!

                                     VICTOR
                         He needs to vent his outrage to the 
                         skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! 
                         Learning to walk is not an easy thing! 
                         Why should it be so?

               Elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun 
               to laugh. She glares at both of them. Men.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         That's the nature of all progress, 
                         William. Don't let your brother sway 
                         you otherwise.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Quite right!

               Victor cradles Willie as if to shield his delicate ears. He 
               peers at Elizabeth with mock-grave suspicion and speaks to 
               the baby sotto-voce, in deepest confidence, man-to-man:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a 
                         feast to be consumed. Women would 
                         have you believe you must walk before 
                         you can run. Or run before you can 
                         waltz!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (laughing)
                         Give me that child before you fill 
                         his head with drivel!

               Victor waltzes the baby in circles. Elizabeth stalks them.

                                     VICTOR
                         Devil take walking, ladies! My brother 
                         shall learn to waltz!

               He grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it. There's no use 
               resisting. She succumbs and they dance with the baby between 
               them. Justine is gasping with laughter.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Scandalous! What would your dear 
                         mother say?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (thinks a beat)
                         One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl-
                         two-three...

               Laughing, Victor and Elizabeth waltz little William around 
               in a sweeping arc. They pass within inches of the CAMERA, 
               bodies wiping frame...

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT (6 YEARS LATER)

               To reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and 
               spectacle as a HUNDRED DANCERS swirl about the floor in a 
               breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble 
               (NOTE: The music here should be our movie's distinctive 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME, which will reoccur later.)

               Victor and Elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about 
               them in a blur. Now 24, he's in the prime of manhood.

               Elizabeth, 23, is a drop-dead beauty radiating poise and 
               intelligence. They're so right for each other, so beautiful 
               together, your heart could break just looking at them.

               Justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself. She's 
               at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone 
               would ask her to dance. William, now 7, scampers to her side. 
               She stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair. 
               Waltzing couples swirl past them.

                                     WILLIE
                         Auntie Justine, Papa said I could 
                         have a sweet.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You can. But not before dinner.

               The music ends amidst applause. The men bow to the ladies, 
               the ladies curtsy in return. Victor escorts Elizabeth off 
               the dance floor. Elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You dance so beautifully together.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         And you look so lovely.

               They share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile. The orchestra 
               recommences. The music is lush. Justine looks hopefully to 
               Victor, keeping her tone light:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor? Spare me one dance?

               Elizabeth catches Victor's eye.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite 
                         out of breath.

               Victor gallantly offers his arm. Justine takes it, lighting 
               up as he escorts her onto the dance floor ...

               ...and they begin to dance. She's glowing. This is a big 
               moment for her. But they've hardly begun, when...

               ...ting-ting-ting, Victor's father is tapping a champagne 
               glass with a knife. The dancers stop. The orchestra falls 
               silent. Justine hides her disappointment as servants pass 
               among the guests with glasses of champagne.

                                     FATHER
                         My friends, fatherly pride won't 
                         allow this occasion to pass without 
                         my raising a toast.

               Shouts of assent. Victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged 
               forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands.

                                     FATHER
                         To Victor. My son. Who read every 
                         medical book in my library by age 
                         thirteen... and then re-read them, 
                         which seemed excessive even to me.
                              (the guests ROAR with 
                              laughter)
                         Drape yourself in glory, my boy.  
                         Study well.  When you return, you 
                         return a man of medicine. I will 
                         then be honored to call you 
                         "colleague."

                                     VICTOR
                         But never your equal.

                                     FATHER
                         No. You'll surpass me.

               Applause and roars of approval. The drinks are tossed back.

               Victor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Music and warm light spill from the windows. A COUPLE eases 
               through a French door and come racing across the lawn, 
               giggling and hushing each other. They take refuge under a 
               tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: Victor and 
               Elizabeth. She leans against the trunk to catch her breath.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Smell the air. Wonderful.

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a send-off, isn't it?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Father's so proud.

                                     VICTOR
                         And you?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Prouder still. You'll be the 
                         handsomest student there.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll have to do better than that.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You will.
                              (searches his eyes)
                         What do you want, Victor?

                                     VICTOR
                         To be the best there ever was. To 
                         push our knowledge beyond our 
                         dreams... to eradicate disease and 
                         pestilence... to purge mankind of 
                         ignorance and fear...

               He's so serious, she can't help laugh.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm not mad.

               She smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No. Just very earnest. And very dear.

               An extended moment. Unspoken words flowing between them.

               Victor leans forward and kisses her. Her eyes widen slightly. 
               So do his. Shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief. 
               They pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes. He 
               whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         I've loved you all my life

                                     ELIZABETH
                         All my life I've known.

               They kiss again. A breath. A shiver.

                                     VICTOR
                         This feels... incestuous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is that what makes it so delicious?

               She brushes her lips against his. Gentle as a sigh.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister still?

                                     VICTOR
                         I wish to be your husband.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I wish to be your wife.

                                     VICTOR
                         Then come with me to Ingolstadt. 
                         Marry me now.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If only I could. But one of us must 
                         stay. Father's not strong. Willie's 
                         just a child. Who can look after 
                         them in your absence? Who can run 
                         the estate?

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I will be here when you return.

               Another kiss. Turning lustful and steamy. They melt into 
               each other, sinking down, bodies pressing and minds afire.

               These people are hot for each other. They stop, stunned at 
               the intensity. He lays his head to her breast. Their fingers 
               clasp. She whispers her secret:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         My head is spinning. I want to give 
                         myself to you.

               He raises his head. She meets his gaze evenly

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If we're to be married, must we wait?

               He touches her face. Fingertips tracing downward, gentle and 
               reverent, brushing the contours of her bosom at the edge of 
               her bodice. She shivers. Closes her eyes. Lays her hand over 
               his. Guiding his touch.

                                     VICTOR
                         You make me weak.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Not as weak as I.

               She raises his hand to her mouth. Brushing his fingertips 
               with her lips. Wrestling with desire. Their eyes meet.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Our decision. Together.

                                     VICTOR
                         Your decision. For us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (hesitates)
                         I give you my soul...

                                     VICTOR
                              (nods)
                         ...until our wedding night. When our 
                         bodies will join.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor. I love you,

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. My more than sister.

               They kiss again. Gently...

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAWN

               A misty gray dawn. Victor is kneeling at a gravestone, 
               observing a moment of silence. His saddled horse is tethered 
               nearby. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll make you so proud, Mother.

               He lays a small sprig of flowers on the grave, rises and 
               walks toward his horse.

               EXT - MANSION - MORNING

               Overcast and chill. An open carriage stands loaded. The family 
               and household staff have turned out. Victor stands ready to 
               go. Father pulls him into a back-slapping embrace.

                                     FATHER
                         Write to us often.

               Victor moves on to Justine, takes her hand.

                                     VICTOR
                         We never finished our dance.
                              (she smiles)
                         Someday we shall.

               Next is William. The little boy stands stiffly, tears on his 
               face, trying to be brave. Victor kneels and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         The others will look to you while 
                         I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.

               The boy nods miserably, throws his arms around Victor's neck. 
               Last comes Elizabeth. She and Victor regard each other, 
               sharing the secret of last night. A faint smile plays at the 
               corners of her mouth. He kisses her cheek.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               He mounts the carriage. CLAUDE snaps the reins and lurches 
               away, speeding Victor off to his future. Victor turns back 
               for a final look at the home and family he loves so much.

               William runs after him until he's gone from sight...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INGOLSTADT - ESTABLISHING ANGLES - DAY

               High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. Church steeples 
               rising among the rooftops. Beautiful.

               BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               FRAU BRACH trudges heavily up a long, steep, narrow flight 
               of stairs with Victor teetering uneasily behind.

                                     FRAU BRACH
                         No real rooms left. All we've got is 
                         attic space. No one ever wants the 
                         attic space...

               ATTIC SPACE/GARRET - DAY

               She leads him into an immensely long space running a twisted 
               path the entire length of the building; various levels and 
               areas unhindered by wall separation, massive vaulted beams 
               crisscrossing as understructure to the roof. Daylight filters 
               dimly through dozens of dormer windows and skylights coated 
               with grime. Nooks and crannies abound.

                                     VICTOR
                         This will do nicely.

               UNIVERSITY - DAY

               A monumental structure of brick. A BELL TOWER TOLLS. Dead 
               leaves scurry across the lawn.

               LECTURE HALL - DAY

               PROFESSOR KREMPE, a squat little man, paces before the packed 
               galleries of eager young STUDENTS.

                                     KREMPE
                         In science, the letter of fact is 
                         the letter of law. Our pursuit is as 
                         dogmatic as any religious precept. 
                         Think of yourselves as disciples of 
                         a strict and hallowed sect. Someday 
                         you may be priests... but only if 
                         you learn the scripture chapter and 
                         verse.
                              (off their laughter)
                         Any questions?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hand shoots up)
                         But surely, Professor, you don't 
                         intend we disregard the more... 
                         philosophical works.

                                     KREMPE
                         Philosophical?

                                     VICTOR
                         Those which stir the imagination as 
                         well as the intellect. Paracelsus, 
                         for one.

               This reference is lost on all but a few. At the faculty table: 
               PROFESSOR WALDMAN peers up at Victor, adjusting the glasses 
               on his nose. Up among the students: HENRY CLERVAL leans out 
               and shoots an amused look in Victor's direction.

               SCHILLER catches Henry's look and rolls his eyes.

                                     KREMPE
                         Paracelsus?

                                     VICTOR
                         Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius 
                         Agrippa...

                                     KREMPE
                         What is your name?

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor Frankenstein, sir.
                              (no response)
                         Of geneva.

                                     KREMPE
                         Of Geneva.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. 
                         Do you wish to study medicine? Or 
                         mysticism?

               Titters sweep the room. Krempe remains staunchly unamused:

                                     KREMPE
                         Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. 
                         Frankenstein's suggested reading 
                         list... thankfully, that would be 
                         most of you... would be well advised 
                         to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we 
                         concern ourselves with immutable 
                         reality...
                              (specific to Victor)
                         ...not the ravings of lunatics and 
                         alchemists hundreds of years in their 
                         graves. Understood?

               Victor is flushed and humiliated. Held like to say more, but 
               wisely swallows his anger and nods.

                                     KREMPE
                         I am relieved. Are there any relevant 
                         questions?
                              (there are none)
                         Lecture hall dismissed.

               EXT - UNIVERSITY - DAY

               Victor exits wearing a distinctive black greatcoat, fuming 
               over the exchange with Krempe. He strides across the lawn, 
               eyes fixed straight ahead.

               Henry Clerval races up behind him and falls casually in step. 
               Victor glances over. Henry nods pleasantly, as if held been 
               there all along. Victor responds with a curt nod and resumes 
               his straight-ahead demeanor. They walk in silence, just two 
               guys heading in the same direction.

               Henry can't help it; he snickers loudly to himself. Victor 
               shoots him a sharp look. Henry's smirk vanishes, replaced 
               with blank innocence. Did somebody snicker?

                                     HENRY
                         I was just clearing my throat.

                                     VICTOR
                         Very well then.

               They continue walking. Silence thick. Finally:

                                     HENRY
                         You know, you're quite mad.

               Victor stops. Turns.

                                     VICTOR
                              (low, measured)
                         I am not mad.

                                     HENRY
                              (matching Victor's 
                              tone)
                         As a march hare.

               Henry's expression betrays nothing... but perhaps there's a 
               trace of amusement in his eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you having me on?

                                     HENRY
                         Of course I am. It pays to humor the 
                         insane.

               Beat. Victor smiles. Henry grins, offers his hand. Takes it.

                                     HENRY
                         Henry Clerval.

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor, Victor Frankenstein.

                                     HENRY
                         I know. You have a way of making an 
                         impression.

               INT - GASTHOF - DUSK

               The tavern is packed with students and noise. Beer and food 
               served at a frantic pace. We find Victor and Henry at a small 
               table, tearing into sausages and cheese.

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you really think I'm mad?

                                     HENRY
                         Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing 
                         you know, you'll be teaching 
                         toadstools to speak.

               Schiller enters with FRIENDS. They pause at Victor's table

                                     SCHILLER
                         If it isn't the sorcerer. Found 
                         yourself an apprentice?

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm afraid I rejected his application. 
                         He merely dabbles.

                                     HENRY
                         Dilettantes need not apply. What 
                         about you? Schiller, isn't it?

                                     SCHILLER
                         Von Schiller. I'm interested in real 
                         medicine. Treating the sick.

                                     HENRY
                         Really? I myself find sick people 
                         rather revolting.
                              (off their looks)
                         I'm here to secure my degree with a 
                         minimum of fuss and hard work that I 
                         might settle into a life of privilege 
                         treating rich old ladies with gout 
                         and dallying with their daughters.

                                     SCHILLER
                         You two disgust me.

               Schiller and his friends stalk off.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT - DUSK

               LONG LENS magnificently compresses buildings and steeples, 
               distant hills and drizzly sky. Victor wears his greatcoat as 
               he and Henry walk along a twisty cobblestone street.

                                     VICTOR
                         Rich old ladies and their daughters?

                                     HENRY
                         Can you think of a better reason?

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a few.

                                     HENRY
                         Do me a favor then...
                              (claps his shoulder)
                         ...keep them to yourself.

               Victor takes a shocked beat and bursts into laughter.

               INT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

               Waldman, in sinock, addresses a GROUP OF STUDENTS from across 
               morgue slab. He throws a sheet back to reveal a corpse 
               dissected to reveal the inner workings. The others crowd for 
               a closer look. Victor glances to Henry, who leans back and 
               rolls his eyes in utter disgust.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor sitting at a tall dormer window, 
               writing a letter with quill and ink. It's raining outside. 
               The garret is tidied.

               EXT - RYE FIELDS - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               WORKERS are harvesting for miles around. PAN to Elizabeth 
               and Claude examining the sheaves on a wagon. She cracks the 
               grain and tastes it, glances to Claude. He smiles and nods.

                                     CLAUDE
                         It's turning out to be a good year.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let's return a tenth of the crop to 
                         the tenants.
                              (off his look)
                         They had a hard winter.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Not even your father would be that 
                         generous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Then there's no need to tell him, is 
                         there?

               Claude grins and motions to his MEN. They resume loading the 
               sheaves as a STABLEBOY rides up:

                                     STABLEBOY
                         Miss! The mail arrived! There's one 
                         from Master Victor!

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN PARLOR - NIGHT

               We find the family gathered around the fire as Elizabeth 
               reads Victor's letter aloud:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         ...and not a day goes by that I do 
                         not cherish your faces in my mind's 
                         eye or ache to see you all again. Be 
                         assured that I am with you in spirit, 
                         and you are never far from my 
                         thoughts. I remain, as always, your 
                         loving and devoted Victor. P.S.

               She pauses, reading ahead.

               INSERT OF LETTER

               The P.S. reads: "Elizabeth... I am holding our vow precious 
               in my heart."

               ELIZABETH

               glances up at their expectant faces.

                                     WILLIE
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It says, give Willie an extra big 
                         hug for me.

                                     WILLIAM
                              (beaming)
                         Read it again?

               She smiles, rearranges the pages as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - UNIVERSITY HALLWAY - DAY

               A classroom door. SHOUTING from within:

                                     VICTOR (O.S.)
                         That's no excuse for being a pompous 
                         ass!

               Victor storms out with Krempe at his heels. Krempe pauses in 
               the doorway, red-faced, bellowing after him:

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll see you thrown out of this 
                         university! I'll go to the dean 
                         himself! Take me at my word, 
                         Frankenstein! The dean himself!

               Classroom doors are opening, faces peering out. Waldman among 
               them. Victor keeps going, doesn't look back.

               INT - GASTHOF - NIGHT

               Victor and Henry slouched at their regular table writes in 
               his thick, well-worn leather journal.

                                     HENRY
                         The entire school heard it. It wasn't 
                         something one could miss.

                                     VICTOR
                         You're a comfort to me, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         What now? Writing about it in your 
                         journal won't help.

                                     VICTOR
                              (quietly)
                         It's a letter to my father.

               Henry falls silent. Victor closes the journal, winds it secure 
               with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of 
               his greatcoat. Brooding. The bell above the door JINGLES. A 
               gust of wind sweeps in. They glance up. Professor Waldman 
               enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous. He 
               murmurs a pleasantry to the INNKEEPER and drifts over to 
               Victor's table.

                                     VICTOR
                         Professor Waldman.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (takes a seat)
                         Victor, explain yourself.

                                     VICTOR
                         Krempe has a way of provoking my 
                         temper.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You have a way of provoking his.
                              (beat)
                         I've been watching you. You seem 
                         impatient with your studies.

                                     VICTOR
                         To say the least. I came here to 
                         expand my mind, but honest inquiry 
                         seems strangled at every turn. All 
                         we do is cling to the old knowledge 
                         instead of seeking the new.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You disdain accepted wisdom?

                                     VICTOR
                         No, I embrace it... as something to 
                         be used or discarded as we advance 
                         the boundaries of what is known.

                                     HENRY
                              (mutters to Waldman)
                         Now you've got him started.

                                     VICTOR
                         These are exciting times, Henry. 
                         We're entering an era of amazing 
                         breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. 
                         He wasn't content to bleed people 
                         with leeches, he pioneered a new 
                         frontier of thought

                                     HENRY
                         ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox 
                         has been virtually eliminated. I've 
                         heard this speech before.

                                     VICTOR
                         But you haven't listened, Never in 
                         history has so much seemed possible. 
                         We're on the verge of answers undreamt 
                         of... but only if we have the courage 
                         to ask the questions.

                                     WALDMAN
                         I understand your frustration. I was 
                         young once myself.
                              (beat)
                         Walk me home. Something I'd like to 
                         show you.

               INT - WALDMAN'S HOME - WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               The gaslights come up with a SOFT HISS. The first thing Victor 
               and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to 
               big windows where the light would be best during the day. 
               Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of 
               subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, 
               all quite excellent.

               The rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter 
               with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up 
               his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of 
               tables crammed with experiments and clutter.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You know for thousands of years the 
                         Chinese have based their medical 
                         science on the belief that the human 
                         body is a chemical engine run by 
                         electricity? They say we all contain 
                         streams of energy which flow through 
                         us like currents in the ocean, or 
                         rivers in the earth.

               They arrive at a table. Waldman roots through a tray of 
               knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Their doctors treat patients by 
                         inserting needles like these into 
                         the flesh at various key points to 
                         manipulate these electric streams.

                         I once saw it done, as a boy in 
                         Canton. My parents were missionaries. 
                         The cure was nothing short of 
                         miraculous.
                              (off their looks)
                         I've never forgotten it. Been 
                         fascinated ever since.

                                     HENRY
                         It smacks of magic.

               Waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal 
               an enormous dead toad in dissection. Copper mounting pins 
               trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in 
               turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries.

               Waldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as 
               the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as 
               Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet 
               flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?

               Waldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm 
               at the array of wires and batteries.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Electricity.

                         sort of thing I'm talking about! We 
                         should be learning this!

                         Why? God alone knows what it means. 
                         Until it has proven value, it's 
                         nothing more than a ghoulish parlor 
                         trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.

                                     VICTOR
                         But the possibilities. Combining 
                         ancient knowledge with new? Something 
                         like this could change our fundamental 
                         views!

                         It is a thrilling direction to 
                         explore. Thrilling and dangerous.

                         Nature can be wonderful and terrible. 
                         Science is not a realm for the 
                         reckless; it needs a conscience. We 
                         must proceed cautiously. Assess as 
                         we go.

                         I doubt that decision is still mine 
                         to make.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (waves)
                         Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an 
                         apology to Professor Krempe...

               Victor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a 
               stern gesture for silence. Listen.

                                     WALDMAN
                         "...a sincere and heartfelt apology 
                         which you will then read aloud to 
                         him before the assembled student 
                         body and faculty.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (draws close)
                         Our profession needs talent like 
                         yours. Destroy your career over an 
                         issue of pride? What a waste.

               Waldman hands him the acupuncture needle. A gift. Victor 
               studies it, fascinated.

                                     WALDMAN

                         him was both rash and inexcusable.

               her attention between supervising and reading Victor's letter, 
               while Justine busies herself with a flower arrangement. Willie 
               gets underfoot. Father just sits.

               Waldman leans close to observe. Softly:

               With Waldman at his side and Henry providing the tools as 
               needed, Victor instructs a freshman class in the internal 
               workings of a dissected corpse. Professor Krempe observes 
               from a distance.

                                     VICTOR

               He waves them dismissed. They laugh and exit, relieved.

               Waldman squeezes Victor's elbow. Well done. Victor stiffens 
               at Krempe's approach.

                                     KREMPE
                         You seem to be adapting well to the

                         Despite the lack of challenge.

               Krempe reddens, but says nothing. He gives Waldman a curt 
               nod and walks off.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

                                     VICTOR
                         The strain was evident.

                                     HENRY
                         Come now, you must take some 
                         satisfaction. You've risen to the 
                         top of your class. A position of 
                         prominence and regard.

               Victor weighs this, glances at both of them, smiles.

                                     VICTOR
                         What keeps me going are my friends.

               He throws his arm around Henry's neck, pulls him into an 
               affectionate headlock. Henry struggles and laughs:

                                     HENRY

               dangled before him by a smiling JEWELER. He glances to Henry 
               for an opinion.

                                     HENRY

                              (pointedly to jeweler)
                         ...to justify these prices.

               The jeweler's smile goes frosty.

               WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               TIGHT ANGLE ON the locket lying open against canvas, dangling 
               from an easel frame. TILT DOWN to reveal a magnificent 
               miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than 
               three inches high within its penciled oval.

               Waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, 
               jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally 
               large behind the magnifying lenses. Victor sits patiently 
               for the portrait, suffused with daylight.

               Henry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. 
               Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. He clearly 
               hates people looking over his shoulder.

                                     HENRY
                              (deadpan)
                         Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?

               Waldman heaves a long-suffering sigh. He abruptly jabs his 
               brush at Henry's nose, daubing it with paint. Dignity upheld 
               he resumes his careful work as Victor laughs.

               Victor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains 
               of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's 
               company. Cigars are lit, wine is flowing. Conversation is 
               fast and loose, intense and passionate:

                         I'm quite serious. Look at all the 
                         charity and clinic work we do. Up 
                         until thirty years ago, the concept 
                         of vaccine was unheard of.

                                     HENRY
                         You're saying all disease will 
                         eventually be eradicated?

                                     WALDMAN
                         I'm convinced. Not by treating 
                         symptoms, but by diving nature's 
                         most jealously-guarded secrets.

                                     HENRY
                              (turning serious)
                         Do you foresee this happening in our 
                         lifetimes?

                                     WALDMAN
                         No. But someday.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.

               A HOWL OF OUTRAGE AND LAUGHTER. Victor flings his napkin in 
               Henry's face.

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you would think of that!

                                     HENRY
                              (laughing)
                         Somebody has to!

               Victor raises his wine glass. The others join. A toast.

                                     VICTOR
                         I tell you what we need, my friends. 
                         Forget the symptoms and diseases. 
                         What we need is a vaccine for death 
                         itself.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (laughter)
                         Oh, now you have gone too far. There's 
                         only one God, Victor.

                                     HENRY
                              (raises his glass)
                         And here's to Him. Everything in 
                         moderation, Frankenstein.

                                     VICTOR
                              (grins)
                         Nothing in moderation, Clerval.

               INT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               CAMERA, TRACKS the gritty reality of a big-city poor house, 
               crammed with society's dregs: the poor, the uneducated, 
               wailing babies, stampeding children. Absolutely jangling 
               with noise and confusion... loud and stifling... people 
               getting eye-ear-nose-throat exams... being vaccinated...

               The "doctors" in attendance are all Ingolstadt STUDENTS 
               performing community service, none of whom look like they're 
               enjoying it. Schiller looks particularly harried. We find 
               Victor and Henry giving out vaccinations. They keep glancing 
               over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled 
               in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced MAN terrified 
               about getting his vaccination:

                                     MAN
                         Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox 
                         in it, I hear tell!

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Pox? They givin' us pox?

               Ripples of panic spread. Waldman is as tense and clipped as 
               we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper 
               amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad-lib dialogue:

                                     WALDMAN
                         No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Vaca-what?

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...vaccine, from the Latin vacca, 
                         meaning cow
                              (glances at her girth)
                         ...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...

                                     MAN
                         I told you there was pox in it!

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...no, no, cowpox in a minute 
                         quantity, perfectly harmless, gives 
                         you a natural immunity to small ox, 
                         which is the point of this whole 
                         bloody exercise...

               Victor and Henry are pausing work. Concerned. Drifting closer. 
               The ferret-faced man is cornered.

                                     MAN
                         You doctors kill people! I don' care 
                         what you say, you ain't stickin' it 
                         in me!

                                     WALDMAN
                         I most assuredly am! It prevents 
                         disease and it's the law! Why am I 
                         explaining myself? Somebody restrain 
                         this damn fool!

               It happens this fast: There's an innocuous blur of motion as 
               the man seems to tap Waldman lightly in the stomach, then he 
               darts away, slamming past Victor and Henry. Victor looks 
               after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. 
               He glances down. A thin knife. Victor looks to Waldman. 
               Puzzled. It still hasn't really dawned.

               Waldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed 
               to his sternum, lips tight. He looks more annoyed than 
               anything else. He exhales slowly.

                                     HENRY
                         Professor?

                                     WALDMAN
                              (softly)
                         Oh God.

               That's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers. 
               They catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls 
               to the floor. People are pushing and crowding to see.

               EXT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               A cobblestoned street-scene. Carriage. A delivery wagon. 
               Vendors. Pedestrians. The doors of the poor house burst open, 
               releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying 
               Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running 
               alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at 
               their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians 
               scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, 
               bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for 
               help...

               INT - UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - DAY

               Krempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket. The chapel 
               is full. Victor is seated near the back. Dazed. Henry comes 
               up the aisle and slides in next to him. Victor doesn't even 
               glance over. Henry whispers:

                                     HENRY
                         They just caught the man who did it.

                                     VICTOR
                         He was a frightened soul who acted 
                         out of fear and ignorance.

                                     HENRY
                         They'll hang him all the same.

                                     VICTOR
                         Good. I'll be there to hear his 
                         worthless neck snap.

               People glance back. Henry lays his hand on Victor's elbow.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep your voice down. You don't know 
                         what you're saying.

                                     VICTOR
                         It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't 
                         have happened! The bastard deserves 
                         to die.

               Victor is causing ripples of attention throughout the chapel. 
               Even Krempe falters briefly in his eulogy. Henry pulls Victor 
               from the pew, drags him up the aisle...

               INT - CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY

               ...and into the confessional where they launch at each other 
               in harsh whispers.

               Dialogue here is overlapping and intense:

                                     HENRY
                         You're making a scene!

                                     VICTOR
                         Why Waldman? He of all people should 
                         have cheated death!

                                     HENRY
                         You can't. Death is God's will!

                                     VICTOR
                         I resent God's monopoly.

                                     HENRY
                         That's blasphemy!

                                     VICTOR
                         Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent 
                         his life trying to help people!

                                     HENRY
                         All the more reason for us to continue 
                         his work with the poor!

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat, low)
                         No. He had more important work.

                                     HENRY
                         There are sick people who need our 
                         help. Here and now. Not in some future 
                         time. Consider that.

               Henry exits. Victor tries to compose himself, clasping his 
               hands together as if in prayer... or quiet rage. He gazes 
               up. There on the wall hangs a crucifix.

                                     VICTOR
                         Life and death.
                              (beat)
                         Why should You alone have the final 
                         say?

               VICTOR'S POV PUSHING SLOWLY IN on the Christ figure before 
               him, bleeding from a crown of thorns, arms thrown wide.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               DA VINCI'S STUDY OF MAN rises from the image of Christ, 
               striking an eerily similar pose, arms thrown wide within the 
               perfect circle. We hear a DOOR BEING UNLOCKED as...

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               ...a WIDER ANGLE reveals the deserted workshop. The door 
               swings open as Victor lets himself in. He sees the finished 
               locket lying open on a table, picks it up, studies the 
               beautiful miniature portrait it contains. Snaps it shut.

               He looks up, eyes falling upon the Da Vinci print hanging on 
               the wall. He stares. Intense.

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               TRACKING SHOT: Things are in the process of being sorted and 
               boxed. We find Victor poring over Waldman's notes:

                                     VICTOR
                         To understand the causes of life, we 
                         must first have recourse to death... 
                         and examine the process in minutest 
                         detail...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               A gray day. Waldman's ferret-faced MURDERER stands weeping 
               helplessly on the scaffold as sentence is read:

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         ...his body to be left on public 
                         display for a twenty-four hour period, 
                         thereafter to be consigned to an 
                         unmarked pauper's grave. So the court 
                         has spoken.

               The EXECUTIONER draws the hood over the murderer's head, 
               cinches the noose tight. The condemned man is blubbering, 
               pleading for his life.

               Victor stands in the crowd. Watching. Waiting. We hear the 
               THUMP of the body dropping, the CRACK of a snapping neck...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               Dark as Hades. Pissing down rain. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING and a 
               CRASH OF THUNDER. The dead man still hangs from the scaffold, 
               lashed by the wind.

               Victor looms from the storm, hands jammed in the pocket of 
               his greatcoat. He pulls out a thin, glittering blade. The 
               very weapon which took Waldman's life. He gazes up at the 
               dead man... at the rope from which he dangles...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The dead murderer lies pale and naked on a slab. Victor leans 
               close, still dripping, studying the face closely. A FLASH OF 
               LIGHTNING throws wild, skittering shadows through the dormer 
               windows and skylights. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         No longer pathetic and useless

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               The dead man, dissected and wired, jerks bolt upright, 
               flopping and convulsing, eyes opening and closing, mouth 
               gaping open and shut. He falls back limply as Victor shuts 
               the power off, making careful notations in his journal.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               TRACKING the dissection table... up the length of the 
               murderer's body... now in an advanced stage of decay... we 
               hear the SOFT BUZZING of flies...

               We find Victor standing over the corpse. Gaunt and hollow- 
               eyed. Exhausted and obsessed. Wearing a butcher's apron. 
               Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms. Maggots are 
               swarming in the flesh. He abruptly raises a cleaver and WHACKS 
               it off at the elbow.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING SLOWLY past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we 
               find Victor performing an intense chemical analysis. Dead 
               tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a 
               slow-burning flame. Victor smears a glass slide, places it 
               under a microscope.

               INT - GASTHOF - DAY

               Victor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, 
               scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form. 
               Henry is across from him:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor. This has got to stop.
                              (Victor glances up)
                         Nobody's seen you in months. You 
                         haven't attended a single class.

                                     VICTOR
                         I've been preoccupied.

                                     HENRY
                         We all know how hard you took 
                         Waldman's death. Even Krempe is 
                         sympathetic. But it is time to move 
                         on. It is time to concern yourself 
                         with life.

                                     VICTOR
                         That is my concern.
                              (faint smile)
                         I'm involved in something just now. 
                         I want to finish it in Waldman's 
                         memory.

                                     HENRY
                         How much longer?

                                     VICTOR
                         Few months perhaps. I'm gathering 
                         the raw materials even now.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               The wrought-iron doors of a crypt have been forced open.

               CAMERA PUSHES through to find Victor standing inside over a 
               stone sarcophagus with a pry bar in his hands. He's nervous, 
               working up his courage:

                                     VICTOR
                         Materials. That's all they are Tissue 
                         to be re-used.

               He pries off the stone lid. It THUMPS heavily to the floor, 
               cracking in half. He opens the casket, reaches in, raises 
               the pale arm of the deceased to inspect it.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Stone monuments. Bare trees. Ivy-covered ground. Victor 
               shoulder-deep in a grave. Shoveling. A lamp burns low.

               COFFIN - NIGHT

               Pitch black. The lid swings open, cascading dust and soil. 
               Victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING ALONG the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde 
               jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional 
               head staring through the glass, dead cats...

               ...and we find Victor working into the wee hours. Hunched 
               over his specimens. Candle flame flickering low. Referring 
               back to Waldman's notes. Making notations in arcane books 
               such as "De Occulta Philosophia," by Agrippa, and "Le Sciences 
               et les arts D'alchimiste," by Paracelsus.

               FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               A magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue 
               sky. TILT DOWN to Elizabeth and Justine with the mansion 
               distant. A steady breeze ripples the fields as Elizabeth 
               regards a stack of mail.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Nothing. Still nothing.

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's been months. It's not like him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Something's wrong. I know it.
                              (off her look)
                         I've heard rumors of cholera spreading 
                         south from Hamburg.

                                     JUSTINE
                         So have I

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I should go. I should leave today.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into 
                         Germany would be banned. You'd never 
                         get near Ingolstadt.
                              (beat)
                         Besides, they're only rumors.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (beat, nods)
                         And not a word of them to Father. 
                         He's agitated enough not hearing 
                         from Victor.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Read him one of the old letters and 
                         rephrase it. We'll say it came today. 
                         It'll set his mind at ease.

               Elizabeth gives her a hug. They walk toward the mansion

               INT - BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               Murky and dark. Bellows are pumping. Showers of sparks 
               cascade. The BLACKSMITH and his ASSISTANT are pounding a 
               metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet 
               into shape. Victor enters. The blacksmith directs his 
               attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the 
               wall. Victor runs his hand over the surface. Nice.

               INT - MATERNITY WARD - CHARITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               A WOMAN lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor. 
               Her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket. One of the 
               ASSISTANTS snatches it up, scurries around the corner. Victor 
               is waiting in the shadows. Money changes hands.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor is examining the amniotic fluid. Boiling it off. 
               Working to synthesize it.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be 
               a large copper vat. He dips his hand in, examines the 
               consistency and smell. ANGLE WIDENS, spinning slowly up to 
               reveal that the vat is human in shape. A sarcophagus.

               EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               We find Victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, 
               checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands. A PAIR OF MEN 
               lurk in the shadows, waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                         That one.

               The corpse is lifted off. Money changes hands.

                                     MAN
                         With this cholera come to town, we'll 
                         have plenty more for you.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor wearing elbow-length gloves, hacking furiously away 
               with a bone saw. Tossing aside the scraps.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor has an arm wired, testing reactions. He scrapes off a 
               small shred of tissue, drops it in solution, watches it break 
               apart. It doesn't look good. He glances feverishly at the 
               clock, makes a fast decision, scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Not optimal. Must use. No time to 
                         replace. Body can't wait.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor stitches a torso with one of those big, awful curved 
               needles, yanking up hard to draw the catgut tight.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I stitched it together with my own 
                         hands...

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pulls on a chain, hoisting the body off the slab via 
               block-and-tackle mounted on a ceiling track. The body rises 
               limply into the air, spinning slowly, arms and legs dangling, 
               long black hair covering its face.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         A patchwork man of my own devising.

               Victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning.

               He pushes it down the length of the lab, rolling it along 
               its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The Creature lies on an improvised bier of crates, surrounded 
               by shadows and clutter, draped/sprawled like Christ taken 
               from the cross in Michelangelo's "Pieta."

               Beakers bubbling and dripping. Intravenous lines seeping and 
               secreting. A misty chemical haze in the air.  Victor is 
               watching his patchwork man. Glowering. Waiting.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         It took nutrients like a child 
                         receiving milk... blushed like a 
                         young girl with the blood I forced 
                         through its veins...

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips through the skylights, bathing the 
               scene purple/white. Eerier and eerier.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         ...all in preparation.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               We find Victor passed out in a chair. His creation is still 
               taking fluids. Gray daylight streams through the windows.

               There's commotion in the street outside: shouting, horses' 
               hooves clattering on cobblestone, an occasional scream or 
               wail. Victor doesn't stir. Dead to the world. Somebody starts 
               POUNDING on the door. Victor rouses, takes a moment to 
               remember where he is. He lurches from his chair, grabs a 
               canvas tarp, throws it over his "patchwork man."

               STAIRWELL - DAY

               Henry is pounding. Finally the latch is drawn. The door swings 
               open a crack. Victor peers out. Gaunt and furtive. Suspicious. 
               Henry is stunned at his dissipated appearance.

                                     HENRY
                         God's sake, what is that stench?

               Henry peers past him.

               Victor shifts, blocking his view

                                     VICTOR
                         This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy 
                         just now. What do you want?

                                     HENRY
                         Things have gone worse with this 
                         cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases 
                         a day now. Classes have been 
                         suspended. University's shut down.

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes? And?

                                     HENRY
                         Listen to what I'm saying. The 
                         militia's arriving to quarantine the 
                         city. Most of us are getting out 
                         while we still can.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'll be leaving then.
                              (beat)
                         Just as well. You never were cut out 
                         for this, Henry. Goodbye.

               And the door slams shut. The bolt is thrown. Henry pounds.

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO 
                         REASON!

               Nothing. Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and 
               heads back down the stairs.

               EXT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - STREET - DAY

               Henry exits into a nightmare. REFUGEES are streaming from 
               the city, horses and wagons, people on foot, carrying their 
               possessions. Henry steps into the street and is nearly run 
               down by a carriage.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         OUT OF THE WAY!

               Henry glances up to see Schiller at the reins, struggling to 
               control the animals as the carriage eases past.

                                     HENRY
                         Schiller? You're leaving? Where's 
                         all that high talk about treating 
                         the sick?

                                     SCHILLER
                              (icy)
                         To hell with them. And you.

               He snaps the reins, not caring who he runs down. The carriage 
               lurches away, scattering refugees before it.

               Henry keeps walking. Jostled by the hostile crowd. Looking 
               around. Dazed. Dead bodies are stacked along the street like 
               cordwood, waiting for the death carts. ANGLE WIDENS as Henry 
               stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned 
               at the human suffering around him as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor glances at the clock. Scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Time running out. Rate of decay 
                         accelerating. Must strike now... or 
                         start again from scratch.

               He gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab 
               before him... but now the Creature lies on a full body-length 
               steel grate. Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling 
               above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped 
               with glittering needles big enough to knit with.

               Victor glances up at the Da Vinci. The Study of Man has been 
               daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. Victor dips 
               a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing 
               identical marks on the body before him...

               Now he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these 
               spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good 
               contact. The forearms, the neck, the rib cage...

               Now he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners 
               of the steel grate...

               Now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig 
               into the air. It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, 
               wires and all...

               HIGH WIDE ANGLE

               ...and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's 
               gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab. The Creature 
               dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length 
               and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick 
               copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and 
               neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, 
               coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary 
               slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous 
               array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. 

               Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward 
               the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly 
               above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all 
               unlike the Da Vinci...

               And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it 
               spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding 
               in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it 
               along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after 
               table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING 
               BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and 
               sinister shadows...

               ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper 
               sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He 
               positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature 
               down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the 
               steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape.

               Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, 
               unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- 
               tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, 
               grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also 
               suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with 
               reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he 
               swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place 
               with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, 
               spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the 
               sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster.

               The frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, 
               zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear:

               Frankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking 
               the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble.

               Frankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes 
               checking on his creation drifting in the murk.

               Frankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, 
               supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they 
               send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables 
               along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge.

               Frankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING 
               painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. 
               Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle.

               Over it goes. WHAM! Overdrive.

               The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first 
               jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with 
               energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through 
               the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking.

               Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, 
               two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on 
               a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam 
               wrenched out like a Polaroid plate.

               He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going 
               knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- 
               tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. 
               And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this 
               twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, 
               with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming 
               phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, 
               wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm...

               EEL POV (IN THE TUBE)

               ...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster 
               and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the 
               creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless 
               gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage. 
               The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to 
               side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open 
               and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges.

               Frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, 
               watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child.

                                     VICTOR
                              (muffled through the 
                              glass)
                         Live, you bastard!

               A huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing 
               and spasming against the glass.

               FRANKENSTEIN jerks his head back, stunned. The fingers are 
               scratching. He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting 
               the whole thing down. It cycles off, whining into silence

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp 
               and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off.

               FRANKENSTEIN stares at the sarcophagus. Realizing his creation 
               has stopped moving. Nothing now. He sags to his knees, utterly 
               devastated at the loss of his dream. Nothing.

               It was all for nothing...

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. Its 
               mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries 
               to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid.

               FRANKENSTEIN is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his 
               hands. A SOFT TAP. He glances over his fingers. Thinking he 
               imagined it. No. There's another tap. And another.

               We see it in his eyes. Sheer joy and stunned exultation.

               Triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's alive. It's alive.

               And then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the 
               sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. THUMP- 
               THUMP-THUMP! Pounding from within. Head ramming against the 
               inner lid. He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the 
               wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning 
               man within. He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope 
               to hoist the lid away...

               ...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled 
               from below with rocket-booster force. The massive copper 
               shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, 
               demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and 
               thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry 
               and splintering coat rack. Victor's greatcoat goes flying.

               Silence. Frankenstein is frozen. Staring at the roiling 
               surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. An eternity 
               passes in the space of a heartbeat.

               The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, 
               thrashing and gagging. Murky fluid cascading in all 
               directions. The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, 
               trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding 
               like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging 
               Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with 
               electricity. Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying 
               to break the Creature's grip...

               ...and the whole thing tips over. Victor reels back, falling 
               as the vat SLAMS to the ground, cascading its murky contents, 
               washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body 
               tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping 
               electrical discharges into the air. Victor scrambles back, 
               slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking 
               his legs away. He finds his traction and scrambles to his 
               feet.

               The Creature is grasping and crawling toward him. Flopping 
               and jerking. Gripped by seizures and convulsions. Vomiting 
               murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the 
               fluid. Swiping the air with palsied hands. Malfunctional.

               VICTOR stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring 
               down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife 
               to this ghastly birth. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         What have I done?

               The Creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching 
               his clothes, pawing him.

                                     VICTOR
                         LET GO OF ME!

               Victor can't break free. Panicking. He snatches a hammer 
               from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's 
               head. THUD! Again and again. Beating the thing down, pounding 
               it into submission. The Creature finally collapses, sliding 
               down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and 
               jerking in its own afterbirth.

               Silence now.

               A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined 
               lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a 
               dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room, 
               jerking wild shadows across the walls.

               Victor steps over the Creature. Dazed. He drops the hammer. 
               It clatters to the floor. He stops to jot a final entry:

                                     VICTOR
                         Massive birth defects. Result is 
                         malfunctional and vile.
                              (beat)
                         Have chosen to abort.

               He walks stiffly away, disappears into the bedroom...

               INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...where he staggers to the canopied bed, beyond exhausted, 
               and collapses face-down into oblivion. Weeping.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The wee hours. Rain pattering desolately on the roof. Victor 
               sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. Through a crack in 
               the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, 
               throwing a twisted spill of light. A shadow appears.

               Entering. Shambling and gliding across the floor. Silent and 
               furtive. Creeping toward the bed.

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Moving into close-up. Sleeping.

               Unaware. The shadow falls across his face. Beat. His eyes 
               fly open. An intake of breath. Paralyzed.

               Sensing the presence. Feeling the shadow. Working himself up 
               to something. Perhaps a scream. He can stand it no longer, 
               thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside...

               ...and the Creature is there, Looming like a specter of death. 
               Naked. Beseeching. Dull yellow eyes trying to understand. 
               Victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase CRASHING 
               to the floor. The Creature circles, seeking him, threatening 
               to cut off his path to the door.

                                     VICTOR
                         Stay away!

               He darts past the thing, careening out into the lab. The 
               Creature whips around, unsteady for a moment, then follows 
               him with surprising speed.

               INT - LAB - NIGHT

               Victor races through the lab with the Creature hobbling 
               behind, trying to catch up. Victor hurling lab equipment, 
               tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down.

               Victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the 
               Creature's face. The Creature presses against the wood with 
               pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone.

               He sinks to the floor. Abandoned. Shivering with cold. Sees 
               Victor's greatcoat where it fell. Grabs it. Drags it over. 
               Shrouding himself.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races into the downpour, soaked to the skin in seconds, 
               mind racing. He needs a plan. He presses on.

               INT - SHOP - NIGHT

               Victor appears at the window. TILT DOWN to reveal an array 
               of gleaming swords lying in their velvet display. Victor 
               hurls a brick through the glass. Snatches up a sword.

               INT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - NIGHT

               Victor careens in from the storm, drenched, racing up the 
               stairs, sword glittering in his grasp. He gets to the top of 
               the stairs...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               ...only to discover the door torn off it's hinges. He enters, 
               stunned. The thing is gone.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races back into the storm. Searching. Slogging grimly 
               on. Lashed by the wind and rain. Mocked by the lightning. 
               He'll never give up. Not until he finds the thing and takes 
               back the life he gave it. He dwindles from view, vanishing 
               into the gale as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT - ALLEY - MORNING

               Gray and drizzly. Heaps of wet garbage. Crawling rats. There's 
               a shifting, heaving motion. The vermin scatter as the waking 
               Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like 
               a frightened child peering from under a blanket. Lost and 
               confused.

               He scrabbles through the garbage for something to eat. He 
               finds a rotted scrap, chews it anxiously. Ravenous.

               TWO FERAL DOGS appear, grizzled denizens of the city's gutters 
               and back-alleys, peering with insolent eyes. Watching him 
               eat. Assessing his potential as a threat. The Creature stares 
               ingenuously back. Not knowing to be afraid.

               The lead dog curls his lips back with a guttural SNARL. The 
               Creature draws back sharply with a fearful MOAN. That's all 
               it takes. The dogs are on him, snarling and snapping, the 
               food torn from his hands. The dogs dart away, growling and 
               fighting over the scrap.

               The Creature is left whimpering and shaken. He pushes to his 
               feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and 
               pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar 
               against the cold. He hears a distant CLANGING.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out 
                         your deeeaaad!

               A death cart clatters slowly past the mouth of the alley, 
               DRIVER ringing his bell. It makes no sense to the Creature, 
               but it's a sign of human life. He presses on...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               ...and emerges into the square as ANGLE WIDENS. There's a 
               fair amount of activity. People are still leaving the city, 
               though the earlier flood has thinned. Some citizens are still 
               trying to go about their normal lives. VENDORS are calling 
               out, selling food. The Creature moves through the square, 
               unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. People 
               trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little 
               attention.

               The Creature pauses, sniffing the air. An aroma draws him to 
               a vendor's stand. Loaves of bread are laid out. He hunches 
               down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. Chewing.

               It's good. A bigger bite. Snatching up more.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Here! What do you think you're doing?

               The Creature glances up. The VENDOR'S WIFE is within arm's 
               reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him.

               Mouth gaping. Too stunned to scream.

               The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's 
               going to take them away. He remembers his recent experience 
               with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: 
               he curls his lips back and snarls.

               He's rewarded with a PIERCING SHRIEK. The Creature jumps 
               back, startled. This wasn't the desired effect. The woman 
               SCREAMS like she'll never stop. He turns to run away...

               ...and plows right into the stream of refugees. He goes 
               sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his 
               loaves. Confusion all around. People converge angrily. A 
               ROUGH MAN grabs his hair, jerking him upright...

                                     ROUGH MAN
                         Stupid bastard!

               ...and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, 
               whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. 
               Screams and panic. The Creature whips around, seeing horrified 
               faces on all sides...

               He's the cholera! He's the one been spreadin' the plague!

               ...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. 
               Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning 
               him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. They surround 
               him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. He tries to crawl, 
               whimpering for them to stop.

                                     VENDOR'S WIFE
                         BURN HIM! BURN HIM!

               The Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling 
               back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob 
               sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. He 
               gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, 
               scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. He's 
               wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. Men 
               start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. A 
               torch is lit, swung toward him. Feel the heat.

               The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete 
               bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, 
               bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. He 
               breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat 
               billowing. The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, 
               hurling rocks and sticks.

               EXT - STREETS/ALLEYS - DAY

               The Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many 
               cuts and bruises. He turns a corner, collapses against a 
               wall to catch his breath. He can hear them coming, shouting. 
               They'll be here any second.

               He sees a death cart heaped with bodies. He hurls himself up 
               on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses. 
               The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley. The death 
               cart WORKERS appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, 
               gaping fearfully at the confusion. They scramble into their 
               seats, snap the reins. The cart rattles off as we

               EXT - STREET - DAY

               Elsewhere in Ingolstadt. Death carts and devastation. This 
               part of town was hit hard. Bodies are heaped in gutters, 
               stacked along the walls. People are huddled in doorways, 
               quaking with sickness and pestilence. CART WORKERS move among 
               them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks.

               WORKER #1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking 
               them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy 
               burlap. He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the 
               wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever. The 
               worker's eyes widen. Stunned. He calls over his shoulder:

                                     WORKER #1
                         Over here!

               WORKER #2 hurries over. Stares down. Eyes also widening.

                                     WORKER #2
                         Oh my God.

               Worker #1 rips his mask away. It's Henry. He leans down and 
               grabs Victor, trying to rouse him.

                                     HENRY
                         Victor! 

               Worker #2 also sweeps his mask aside. Professor Krempe.

                                     KREMPE
                         Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart! 
                         Lift on three! One, two, three!

               They hoist Victor off the ground by his arms and legs and 
               carry him into the street. Victor rouses, feels himself being 
               carried. He sees a death cart looming ahead, stacked with 
               heaps of reeking dead. Staring. Waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                              (delirious, struggling)
                         No... no... I'm not dead... please... 
                         Don't put me on the cart! I'm not 
                         dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD!

               ANGLE WIDENS UP as they carry him kicking and screaming past 
               the death cart and on across the square...

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT - MASS CEMETERY - DAY

               A death cart rattles past, bearing its load. PAN WITH IT to 
               reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque. Here's where the dead 
               are brought to be burned en masse. Fires are burning. Smoke 
               is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. Soot is 
               drifting like black snow.  BODIES  are dumped into a slit- 
               trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. Barrels are kicked 
               over. Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking.

               One of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. The 
               Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of 
               oil. He knows what that means. He pushes free, clambering 
               over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, 
               loose soil crumbling under his fingertips...

               ON THE LIP OF THE TRENCH

               ...as WORKERS prepare to light the blaze. A MAN turns toward 
               the trench with a burning torch... And then the Creature 
               erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, 
               The man SCREAMS. The Creature SCREAMS even louder, cowering 
               back. The man hurls the torch. The Creature ducks as it goes 
               spinning over his head into the trench.

               WA-BOOOM! A massive wall of flame punches sky-ward. The 
               Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up 
               in horror. He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, 
               running from this ghastly place of flames and death...

               The Creature comes blundering into view. On the move. He 
               knows not where. Just away, He arrives at a pond. Water.

               He's thirsty. He scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping 
               it up with his hands. He pauses, noticing his broken 
               reflection. The water settles and his face comes clearly 
               into view. He throws his hands up and SHRIEKS, terrified at 
               his own reflection...

               ...and then he realizes it's him down there. He stirs the 
               water with his fingertips to make sure. He reaches up, 
               touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it...

               ...and utterly heartbroken. He drops his face into his hand 
               and weeps helplessly. BARKING DOGS in the distance. He looks 
               up, thinking they're after him. A moan of grief. He pushes 
               to his feet.

               TRACKING THE CREATURE  faster and faster through the trees, 
               running from this world he's been born into. Gasping for 
               breath. Crashing through branches.

               The BARKING draws closer. He hurls himself into a thicket, 
               scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves. 
               Panic. Exhaustion. Mortal terror. He flinches as something 
               comes CRASHING through the brush nearby. The legs of a DOE 
               come into view. Staggering. Falling. Thrashing down into a 
               cushion of dead leaves. Two arrows protrude from her heaving 
               side.

               A tiny FAWN stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, 
               frothing with exhaustion and terror. Waiting for his mother 
               to rise. Her thrashing grows weaker. Dying.

               The Creature moans at the sight. The fawn turns, meets his 
               gaze. An extended beat. A rush of empathy. The Creature 
               reaches out. The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. 
               The BARKING draws closer. HUNTERS shouting. The Creature's 
               fingertips make contact with the fawn...

               A pack of the biggest, nastiest Staffordshire terriers you've 
               ever seen throw themselves HOWLING AND SNARLING onto the 
               doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, The Creature lets 
               out a SHRIEK, snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, 
               crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his 
               chest. The dogs take off after him.

               DOLLYING THE CREATURE

               Running full-tilt, SHRIEKING in terror all the way. Trying 
               to save the fawn. Trying to save himself. The dogs are 
               snapping at his heels, trying to sever his hamstrings and 
               bring him down. He hears RUSHING WATER ahead, crashes headlong 
               through a thicket...

               EXT - RIVER - DAY

               ...and sails SCREAMING into empty SPACE, twisting and spinning 
               as he falls, plummeting head-first into the rapids. The dogs 
               are left behind. The Creature gets swept along, gasping and 
               choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched 
               protectively to his chest.

               Finally the water starts to settle. He manages to lash out 
               and secure a handhold. He pulls himself up, clambering over 
               the rocks and staggering onto firm soil. He collapses to his 
               knees, dripping water and heaving for breath. He lowers the 
               fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape... only to 
               realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands. 
               He crushed it to death trying to save it. He lays it down, 
               moaning, trying to understand. ANGLE WIDENS UP into the trees 
               as we

               WOODS - DUSK

               TILT DOWN to reveal a solitary figure in a greatcoat trudging 
               across the sodden countryside under a dismal, darkening sky. 
               Cold. Hungry. Wet. Tired.

               The Creature pauses, hearing FAINT MUSIC drifting on the 
               breeze: the lovely flute-like sounds of a recorder. He slogs 
               to the crest of a ridge. There's a small house in the valley 
               below. A peasant dwelling. Smoke drifts from the chimney. 
               That's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive 
               rendition of our movie's WALTZ/LOVE THEME).

               The Creature proceeds down the ridge... drawn by the music 
               and the promise of warmth.

               HOUSE - DAY

               The Creature approaches cautiously. Furtive. He eases to a 
               window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back. Listening. The 
               tune ends. We hear the pleasant murmur of VOICES. FOOTSTEPS 
               come clumping across the floor. The Creature reels back and 
               dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and 
               swings open. FELIX exits, a poor man trying to scratch an 
               honest living from the soil. He heads in the same direction 
               as the Creature...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               ...and walks around the corner of the house just as the 
               Creature scrambles from view behind the chicken coops. The 
               Creature watches through the wire and wood as Felix approaches 
               and stops, only his legs visible. Feed is scattered through 
               the wire. The chickens begins to eat. The Creature backs up

               PIGSTY - DUSK

               ...and finds himself in the company of PIGS. The animals 
               GRUNT and SQUEAL in alarm.

                                     FELIX (O.S.)
                         Yes, yes, I'm coming...

               The Creature scurries further back into the shadows as Felix's 
               feet stop just outside. A pail is upended. Slop pours into 
               the trough. Felix walks away. The pigs scurry to eat. The 
               Creature leans forward intently. Food?

               He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. They 
               jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. 
               He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his 
               chin. Not much on taste, but it's edible.

               He stops, hearing the recorder MUSIC again, turning toward 
               the sound. He follows it, crawling back into the darkest 
               recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house. He 
               places his eye to a chink between the logs...

               ...and sees GRANDFATHER playing the instrument near a 
               fireplace of glowing embers. The Creature shifts for another 
               view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner. Felix 
               and his wife MARIE are helped by their children, MAGGIE AND 
               THOMAS, ages 6 and 8

                                     MARIE
                         Bring Grandfather to the table.

               The old man stops playing as the children scurry over. As 
               Maggie helps him to his feet, Thomas tosses another log on 
               the fire. It BLAZES UP. Fire and sparks. In the pigsty, the 
               Creature draws back with a fearful moan...

               ...that nobody but GRANDFATHER hears, He pauses to gaze 
               blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering 
               what it might have been. Probably nothing. He lets the 
               children lead him toward the table. The meal is brought from 
               the stove and ladled out.

               The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling 
               it from here. A string of drool spills from his mouth. It's 
               humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast 
               compared to pig slop...

               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Victor lies sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. In an 
               eerie echo of before: the door creaks open in a spill of 
               light. A shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his 
               face. Victor's eyes fly open. He tries to erupt from bed, 
               choking on a scream... and Henry wrestles him back to the 
               pillow to feel his clammy forehead.

                         I've been worried we might lose you. 
                         It's been touch-and-go for a week.

                         We feared cholera. Turned out to be 
                         pneumonia, brought on by nervous 
                         exhaustion and some idiot running 
                         around in a storm.

                         out working with the cholera victims. 
                         It's his turn for that just now.

                                     VICTOR
                         You've been going round-the-clock?

                         We catch a few hours sleep where we

                         Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.

               Victor takes Henry's hand. Squeezes it.

                         It's the down-and-outs I pity most.

                         They'll be dead by the thousands 
                         before this is done. They don't stand 
                         a chance out there.

                         No. They don't.

                         Victor. This place looked like a 
                         charnel house. What went on here?

               Victor pauses, too emotional to respond. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I want to go home.

               Beat.

               Henry accepts this, though he doesn't like it.

                                     HENRY
                         It'll be months before you're well 
                         enough. Meantime, your family must 
                         be frantic not hearing from you.

               Henry grabs a stack of letters from the nightstand.

                                     HENRY
                         I found these. Some of the postmarks 
                         go back nine months.
                              (slaps them on the 
                              bed)
                         Why don't you open them? And when 
                         you've the strength, have the decency 
                         to ease their minds with a reply. 
                         Soon as the city ends quarantine, 
                         I'll even mail it for you. Along 
                         with this.
                              (raises the locket)
                         It's a beautiful gift. Does her no 
                         good lying here.

               Henry leaves him alone to wrestle with his guilt. Victor is 
               swept with emotion and remorse. He closes his eyes. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It can't survive.

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               The Creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap. He rouses, 
               scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty. Felix is 
               returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his 
               back. The Creature moves to his chink in the wall to see 
               Felix enter the house and dump the basket out for Marie. A 
               pathetic array of potatoes and turnips.

                                     FELIX
                         Not much to look at. Even less to 
                         eat. I don't how we're going to get 
                         through the winter with this yield.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll sell another pig at market.

                                     FELIX
                         One less for us.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll make do. We always have.

               He sinks into a chair, weighed by worry. She moves to comfort 
               him, cradling his head to her breast. He returns her embrace, 
               drawing strength. A tender, gentle moment. The Creature 
               watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy. 
               Felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes.

                                     FELIX
                         I'll see if I can scratch a few more 
                         out of the ground.

               He hoists the basket and exits. The Creature turns to watch 
               Felix trudging back toward the fields.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               Felix digs for potatoes, tilling as he goes. Back-breaking 
               work. Thomas provides what help he can. Some distance away, 
               Maggie and Grandfather are tending the cow. ANGLE SHIFTS to 
               reveal the Creature watching from the brambles...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family eat their dinner. Potatoes 
               and turnips. A glimmer of understanding in his eyes.

               EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

               A long shadow looms toward the dwelling... circling the 
               house... approaching the shed. Baskets and tools...

               EXT - FIELDS - NIGHT

               We find the Creature working by the light of a refulgent 
               moon, hacking away at the soil, tilling the earth...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAWN

               The Creature stirs, hearing movement within the house. He 
               scurries to the slats of the sty and peers out. All the 
               baskets from the tool shed are stacked to overflow before 
               the door.

               The door opens. Felix steps out and trips on a basket, 
               sprawling to the ground in a torrent of potatoes and turnips. 
               He sits up, gazing in wonder.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               A sliver of warm light spills through the chink in the wall.

               The Creature looms into frame, busily munching a raw potato.

               A pig comes snuffling at his elbow. He shoves him away. Go 
               find your own. Inside, the family is enjoying a much more 
               generous meal than the last one:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I wish we could thank our benefactor.

                                     FELIX
                         Nothing in this life comes free of 
                         cost. I'd like to know who and why.

                                     MAGGIE
                         It's the Good Spirit of the forest.

                                     FELIX
                         Who's been filling your head?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         It does no harm.

                                     FELIX
                              (peers at him)
                         Oh, I see.

                                     THOMAS
                         Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?

               Felix and Marie exchange a look. He's not as amused as she 
               is, but lets it go. She smiles at the children.

                                     MARIE
                         Of course it is. Now finish your 
                         food before it gets cold.

               EXT - POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. The cow is grazing at 
               a distance. The Creature creeps into view, listening to the 
               music. Grandfather senses his presence. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Who's there? Felix? Children?

               No response. He turns back. Unsettled. Continues playing.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches Marie instructing the children in their 
               letters. A half dozen words are written in chalk on a slate 
               board. Maggie is trying to puzzle one out:

                                     MAGGIE
                         ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.

                                     MARIE
                         Good! And now the next

                                     CREATURE
                              (mimicking the effort)
                         ...freh...nnn..nd. Freehhnnnd.

               He's delighted to have uttered his first word.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               Felix is chopping lengths of wood, dulled by the task. The 
               children are stacking the wood on a litter.

               EXT - FIELD - DUSK

               Felix and the children walk home. The litter of wood is being 
               dragged by their cow...

               EXT - HOUSE - DUSK

               Felix stacks the last pile of wood under the eaves. Marie 
               meets him at the door, takes his hands.

                                     MARIE
                         Your hands are bleeding again. Come 
                         in. I'll rub liniment.

               They go inside. The door closes. CAMERA PUSHES to the pigsty. 
               Eyes peering out.

               EXT - WOODS - NIGHT

               The Creature walks along, munching a turnip, axe slung over 
               his shoulder, muttering:

                                     CREATURE
                         .brread... motherrr... frriend...
                              (stops, gazes up)
                         Treeeeee. 

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The walls around the house are stacked impossibly high with 
               cords of wood. Felix and Marie gaze out the door. Stunned.

                                     FELIX
                         What is going on here?

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Snow is drifting outside the tall dormer window. We find 
               Victor at his desk, reading a letter:

                                     VICTOR
                         "...but it's been so long since I've 
                         heard from you. Remember the vow we 
                         took the night you left? You must be 
                         honest with me if your feelings have 
                         changed. Answer for the sake of our 
                         friendship, and both our future 
                         happiness."
                              (pause)
                         She wrote that four months ago.

               ANGLE SHIFTS to include Henry. He's been listening.

                                     HENRY
                         A woman like that is far too rare to 
                         be taken lightly.

               Victor ponders the letter. He lays it next to the locket, 
               pulls out a sheet of paper and quill, begins to write...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature observes another lesson. Six more words are 
               chalked on the board. Thomas is struggling with the first:

                                     THOMAS
                         Ch...uur-ch. Church.

                                     CREATURE
                         Ch...uuu...ch.

                                     MARIE
                         Good. And the next.

                                     THOMAS
                         Fl...oww.

                                     CREATURE
                         Floww...

               And then, amazingly, the Creature finishes the word before 
               Thomas does:

                                     CREATURE
                         ...wwer. Flower.

                                     THOMAS
                         ...wer. Flower?

                                     MARIE
                         Very good! Maggie. Try the next.

               Now the Creature beats Maggie to the punch:

                                     CREATURE
                         Garrr...denn. Garden.

                                     THOMAS
                         Maria! Look! It's snowing!

               The children crowd to the window. The Creature turns, peering 
               through the slats. White flakes drift magically down. The 
               door flies open, the children pour out. The adults appear in 
               the doorway:

                                     MARIE
                         Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your 
                         death!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Let them play. There's plenty of 
                         wood for the fire.

                                     FELIX
                              (shoots her a look)
                         He's right about that.

               Before she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags 
               her shrieking out into the snow. Before you know it, a wild 
               snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter.

               THE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having 
               the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. 
               Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         It's snnowwinng.

               EXT - HOUSE - DAY

               Bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. Felix 
               and the children are heading out, spirits high. Felix has 
               his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               TRACKING Felix and the children. They're laughing and joking, 
               the kids playful and giggling. The Creature shadows them, 
               looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. 
               Happy as a kid himself.

               Maggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing 
               their arms and legs in the snow. They jump to their feet and 
               hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed 
               to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, 
               Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree.

                                     MAGGIE
                         That one! It's the most beautiful 
                         tree I've ever seen!

               Felix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit 
               up with wonder. Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of 
               ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and 
               laughter. Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire

                                     CREATURE
                         Most beautiful... tree...

               The kids go dashing across the room. The Creature shifts to 
               the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light.

               The children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out 
               into the darkness:

                                     MAGGIE
                         Merry Christmas!

               The door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries 
               closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with 
               a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board 
               is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering 
               of a glowing angel and a message:

                                     CREATURE
                         For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of 
                         the... Forr-rest.

               He snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the 
               house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize.

               He plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it 
               gingerly into an inner coat pocket. He uncovers the plate to 
               reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies.

               He's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad.

               He picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes 
               going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts 
               huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. 
               Screw potatoes and turnips.

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The children race out the door to find the plate empty. And 
               a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard,

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family clustered around the fire. 
               Marie reads a book aloud:

                                     MARIE
                         ...with particles of heavenly fire, 
                         the God of Nature did his soul 
                         inspire... and pliant still the 
                         ethereal energy which wise Prometheus 
                         tempered into paste...

               The Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the 
               concept of book. He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, 
               and pulls out what's been there all along:

               Victor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds 
               the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from 
               the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head 
               this way and that. Slowly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Myyy Darrllnng Vic...tor... Willee

               EXT - GRANDFATHER'S POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. Again, the Creature 
               approaches to listen. Grandfather stops. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I know you're there.
                              (waits for a response)
                         Won't you speak to me?

               The Creature studies Grandfather for a time. The old man 
               waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a 
               spot to listen. He opens Victor's journal.

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN as he puzzles over it...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               ...and we CONTINUE PUSHING SLOWLY IN as the Creature reads:

                                     CREATURE
                         ...of sscience... and to c-create... 
                         a beinng... in the image of man...

                         bodieess I have... gatherrred...

               He turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness: it's 
               Victor's sketch of his patchwork man. The rendering includes 
               suture marks where the pieces were joined.

               The Creature gazes for a long time. His finger traces the 
               penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso. Eyes going 
               wider. Revelation slowly dawning. No. It can't be. it's too 
               horrible to conceive...

               ...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge 
               of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm... And the 
               massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an 
               exact match to the drawing. He throws his head back in an 
               animalistic PRIMAL SCREAM, face twisted in a mask of utter 
               horror, Munch's painting made flesh...

               IN THE WOODS

               ...and his scream echoes across the countryside, Felix turns 
               from chopping wood. His family gathers, eyes wide, listening 
               to the sound trail off. Softly:

                                     FELIX
                         God in heaven.

               IN THE PIGSTY

               A massive hand rips the page from the journal, raises it in 
               a clenched fist.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature huddled in a corner, 
               dropping his head into his arms to hide his face. Sunlight 
               throws streaks of light and shadow through the slats. He 
               sobs, wracked with despair as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT - VALLEY - DAY

               The house is distant below. Felix and his family are heading 
               out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow 
               before them. Only Grandfather is missing.

               The gentle MUSIC of the recorder drifts up from the house.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature hunkered on a hill. 
               Watching. Waiting. The family dwindles in the distance.

               INT - HOUSE - DAY

               For the first time, we actually see the inside of the house 
               from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall.

               Grandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder.

               The Creature's face appears at a window. Peering in. He ducks 
               from view, appearing at another window. Making sure the house 
               is otherwise empty. He vanishes again. The door swings 
               silently open. His figure fills the doorway.

               Grandfather stops playing. Silence.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Would you like to sit by the fire?

               The Creature enters. Sits. Holds his hands toward the embers, 
               feeling the warmth.

                                     CREATURE
                         Nice.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         The music? Or the fire?

               Grandfather offers him the recorder. The Creature hesitates, 
               takes it, inept where such delicacy is required. He puts it 
               to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones. He gives 
               it back, huffing air, delighted.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I'm glad you finally came to the 
                         door. A man shouldn't have to scurry 
                         in the shadows.

                                     CREATURE
                         Better that way... for me.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why?

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm... very, very ugly. People are 
                         afraid. Except you.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (smiles)
                         It can't be as bad as that.

                                     CREATURE
                              (soft)
                         Worse.

               The old man-reaches for his face. The Creature draws back.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I can see you with my hands. If you'll 
                         trust me.

               The Creature decides to trust. He eases forward. Grandfather 
               runs his fingers over his features. Gently:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         You're an outcast.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. I have been seeking my friends.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Friends? Do they live around here?

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. Very close

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why do you not go to them?

               The Creature pauses. Emotions swirling. Afraid to continue.

                                     CREATURE
                         I have been... afraid. Afraid... 
                         they will hate me... because I am so 
                         very ugly... and they are so very 
                         beautiful

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (softly)
                         People can be kinder than you think.

                                     CREATURE
                         I am afraid.

               Grandfather reaches out and takes the Creature's hands.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Perhaps I can help. Tell me who.

               The Creature is huffing air, breath hitching in his chest 
               like a panicking child. His monstrous eyes well up with tears. 
               Trying to get the words out:

                                     CREATURE
                         I love them... so very much. I want... 
                         I want... them to be my ff-family. I 
                         II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm-
                         mmuch...

               The Creature pauses. Trying to get the words out. And the 
               door swings open. The Creature whips his head. There stands 
               Maggie. Eyes going wide. Breath catching in her throat. She 
               lets out an ear-splitting SHRIEK! The Creature throws himself 
               on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't let them hate me!

               Felix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose 
               in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the 
               children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the 
               Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling 
               to the floor, the old man shouting, the children SHRIEKING, 
               Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, 
               again and again, trying to kill the thing...

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Leave him alone!

               ...the CREATURE SCREAMING and taking the blows, writhing 
               across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his 
               pleading hands. The CREATURE rolls from under the brutal 
               beating and sails out the door.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               The Creature runs bleeding and sobbing, a specter sailing 
               among the trees with greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings. 
               Running from the horrified screams of rejection still echoing 
               in his mind.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               A snowscape. Stark trees. A figure in a greatcoat. Head bowed 
               with misery. Leaning against a tree. Trying to catch his 
               breath. Can't. Crying too hard. He sinks to his knees, hands 
               clutched bitterly to his heaving chest. Wondering why the 
               anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat.

               A realization. He pulls the little red silk flower from the 
               inside pocket. It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen 
               palm like gentle magic. Or hope. Yes.

               HOUSE - DUSK

               The sky is brewing. The Creature runs across the courtyard 
               toward the house, breathless, holding his palm out. See? 
               Here's the flower you gave me. Don't you understand?

                                     CREATURE
                         It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee!

               Nothing. He glances around. The pigs are gone. Chickens too.

               The Creature's eyes go wide. He dashes to the house

               HOUSE - DUSK

               ...and bursts in to find it empty. Items have been scattered 
               and left behind. Books, clothes, even the old man's recorder. 
               They left in a hurry.

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no.

               HOUSE - NIGHT

               We hear furniture CRASHING, glass SHATTERING, shelves being 
               ripped from walls. A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. 
               The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. 
               He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a 
               satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's 
               recorder jammed in his belt.

               A HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning 
               the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along 
               with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting 
               as the house is consumed...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               Massive pale gray feet walking through the snow. ANGLE 
               WIDENING to reveal a lone, windswept figure traversing the 
               glacier with a walking staff. Struggling toward the crest of 
               a ridge. Greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind.

               THE CREATURE rises from below the crest and gazes down.

               Glowering with triumph at achieving his goal. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Geneva.

               AERIAL SHOT sweeps up the slope of the glacier like the wind 
               itself, rising magnificently past the tiny figure standing 
               on the ridge, sailing up over the crest... to reveal the 
               valley and lake of Geneva below.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY (SPRING)

               Sunlight streams through the dormer window. Birds twitter on 
               the ledge outside. The trees are in bloom. Victor stands 
               dressed and ready to go, taking one last pensive look around 
               at the now-empty garret. Henry appears:

                                     HENRY
                         Our carriage is here.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT CITY GATES - DAY

               Bustling with activity. Hopeful. A traffic snarl is jammed 
               up in both directions, waiting to get in and out of the city. 
               People, carriages, wagons, goods. We find Professor and MRS. 
               KREMPE saying goodbye to Victor and Henry:

                                     MRS. KREMPE
                              (watching the gates)
                         Such a terrible winter. I'll praise 
                         God to see those gates open again.

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll have all your things sent on. 
                         They should arrive soon after.
                              (Victor nods)
                         It's been a rough time, lad. For us 
                         all. But if you'd like to come back 
                         and finish out your final term once 
                         university re-opens...

               A ROAR goes up from the crowd. The gates are finally opening 
               as SOLDIERS swing them aside. The traffic starts to flow.

               Victor turns back to Krempe, nods gratefully.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Professor. For everything.

               Krempe is flustered as Victor gives him an awkward hug.

                                     KREMPE
                         Write and let us know you've arrived 
                         safely.

               Victor breaks the embrace. He and Henry clamber into the 
               carriage. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Take me home, my friend.

               Henry signals the DRIVER. The reins snap. The carriage lurches 
               away, easing into the flow of traffic as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               William, now 10, comes charging up the steps with a small 
               package under his arm, nearly bowling over Mrs. Moritz as he 
               sails past her hollering his head off:

                                     WILLIAM
                         HE'S COMING HOME!

               INT - PARLOR - DAY

               Willie careens into the parlor, where Elizabeth and Justine 
               are entertaining FRIENDS.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth! Justine!

               Father enters, trailed by HOUSEHOLD STAFF.

                                     FATHER
                         What's all the fuss? Why are you 
                         shouting?

                                     WILLIAM
                         He's coming home! Tonight!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Who? Victor?

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's what I'm telling you!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (swept with relief)
                         Thank God.

               Willie thrusts the package into her hands. She hesitates

                                     FATHER
                         Open it.

               Willie scrambles to bring her the letter opener. Elizabeth 
               lays the package down, slits it open. Willie peers in.

               Elizabeth pulls the locket out to the admiration of all. She 
               presses the catch. The locket pops open to reveal Waldman's 
               miniature oil painting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's Victor!

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's beautiful! May I?
                              (takes the locket)
                         He looks so handsome.

               Elizabeth pulls out the letter. Apprehension and hope. She 
               begins to read. The others watch her. Waiting. Her face lights 
               up, blinking back tears. She remembers to breathe.

                                     FATHER
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let this locket be a token of the 
                         vow we took the night I left.
                              (beat)
                         He's coming home to marry me.

               Instant pandemonium and joy... except from Justine, whose 
               heart quietly breaks. Father and the others ROAR with approval 
               while Willie jumps and shouts:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Married! The two of you?

                                     FATHER
                         Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you 
                         were children!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (softly)
                         That's wonderful.

               She hands the locket back. She slips quietly from the room, 
               unnoticed by the others...

               INT - ENTRYWAY - DAY

               and hurries down the hall, fighting back tears.

               RESUME PARLOR as Elizabeth is swept up in congratulatory 
               conversation. Willie grabs the locket, admiring it:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth? Can I take this to show 
                         Peter?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Willie, it's not a toy for your 
                         friends.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'll take extra special care, I 
                         promise! Pete's never seen what Victor 
                         looks like! He'll admire it 
                         enormously!

               Willie's so solemn and earnest that Elizabeth has to smile.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few 
                         hours.

               The boy takes off like a shot. Father throws his arm around

               Elizabeth, announcing to all:

                                     FATHER
                         Join us for champagne! My son is 
                         coming home!

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               Geese scatter as Willie comes racing across the grounds. He 
               clambers over a low fence, heading into the miles of wooded 
               acreage behind the house. His favorite shortcut.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - LATE DAY

               Willie hurries/dawdles along as kids do, the precious locket 
               clutched in his hands, admiring it. He can't get over the 
               fact that his brother's finally coming home.

               He pauses, hearing FAINT TONES carried on the breeze, eerie 
               and flute-like. A recorder. Curious, he follows the sounds 
               further and further into the woods...

               EXT - POND - LATE DAY

               ...and comes into view of the pond. There's a FIGURE sitting 
               half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the 
               water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly-
               pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME.)

               Willie draws closer. Curious. Not wanting to intrude, but 
               listening to the music. The figure in the reeds still hasn't 
               noticed him...

               ...And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right 
               out of a storybook. Willie's eyes go wide. The locket drops 
               from his fingers into the dust. The boy turns and runs as 
               the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet:

                                     CREATURE
                         Wait! Don't be afraid!

               The boy keeps running. The Creature comes shambling up from 
               the pond, still calling after him. He picks up the dropped 
               object. As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket.

               At the small painting it contains. Victor Frankenstein. He 
               raises his gaze after the fleeing boy. Maybe Willie does 
               have reason to be afraid.

               The Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, 
               teeth grinding in greater and greater rage. Eyes wild.

               THEIR FEET go pounding through the brambles and brush. The 
               terrified boy. The pursuing monster. Faster and faster...

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN KITCHEN - DUSK

               Whirling with activity. Mrs. Moritz supervises the staff.

               Elizabeth and Justine are helping with the preparations.

               Justine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen 
               staff. Carrots go flying.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine! Pay attention!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (tight)
                         Yes, Mother.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (pulls her aside)
                         Are you all right?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (even tighter)
                         Fine.

               Justine sees genuine concern. She softens:

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'll be all right. Really.

               Father enters with Claude. Both men worried.

                                     FATHER
                         Have you seen Willie?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is he not back yet?

                                     FATHER
                         Claude rode over there to see if 
                         held lost track of time. They say he 
                         never arrived.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's far too late for him to still 
                         be out.

               EXT - MANSION - DUSK

               Elizabeth exits with the others

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find 
                         him.

               He rushes to gather the men. Elizabeth gazes off. Wind kicking 
               up. Night approaching. Almost too dark to see.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE/WOODS - NIGHT

               A massive search in progress. People are scouring the fields 
               on horse and on foot, shouting Willie's name. Elizabeth enters 
               frame, calling out:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         WILLIE!

               LIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching.

               EXT - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

               The stark black silhouettes of tree trunks bisect the frame 
               in foreground as Justine approaches from the fields, lantern 
               held high...

                                     JUSTINE
                         WILLIE!

               ...and one of the "tree trunks" turns out not to be. It darts 
               abruptly across frame with a billow of flapping greatcoat, 
               Justine enters the woods. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING sends shadows 
               skittering among the trees...

               EXT - ROAD TO MANSION - NIGHT

               ...And the storm is now a raging downpour, TILT DOWN to reveal 
               a coach clattering through the rain.

               INT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor is peering out the window flap.

                                     VICTOR
                         There! Look!

               Henry cranes to look. A LIGHTNING FLASH stutters the mansion 
               briefly to life a few hundred yards down the road,

                                     HENRY
                         Quite a place.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         For what?

                                     VICTOR
                         This. My home. My family.
                              (softly)
                         If not for you, I'd be dead in a 
                         burial pit somewhere.

               Henry smiles, squeezes his shoulder. The carriage lurches 
               violently, tossing them forward.

               EXT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor jumps from the coach as the DRIVER wrestles his rearing 
               horses under control and points. Victor turns.

               Elizabeth stands in the downpour like a ghost. Drenched to 
               the bone. Weeping from the depths of her soul. Holding Willie 
               in her arms. The boy's arms hang limp, his head dangles back. 
               Victor starts forward, stunned, unable to comprehend, running 
               faster and faster...

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth?

               ...and now others are converging on the scene, dark screaming 
               figures in the storm. Victor reaches her first as the others 
               crowd around in a panic of confusion, crushing and jostling 
               as she collapses into Victor's arms, all of them cradling 
               Willie, and then Father is there, shoving his way through, -- 
               seeing his dead boy and collapsing in the muck with a SCREAM, 
               and suddenly Henry is there shouting for the men to lift him 
               and everybody is scrambling and screaming as we

               INT - MANSION - FATHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Silence. All we hear now is the SOFT TICKING of a clock.

               Henry tenderly ministers to Father, who lies gravely ill.

               INT - PARLOR - MORNING

               Elizabeth is sitting. Elbows crossed. Holding herself 
               together. Face ashen. Dazed. Still in shock. Mrs. Moritz is 
               nearby, looking much the same. Eyes swimming with tears.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         We'll organize another search now 
                         that it's light enough. We'll find 
                         her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.

               Henry comes downstairs. He and Victor confer in whispers 
               then approach Elizabeth. Victor crouches before her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What is Father's outlook?

                                     HENRY
                         I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet 
                         and proper care he may eventually 
                         regain some or most of his strength.

               Victor squeezes her hand. Comfort and strength.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Thank you, Henry.

               There's a KNOCKING at the front door.

               INT - ENTRYWAY - MORNING

               Victor opens the door. POLICEMEN hover outside. Faces grim.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended 
                         the murderer. Not five miles from 
                         here, hiding in a barn.

                                     VICTOR
                         Who is it?

               The policemen trade uneasy glances.

                         It's very unsettling, sir. And quite 
                         strange. Perhaps you'd better come 
                         with us.

               INT - JAIL CELL - DAY

               Victor is led in by policemen. The JAILER unlocks the cell.

               Victor enters as the men depart. Victor is alone, staring at 
               a FIGURE huddled in the corner, pooled in shadow. We get the 
               impression of long, dangling hair. The figure stirs...

                                     FEMALE VOICE
                         Victor?

               ...and leans into the light. Justine. Pale. Dazed. Scared

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor! It's you! Thank God!

               She rushes to him, throws herself into his arms. He reacts 
               stiffly, not at all sure he wants her touching him.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Is it true? What they say about 
                         Willie? Is it true?

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes.

               She dissolves into tears. Barely able to breathe.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Willie. My poor little angel.
                              (looks up)
                         Victor! They think I did it!

                                     VICTOR
                         Did you?

               Justine pauses. Stunned. Her eyes on his. Here's the deepest 
               betrayal ever experienced. Her heart turns to ash.

                                     JUSTINE
                              (low)
                         I don't believe... I am in need of 
                         your comfort... anymore.

                                     VICTOR
                              (a whisper)
                         Did you, Justine?

               Beat. She hauls off and slaps him hard enough to rock his 
               head around. Then she slaps him again. Harder.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Get out!

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               The courtroom is packed. Justine sits accused. An older 
               KITCHEN MAID is on the stand.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         I found her sobbing her eyes out. 
                         Poor thing, I said, what's all this? 
                         And she spilled her heart to me about 
                         Master Victor. How she'd always loved 
                         him, and now he was coming home to 
                         marry mistress Elizabeth.

               A MURMUR sweeps the courtroom. Victor and Elizabeth share a 
               stunned glance.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         She cried and cried about the 
                         beautiful locket he'd sent. How she 
                         wished it was hers. She swore me 
                         never to tell a soul.
                              (peers at Justine)
                         That was before the boy went missing, 
                         a'course.

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               Victor is on the stand:

                                     VICTOR
                         I always viewed her with brotherly 
                         affection. I had no idea of her 
                         feelings for me.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Rejection can be a powerful wound. 
                         People have been known to do uncanny 
                         things.

                                     VICTOR
                         But to commit so ghastly and terrible 
                         a crime against a child she loved?

               Victor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition. He looks to 
               Justine. She gazes back, her feelings hidden. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's hard to believe.

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               Elizabeth is on the stand:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Justine and I grew up as sisters. I 
                         know her better than anybody.

                                     DEFENDING COUNSEL
                         Do you think it possible she committed 
                         this crime?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         William was as much her child as 
                         mine. We were both mother to him.
                              (beat)
                         I believe she would sooner have 
                         strangled the life from her own body.

                                     DEFENDING COUNSEL
                         Then you consider the charge without 
                         merit.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I consider the charge imbecilic.

               INT - COURT ROOM - DAY

               Justine is now on the stand:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes. I took refuge in the barn. 
                         Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? 
                         Freezing and wet? I was exhausted 
                         and could search no longer.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         And is it true, Miss Moritz, that 
                         you love Victor Frankenstein? That 
                         your heart was broken?
                              (off her silence)
                         Answer the question. Do you love 
                         Victor Frankenstein?

               Her gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his. Stares back, 
               trapped.

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have always loved him.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Is it also not true that you murdered 
                         his brother William in a misdirected 
                         crime of passion?

                         Murder Willie? In my heart, he was 
                         our child. Victor's and mine. Such a 
                         thing could never have entered my 
                         mind.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         So you have claimed. Yet you have no 
                         explanation for this.
                              (holds up the locket)
                         The locket last seen in the hands of 
                         the poor murdered child was found 
                         hidden in your dress the morning 
                         following the murder. The locket you 
                         so coveted.
                              (leans close)
                         How did it come to be in your 
                         possession?

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have no knowledge of that.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               A PAIR OF FEET drop heavily in frame. THUMP-CRACK! A shoe 
               flies off. The CROWD gasps. Mrs. Moritz collapses WAILING to 
               the ground. Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. Victor 
               just stands staring. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Justine dangling 
               from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still 
               twitching.

               EXT - SAME FIELD - NIGHT

               Another eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. The body 
               dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. Victor 
               looms from the darkness, staring.

               And then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs 
               his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up 
               into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous 
               necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. 
               He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, 
               draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to-
               eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Frankenstein.

               Victor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his 
               arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look 
               there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating 
               Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then 
               the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness.  
               Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, 
               gazing at the scaffold, horrified.

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!

               Screaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms 
               around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking 
               to his knees, weeping helplessly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.

               INT - MANSION - STUDY - DAWN

               Victor pulls a carved box from a shelf. Opens it. Lying inside 
               in their velvet cradle are a gorgeous pair of Model 1820 
               Collier flintlock revolvers.

               MANSION - DAWN

               Victor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on 
               a horse held by Claude. Elizabeth is at his heels.

                                     VICTOR
                         My mind was not playing tricks. He 
                         was there in the storm... gloating 
                         over his crimes... challenging me to 
                         come.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         But why risk yourself? Hasn't this 
                         family suffered enough?

                                     VICTOR
                         I've no choice

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If what you say is true, it is a 
                         matter for the police!

                                     VICTOR
                         They've done a fine job. Hanging an 
                         innocent for the crime of a fiend.

               He rams the rifle into its scabbard, turns to her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (softly)
                         Do you know this man? Is there 
                         something between you?

                                     VICTOR
                         I know only that he is a killer.  
                         And I shall bring back his carcass.

               Victor heaves himself into the saddle and rides off. TILT UP 
               to the mountain. Shrouded in snow. Waiting.

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               A lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge...

               Victor ascends the mountain. The mountain is brutal and 
               unforgiving. Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the 
               glacier. A bitter wind blows...

               They plod on. Searching. Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding 
               before our eyes. Primeval and vast...

               The horse suddenly spooks. Victor calms him. Staring. Is 
               that a figure down there? He shades his eyes against the 
               cutting sleet. Somebody in the distance. Down there on the 
               snow field. A tiny speck. Watching him.

               The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great 
               bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box 
               from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the 
               snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair 
               of revolvers.

               He glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of 
               white. Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the 
               flintlocks of both, turning slowly around. Gazing at the 
               rocks and crags. Searching.

                                     VICTOR
                         WHERE ARE YOU?

               He hears nothing but his own voice echoing back... and then 
               FEET CRUNCHING through the snow. He turns. The Creature is 
               running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, 
               greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings.

               Victor raises the first pistol. Hesitates. As frightened and 
               angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the 
               achievement of actually having created life.

               He pulls the trigger. BOOM! A huge flash of powder, an 
               eruption of smoke. The Creature dodges the shot, still coming. 
               Victor raises the other gun. BOOM! Another flash of smoke. 
               Still the Creature comes.

               Victor. Frantic. Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, 
               firing. BOOM! A miss. BOOM! Another miss. Spinning. cocking.

               Firing. BOOM! BOOM! Spinning. Cocking...

               ...And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean 
               out of his hands. The guns sail through the air, spinning 
               off across the ice. Victor panics, turns to run... And slips 
               over the edge of the precipice.

               Victor falls SCREAMING, arms and legs windmilling through a 
               30-foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. He looks 
               up. The Creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge 
               to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a 
               cat-like crouch. He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him 
               sliding across the ice with a mighty heave...

               INT - ICE CAVE - DAY

               ...right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling 
               and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to

               Winded. Battered. Barely able to move. He glances up to see 
               the cave filled with possessions. Books. Provisions. Extra 
               clothing. The embers of a fire burn low. There is even a 
               rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates.

               A huge shadow fills the cave entrance. The storybook ogre is 
               coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. 
               Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as

               ...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers 
               down. He tosses a few more sticks on the flames. Pause.

               Tears welling. Overcome with shame and horror.

               He falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail

               EXT - GARDEN - DAY

               ...and we find them in discussion by the fountain:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What sort of task?

                                     VICTOR
                         It's not something I can explain 
                         now. Perhaps someday.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What of our marriage? Victor, we've 
                         had so much tragedy. I want this 
                         family to live again.

                                     VICTOR
                         So do I.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         We need each other now, I need your 
                         comfort and strength, not separation 
                         and solitude.

                                     VICTOR
                         A month at most, that's all I ask.
                              (draws close)
                         Elizabeth, please. Things have not 
                         yet resolved. I must take steps to 
                         see that they do. For our family's 
                         sake. For our sake.
                              (caresses her face)
                         You are life itself. We shall seal 
                         our vow. The moment I am done.

               He leans forward to kiss her... and pauses, hearing the 
               distant MUSIC of a recorder echoing from the hills...

               INT - BEDROOM - DAY

               Victor sits at bedside, holding Father's hand. The old man 
               is a weak and frail shadow of his former self.

                                     VICTOR
                         You must regain your strength to 
                         preside at our wedding... and spoil 
                         your grandchildren later on. These 
                         are duties you cannot shirk.

               Father smiles faintly.

               Victor squeezes his hand, whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         We're all safe now. I promise

               INT - MANSION ATTIC - DAY

               Murky and dark. Victor enters, yanks a dusty curtain off a 
               window to let in some daylight. He picks up a pry bar, 
               approaches a stack of crates as if facing an old adversary. 
               One in particular is quite large. He rams the bar into the 
               wood, prying it open... and CAMERA PUSHES IN to reveal a 
               dull gleam of copper lurking within the packing straw.

                                     VICTOR
                         God forgive me.

               MONTAGE:

               Victor assembles his equipment, recreating the lab; bolting 
               together the sarcophagus, now resting in its cradle. Hanging 
               the huge glass tube, adjusting the boom. Installing the 
               ceiling tracks and hoist mechanism. Playing out the copper 
               wire along the ceiling beams. Hooking up the galvanic 
               batteries and generators. Testing the electrical circuit 
               with goggles and thick gloves, getting a huge cascade of 
               sparks...

                                     HENRY (O.S.)
                         I prayed never to see these again...

               Victor turns. Henry stands in the doorway.

                                     HENRY
                         Whatever they are.

               Henry enters, runs his hand over the gleaming surface of the 
               sarcophagus, circles toward Victor.

                                     HENRY
                         I won't bother asking what or why. 
                         You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just 
                         hope you know what you're doing...
                              (draws close)
                         ...because if this is a repeat of 
                         Ingolstadt, I won't be around to 
                         pick up the pieces.

               CAMERA PUSHES PAST to the Da Vinci print on the wall, contact 
               points still daubed with red...

               EXT - CEMETERY - NIGHT

               CAMERA DRIFTS among the tombstones to reveal an eerie sight:

               SOMEONE hunched in a grave, digging madly, dirt flying. We 
               hear the THUNK of a shovel hitting wood

               INT - COFFIN - NIGHT

               ...and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature. He 
               peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - ANGLE FROM ROOF - NIGHT

               The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping 
               the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder. He pauses 
               as a PAIR OF STABLEHANDS pass far below. He pulls himself 
               onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer 
               window. We see Victor inside as it swings open. The Creature 
               enters with his prize...

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               ...and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the 
               table before us.

               TILT UP TO:

                                     CREATURE
                         I want her.

               Victor stares down in utter horror. Her cold, dead face. 
               Blue lips already beginning to shrivel. Purple, sunken eyes.

               Knowing that she loved him. Knowing it's his fault she's 
               dead. He can barely get the words out:

                                     VICTOR
                         Why... her?

                                     CREATURE
                         Her body pleases me.

               That's it for Victor. He turns away, stomach heaving. It's 
               all he can do to keep from throwing up.

                                     CREATURE
                         Materials, remember? Nothing more. 
                         Your words.

               Victor hesitates, pulling himself together. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         My words.

               He turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying 
               not to view it as someone he knows. He cradles the head, 
               probing the back of the neck with his fingers.

                                     VICTOR
                         The brain stem was destroyed by the 
                         hanging. We'll need another. The 
                         body looks like it will do, but some 
                         extremities are too decayed. They'll 
                         have to be replaced. The fresher the 
                         better.

               EXT - ALLEY - RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT

               Outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a PROSTITUTE 
               servicing a SAILOR in the alley: he's got her pressed against 
               the wall, skirt hiked up. It's not long before he's finished. 
               Off he goes, staggering back into the bar. She arranges her 
               skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a TALL 
               FIGURE in the shadows. Staring. She approaches with her best 
               saucy smile:

                                     PROSTITUTE
                         Want some yourself? Or just like to 
                         watch?
                              (draws close)
                         What do you say, lover? I can make 
                         it good for you.

               The Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to 
               her mouth. His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her 
               off the ground. She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in 
               his palm. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         I know you can.

               And he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine.

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               The dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining 
               her mouth. TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror.

                                     VICTOR
                         What is this?

                                     CREATURE
                         A brain. Extremities.

                                     VICTOR
                         This was not taken from a grave.

                                     CREATURE
                         What does it matter? She'll live 
                         again. You'll make her.

                                     VICTOR
                         No. I draw the line.

               The Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table.

                                     CREATURE
                         You will honor your promise to me!

                                     VICTOR
                              (through gritted teeth)
                         I will not! Kill me now!

                                     CREATURE
                         That is mild compared to what will 
                         come. If you deny me my wedding night. 
                         I'll be with you on yours.

               The Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night.

               Victor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead 
               prostitute. The full horror sinking in.

               INT - ATTIC STAIRCASE - MORNING

               Victor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive 
               padlock. He hurries down the steps.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth, intensity flying:

                                     VICTOR
                         No. Not tomorrow, not next week, 
                         Marry me today.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Why the change? What about your work?

                                     VICTOR
                         It was misguided and pointless. Is 
                         your answer yes?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It is

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll leave this afternoon, right 
                         after the ceremony. Pack only what 
                         you need.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Does this have something to do with 
                         that man you saw?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         Yes. We're in danger here. Every 
                         moment we stay.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, tell me why! Trust me!

                                     VICTOR
                         I do. But you must trust me for now.

               INT - BEDROOM - DAY

               A small ceremony has been hurriedly organized at Father's 
               bedside. The old man holds Elizabeth's hand. Softly:

                                     FATHER
                         This is not... the grand wedding... 
                         I had hoped to give you...

               He releases her hand, giving the bride away. She takes her 
               place at Victor's side. Henry stands as best man. The PRIEST 
               faces them:

                                     PRIEST
                         We gather now in the sight of God to 
                         witness this man and woman bond their 
                         lives in matrimonial vow.

               EXT - MANSION - DAY

               Elizabeth gets in the coach. Claude clambers up to the 
               driver's seat armed with a rifle, ready to pull out. EIGHT 
               MEN on horseback provide armed escort. Victor addresses the 
               men staying behind, all of whom are also armed:

                                     VICTOR
                         Be especially on your guard. Stay 
                         cautious to a fault.

                                     STABLE HAND
                         Who is this man, sir? How shall we 
                         know him?

                                     VICTOR
                         He is huge and deformed... and quite 
                         insane.

                                     CLAUDE
                         He killed Master William and sent 
                         Justine Moritz to the noose! No 
                         hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard 
                         on sight!

               CRIES of assent.

               Victor pulls Henry aside:

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you sure you'll be all right?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, don't worry. I'll look after 
                         your father. You look after her.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll be back as soon as I've got her 
                         far away and safe. We'll hunt this 
                         fiend down together.

                                     HENRY
                         Only if you'll tell me who he is.

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         I owe you that. Done.

               A quick embrace. Victor leaps into the coach.

               ANGLE FROM FATHER'S BEDROOM WINDOW

               The coach clatters up the road, trailed by the eight horsemen. 
               Those left behind scatter across the courtyard.

               Henry turns and walks back toward the house. ANGLE WIDENS to 
               reveal the Creature at the window.  In the bed behind him, 
               The old man stirs, opening his eyes

                                     FATHER
                         Victor?

               ...and sees the Creature turn toward him. Father's eyes go 
               wide as his final stroke is triggered. His life ends with a 
               prolonged death-rattle... and a soft exhale. The Creature 
               reaches down, closes his eyes. A tender gesture.

               A LOUD GASP. The Creature whirls. There stands the priest, 
               dropping his tea to the floor. The Creature sweeps across 
               the room, presses him against the wall.

                                     PRIEST
                              (breathless with horror)
                         You're the Devil himself.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes, and I've come to snatch your 
                         soul...
                              (leans close)
                         ...unless you tell me where they've 
                         gone.

               EXT - LAKE GENEVA - DUSK

               A magnificent sunset bathes the mountains as storm clouds 
               roll in. A ferry is crossing the lake, moving away from us, 
               rippling the water. TILT DOWN to reveal...

               EXT - FERRY DOCK - DUSK

               Claude trotting to the window of the coach.

                                     CLAUDE
                         That was the last ferry. There's 
                         nothing else till morning.

                                     VICTOR
                         Damn it

                                     CLAUDE
                         We'll ride on ahead and secure you 
                         lodging for the night.

               EXT - RESORT - NIGHT

               A big chalet nestled in the woods by the lake. The storm is 
               raging. Claude and his men are positioned at the entrances.

                                     VICTOR
                         Make sure you keep your pistols dry

                                     GUARD #2
                         They're dry enough. And if they fail, 
                         we've others. And if those fail...
                              (draws his saber 
                              halfway)
                         ...we can always gut the bastard.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded. 
                         Now why don't you go upstairs to 
                         your wife? It's not often a man has 
                         his wedding night.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles.

               Elizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted 
               through the sheer white nightgown.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You're soaking.

               She approaches, peels off his coat. Victor stares at her, 
               awe-struck. She sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms 
               demurely... then laughs at her own modesty.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister no more.

                                     VICTOR
                         Now husband and wife.

               He strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips.

                                     VICTOR
                         I remember the first time I ever saw 
                         you. Crossing the floor of the grand 
                         ballroom with my parents at your 
                         side. So beautiful even then.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (a whisper)
                         I have been waiting for this ever 
                         since.

               She leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, 
               triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable...

               ...kissing, caressing, Victor stripping off his wet shirt, 
               CAMERA DRIFTING around them in slow circles, candles spinning 
               like a fever that's been building for a lifetime... and now 
               onto the bed. Magnificent and canopied. Kneeling together, 
               bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining...

               Elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. Victor 
               sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up 
               the nightgown, making her shudder with desire...

               ...and a SHOT FIRES. Victor jerks up. He can hear SHOUTING.

               He rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed 
               and ready on the nightstand.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor!

                                     VICTOR
                         Open this door for no-one!

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               Victor sails past the GUARD at the entrance, brandishing his 
               pistols. The men converge, shouting in the rain:

                                     GUARD #2
                         I saw him in a flash of lightning! 
                         He vanished toward the lake!

                                     CLAUDE
                         Get after him!

               Several men race off in pursuit. TILT UP from Victor and 
               Claude... as a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the Creature 
               clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent 
               smile. He scurries  silently up, further and further into 
               the tree... closer and closer to the balcony.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth. Tense and waiting. A shadow looms across the 
               balcony... spilling through the French doors... onto the 
               floor... a bony hand reaches for the latch...

               The doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain, Elizabeth 
               spins as candles blow out all over the room. The Creature 
               enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't bother to scream.

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men come running back from the lake. They stop before 
               Victor and Claude.

                                     GUARD #3
                         We lost him.

               And GUARD #4's eyes drift up:

                                     GUARD #4
                         Why are those open?

               Victor spins, gazing up. Breath catching in his throat. The 
               French doors are swaying in the wind.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves 
               inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She 
               makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, 
               spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light 
               of the fireplace.

               The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes 
               between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She 
               peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You don't want to hurt me.

               He averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty.

                                     CREATURE
                         You're more lovely than I could ever 
                         have imagined.

               FOOTSTEPS come pounding up the stairs. A HEAVY CRASH of men 
               throwing their shoulders at the door...

                                     VICTOR
                         ELIZABETH!

               ...and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls.

               She tries to wrench away. He spins her around so he won't 
               have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. 
               He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest 
               with pile-driver force...

               INT - LANDING (OUTSIDE ROOM) - NIGHT

               ...and her SCREAM is cut short. The men give one last mighty 
               rush at the door...

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               ...and they burst in just in time to see Elizabeth cascade 
               back onto the bed, her chest a massive red stain. The Creature 
               whips toward them, fist glistening with blood...

                                     CREATURE
                         I keep my promises.

               ...and he races across the room as the men OPEN FIRE, 
               shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade 
               of shots. But the Creature is too fast. He hits the leaded 
               window head-on with the force of an anvil...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               ...and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of 
               shattering glass. He drops 40 feet to the grass below and 
               vanishes like the breeze, greatcoat whipping into darkness.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor rushes to the bad and lets loose the most PRIMAL SCREAM 
               OF ALL. He sweeps his limp, murdered bride into his arms, 
               cradling her to his breast, screams trailing off into wracking 
               moans and sobs of despair:

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         Oh God... he took her heart... he 
                         took her heart from me...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men make way as Victor carries his dead wife through the 
               downpour. He puts her in the coach. Dazed.

               EXT - ROAD - NIGHT

               The coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a 
               frenzy, faster and faster.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop. Victor jumps 
               down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps. Henry 
               appears, rushing out into the rain. Victor goes right past 
               him...

               MANSION - NIGHT

               ...and carries Elizabeth through the silent halls.

               ATTIC - NIGHT

               The door swings in. Victor stands dripping. Holding Elizabeth. 
               Gazing at the gleam of copper...

               MONTAGE:

               And we launch into the final throbbing madness. Victor hacking 
               and chopping. Discarding pieces. Sewing the creation, yanking 
               the catgut tight. Ramming the needles deep. Hoisting the 
               body in the air. Slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening 
               the bolts. Powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the 
               switch. Screaming at God as the LIGHTNING FLASHES and the 
               body convulses. Wind and rain sweeping through the lab, 
               battering a window open and shut, open and shut. Lowering 
               the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb. Releasing the 
               eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the 
               spasming egg The body. Convulsing. Lashing. Screaming in the 
               copper womb. Hair whipping in the fluid...

               Victor shuts down the machinery. He opens the tank and reaches 
               into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves. He pulls out 
               his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle 
               a newborn infant's...

               ...And wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal 
               Elizabeth's face, Massive suture marks bisect her neck and 
               collarbone where pieces were joined. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Live.

               Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to 
               draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. She erupts, thrashing 
               in the vat. He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start 
               her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft 
               murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave 
               violently to dispel the fluid...

               He lifts her gently out. Wipes off the muck as she shivers 
               and shakes, spasms easing off. Cleansing her face. Clasping 
               her hand in his. Comfort and strength...

               Helping her to her feet. Jerky and unsure. Lean on me.

               Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, 
               draping it... and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up 
               with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name.

               Blank. Dazed. Stunned. Not a flicker of recognition.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you 
                         remember. Say my name.

               Nothing. He leans forward... and kisses her dead lips.

               Gentle as a sigh. A flicker in her eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         You must. You must.

               Maybe his imagination. Still whispering:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name. Say you remember.

               And slowly... ever so slowly... she raises her bony white 
               hand before her eyes... staring at it... trying to puzzle it 
               out... its meaning... perhaps the vaguest shred of 
               recognition... and the hand continues to rise... creeping 
               slowly toward his shoulder... and coming to rest there. He 
               smiles, blinking back tears...

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes. I'll help you remember.

               And he takes her other hand in his. At first it's 
               imperceptible... just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, 
               perhaps just a shift of balance... and then it grows into 
               the vaguest sway... and tears are glistening in Victor's 
               eyes as she begins to move. Lurching. Faltering. Unsure.

               You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for 
               guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong.

               Trace memories.

               A waltz.

               And here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and 
               hair-raisingly demented image of the film: Frankenstein dances 
               with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to 
               remember, please remember, and now our WALTZ/LOVE THEME really 
               comes back to haunt us as the MUSIC SWELLS, incredibly lush 
               and deranged, dissonant and echoing through Victor's head, 
               music only he can hear...

                                     VICTOR
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.

               ...and the worst part? The very worst thing of all? There on 
               the shelf. A large formaldehyde jar. Justine's severed head. 
               Watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes. 
               Watching them dance. Still a wallflower? No. She's finally 
               finishing her dance with Victor... most of her, anyway. Under 
               the circumstances, it'll have to do...

               ...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in 
               glorious circles as a dazzling array of LIGHTNING bathes 
               them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening 
               across the walls, INSANE MUSIC swelling louder and louder, 
               climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo 
               with jagged glass claws...

               ...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in. 
               Music echoes abruptly away into silence. Nothing now but 
               rain and distant thunder. In the doorway:

                                     CREATURE
                         She's beautiful.

                                     VICTOR
                         She's not for you.

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. 
                         Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper 
                         suitor.

               The Creature raises his hand. Beckoning. She takes a faltering 
               step. Drawn to him.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth, no!
                              (she turns, puzzled)
                         Say my name.

               Her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain-damaged 
               child who's wet the bed. She knows she's supposed to 
               remember... but can't remember what remembering means.

               They both motion to her. Murmuring. Begging. She's caught 
               between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war.

               Please... come with me. Please... remember. She finally tilts 
               toward the Creature. Gazing into his eyes. Studying his face. 
               Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. A beat. A 
               frown. A puzzlement. This isn't right. People don't look 
               like this. They're not stitched together out of pieces of 
               flesh like a patchwork.

               She looks at her own hands. Dead and white. Not even hers.

               One belongs to Justine. Another to a prostitute, suture scars 
               marring the wrist. She looks down at herself. The dead, 
               sagging breasts. The body that isn't hers either. Realization 
               creeping into her eyes. Realization and horror. Turning to 
               Victor. Why do I look like this? What's happened to me? Oh 
               God, what's happened to me?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Vic... tor?

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no...

               ...and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest 
               pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. 
               She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to 
               find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to 
               peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her 
               own eyes.

               Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering 
               toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. 
               The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside.

                                     CREATURE
                         GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!

                                     VICTOR
                         SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY 
                         NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!

               Yes. She remembers. Not much, but enough. She breaks away 
               from them as they grapple, still SHRIEKING as she sails across 
               the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying...

               ...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before 
               they can stop her.

                                     VICTOR
                         NO!

               She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay 
               with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. 
               But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing 
               in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her... 
               loathing for herself for what she's become.

               It turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no 
               part of it... or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp 
               in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. 
               WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts 
               past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead 
               flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as 
               she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the 
               Creature racing after her...

               INT - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

               ...and she sails down the hallway, setting FIRE to everything 
               she passes, SCREAMING for the final torment to end. She hurls 
               herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she 
               plummets to the floor far below. A pillar of flame leaps up 
               on impact.

               VICTOR AND THE CREATURE face each other as flames sweep the 
               walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in 
               Hell.

                                     VICTOR
                         You killed her! You killed her!

               He hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning 
               down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. The Creature gazes 
               down at his Maker one last time...

                                     CREATURE
                         We killed her.

               And then vanishes through the smoke and flames.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               The once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath 
               a merciless gray sky. Charred beams and drifting smoke are 
               all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family.

               Victor stands gazing at the house. A windswept, hollow man 
               Bundled in a rough coat. Flintlock rifle dangling at his 
               side. Henry moves into frame some distance behind. Softly:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor.

               No reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard.

               He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack 
               horse. The animal stands saddled and ready.

               He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a 
               restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a 
               stranger... and then his features soften.

                                     VICTOR
                         All that I once loved lies in a 
                         shallow grave. By my hand.

                                     HENRY
                         Let it go.

               Victor pauses, emotions swirling. Wishing he could grab the 
               dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered... but knowing 
               the thread is a bittersweet illusion. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         You should have been my father's 
                         son. He would have been so proud.

               Victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his 
               horse. Henry runs after him, shouting:

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! COME BACK!

               But Victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance. 
               The past is dead. Henry watches Victor until he's gone from 
               sight, as Willie did so long ago...

               EXT - MONT BLANC GLACIER - DAY

               The solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept 
               glacier ...

               INT - THE CREATURE'S CAVE - DAY

               Victor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled. The cave is 
               now deserted, all possessions gone, a scorched black spot 
               where the campfire had been...

               EXT - GLACIER - DAY

               A panorama of snow. Pristine... save for the long trail of 
               footprints stretching off before us.

               Victor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy 
               horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor.

               He slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by 
               the reins. Dwindling across the frozen landscape.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I followed his trail north... always 
                         north... and always one step behind... 
                         never stopping... driven by my fires 
                         of rage... and revenge...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - TWILIGHT

               Victor lies in Walton's bed, sallow as a corpse, barely able 
               to speak, drained now of everything.

                                     VICTOR
                         A year now I've followed him. Perhaps 
                         more. Only to arrive at this place. 
                         Tired. So very tired. I never did 
                         find... whatever it was... I was 
                         looking for... and neither will you, 
                         my friend.
                              (off Walton's look)
                         Value life above ambition... or those 
                         glittering prizes you seek will 
                         crumble to dust in your fingers... 
                         as they have in mine.
                              (reaches out feverishly)
                         See your loved ones again. I cannot.

               Walton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest. 
               Softly:

                                     WALTON
                         Rest now.

               Victor is silent. His breathing shallow. Walton just sits 
               And waits...

               A SLOW DISSOLVE marks the passage of Walton's long vigil...

               Victor's eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen. 
               Perhaps, the faces of those he loved. The eyes glaze. A 
               peaceful death. Walton rises. Puts on his heavy coat to ward 
               off the chill. Exits the cabin.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - TWILIGHT

               Grigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the 
               ice. His coat is open. Walton joins him. Surprised at how 
               warm it is. He holds up his hand, testing the breeze.

                                     WALTON
                         A warming wind.

                                     GRIGORI
                         This ice will break yet.
                              (glances over)
                         How's our guest?

                                     WALTON
                         He died. Raving about phantoms. He 
                         was mad, poor devil.
                              (beat)
                         Gather a detail. Have the body removed 
                         from my cabin.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Aye, Captain.

               Grigori moves off to gather help. Walton turns and heads 
               back to his cabin.

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Walton enters... and freezes at the sound of SOFT WEEPING.

               He can't see the bad from here. Could it be the dead man? He 
               glances down. Wet footprints lead across the floor.

               He eases forward. The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into 
               view. A DARK FIGURE is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding 
               the corpse's hand. Walton is stunned.

                                     WALTON
                         Who are you?

               The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim 
               yellow light:

                                     CREATURE
                         He never gave me a name.

               Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath. He lunges to the 
               desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen 
               beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up. Eyes dancing with 
               fear and speculation. The Creature makes no move. Unconcerned.

                                     CREATURE
                         You were with him at the end.

                                     WALTON
                              (finds his voice)
                         Yes.

                                     CREATURE
                         I was watching.

               Walton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the 
               breeze, chilled at the thought. The Creature returns his 
               gaze to Victor.

                                     CREATURE
                         I longed to be with him. But I wanted 
                         his final moments to have peace. I 
                         could see you were a friend to him.

                                     WALTON
                         What is that to you? Evil as you 
                         are.

                                     CREATURE
                              (swivels his gaze)
                         I am as he made me. In his own image.

                                     WALTON
                         You drove him to his torment.

                                     CREATURE
                         And he drove me to mine.

                                     WALTON
                         Then why weep for him?

                                     CREATURE
                         Would you not? He was father. And 
                         mother. We fell from grace together. 
                         He from his God. I from mine.

               The Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek. He reaches up 
               with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         Could we ever have forgiven?

               The question goes unanswered. The Creature rises, gliding in 
               shadow to the door. Pauses.

                                     CREATURE
                         I've never been shown a kindness. 
                         Show me one now.

                                     WALTON
                         What kindness?

                                     CREATURE
                         Build for him a pyre. Light up the 
                         sky with his passing.

               And then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the 
               night...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen 
               mast, axes rising and falling in waves...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier 
               of wood, stacked and lashed. His body is wrapped in rough 
               canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice.

               Walton and crew stand facing the bier. Walton silently reads 
               a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small 
               campfire drifts past.

               Walton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances 
               to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other 
               men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it.

               Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He 
               dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men 
               back away, preparing for the coming blaze...

               ...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The 
               men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their 
               bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in 
               frame. Loping slowly over the ice. Approaching.

                                     PILOT
                              (softly)
                         Christ.

               Grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks 
               the flintlock. Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, 
               denying his aim.

                                     WALTON
                         It has a right to bear witness.

               Grigori hesitates, nods. If you say so. The men grow more 
               unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. 
               Men start backing toward the ship.

                                     WALTON
                         Stand fast. All of you.

               The men stand fast. The Creature stops some thirty yards 
               out. A silent tableau on the ice. The men facing the Creature. 
               Walton holding the torch. The pyre waiting for the kiss of 
               flame. Walton moves forward...

               ...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads 
               as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some 
               fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again.

               It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an 
               earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and 
               force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK!

               Ice cascading skyward.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!

                                     GRIGORI
                              (whips toward Walton)
                         TORCH THE DAMN THING!

               Walton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The 
               torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back.

                                     WALTON
                         BACK TO THE SHIP!

               The men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full 
               retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for 
               miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton 
               to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A 
               heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go 
               for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve...

                                     GRIGORI
                         LEAVE IT!

               ...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift 
               opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course 
               across the ice, separating them from the torch.

               They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the 
               others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels.

               THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein 
               snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice.

               NO

               He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a 
               massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of 
               cascading water and spinning fragments.

               THE NEVSKY

               The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to 
               the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the 
               ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see:

               THE CREATURE

               racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a 
               wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him 
               from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.

               THE NEVSKY

               breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, 
               triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew 
               hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet 
               into the icy water.

               THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped 
               on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to 
               plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice 
               crashing down after him. Gone.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI  are knocked flat as a fissure appears 
               between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a 
               teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back 
               but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping 
               maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him.

               Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag 
               him off... but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the 
               ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori 
               thunderously into the drink.

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as 
               she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching 
               the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to 
               the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their 
               fellows from the water, hauling them to safety.

               FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on 
               its own ice floe.

               THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning.

               ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL

               Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces 
               of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming:

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and 
               strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms 
               thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight 
               of his own clothing.

               Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water 
               himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's 
               dying right in front of Walton's eyes.

                                     WALTON
                         SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!

               Too late. Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing 
               for good beneath the frigid water. Gone. Walton throws his 
               head back with a bellow of anguish...

               ...and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And 
               impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against 
               the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. He 
               gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... 
               and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and 
               up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath 
               him. The face of a nightmare.

               The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air 
               right into Walton's arms. Both men go sprawling. Walton 
               scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature.

               The monster is exhausted. Near his limit. Walton thrusts out 
               his arm, fingers grasping to help.

                                     WALTON
                         Swim.

               The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting 
               away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to 
               him. Come. Grab my hand.

               The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the 
               torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps 
               him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice.

               CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered 
               by ice floes on all sides. Going under.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated 
               ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding 
               nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught.

               Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water 
               and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard.

               BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony 
               fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand.

               The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion 
               and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high.

               Swims grimly on.

               ABOARD THE NEVSKY

               The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men 
               shivering with exposure. Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing 
               off. The men crowd to his-side.

               THE CREATURE swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch 
               held high to keep it burning. Relentlessly determined. This 
               is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. Gasping and 
               sinking beneath the surface...

               ...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe 
               upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre. He hauls himself 
               from the water. Moving now in a slow-motion litany of 
               exhaustion. Climbing the pyre. Scaling the wood. Seeking the 
               top. Never giving up.

               The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the 
               wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's 
               way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across 
               the River Styx. Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his 
               creation's knees, content to be shown the way...

               The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading 
               his arms wide in sublime triumph. Feeling the wind on his 
               skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. Cold. 
               So very cold.

               He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, 
               pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. He looks 
               down. At Frankenstein. The oil-soaked canvas. The saturated 
               wood. There's that smell. Yes. He scoops Victor up with his 
               free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother 
               comforting a baby.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror. Realization dawning:

                                     GRIGORI (SOFTLY)
                         Don't do it...
                              (screaming)
                         FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!

               THE CREATURE

               turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering 
               in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the 
               sympathy held so long sought. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         For God's sake... I will.

               And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him. White-hot 
               ignition. Ultimate redemption. WHUMP! A massive BALL OF FLAME 
               engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. 
               Blossoming. Roiling.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as:

               THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant 
               wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair 
               going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, 
               peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from 
               bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. 
               Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps 
               it never will...

               FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight 
               trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams 
               echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance.

               WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The 
               borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers 
               of lightning kiss the world. Softly:

                                     WALTON
                         Home

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The 
               Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through 
               a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK.

		NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

				by Lewis Abernathy


	FADE IN:

	EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

	MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
	Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
	The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(in chorus)
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
	lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
	Elm Street 1 & 2).

	Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
	house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
	children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
	and jumprope on the front walk.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Three... four... better lock your
		door.

	Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
	"4" drawn on concrete.

	Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
	from Nightmare 3 & 4).

	Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
	little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
	peeling away.

	Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
	it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
	porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Five... six...

	RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

	The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
	we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
	find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
	nighttime.

	The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
	stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
	back to the little girl.

	But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
	remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
	and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
	it into the...


	INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
	cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
	Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
	tries to open it -- locked.

	Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
	trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
	GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy?

	Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
	following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
	belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
	end of the hallway, moving into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

	On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
	old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
	draws with crayons.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy. What are you doing here?

				LIZZY
		Playing with my friend.

	Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
	of Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		Your friend?

				LIZZY
		He lives under the bed.

	Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
	Lizzy's bed.

	Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
	the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
	the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
	tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		You scared him...

	Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

				MEAGAN
		I scared him?

	But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Lizzy?

	Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
	in the...


	INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
	a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
	goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
	-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
	all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
	down.

	The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
	Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

	Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

				FREDDY
		Where ya been all my death, baby?

	Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
	tuxedo, crooning:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've been waitin' at the altar for
		a long, long time!

	Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
	spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
	filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
	of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
	asks:

				SATANIC PRIEST
		Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

	Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
	dressed in body bags.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		And the groomsmen...?

	Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
	trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		If anyone here believes that these
		two should not be joined in unholy
		matrimony, let him speak now or
		forever rot in hell...

	>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

				JESSE
		Meagan!

	Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
	in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
	outstretched.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
	encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
	eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

	It's Jason.

	Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
	it down between her eyes...

						TRANSITION CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
	was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
	dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
	on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
	a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
	with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
	she notices something not quite right about the doll.
	She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
	a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy...

	Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

				FREDDY DOLL
		Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

	The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
	thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

	Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
	She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
	Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
	dream.

	ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
	with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
	pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
	out of bed...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
	her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
	tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
	glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
	head.

				MEAGAN
		Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
		up.

	Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
	then frowns.

				LIZZY
		I had a bad dream.

				MEAGAN
		Me, too.

				LIZZY
		I was scared.

				MEAGAN
		Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

				LIZZY
		Promise?

				MEAGAN
		Promise.

	Lizzy hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		I'll never let anyone hurt you.


	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
	A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
	SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
	NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
	the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
	surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
	house.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(filtered)
		As the sun rises on yet another
		morning, still no end in sight for
		the standoff between police and the
		mysterious group known only as the
		"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
		house behind me just thirteen days
		ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
		away teenagers -- have managed to
		keep police at bay for almost two
		weeks while inside they take mind-
		altering narcotics in order to
		communicate with their god --
		Freddy.

	The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
	where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
	down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
	who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
	herself a cup and sits.

				MEAGAN
		Morning.

	Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
	looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
	just a little too cheerfully:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Morning, Meagan.

	Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
	father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
	Meagan's mom bellows:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
			(calls upstairs)
		Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
		is almost ready!

	Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
	into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

	ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

				NEWS REPORTER
		Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
		was released on a legal technicality
		but later burned to death at the
		hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
		parents.  Some years later, a rash
		of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
		age deaths began leaving many in
		the area to wonder... is Freddy
		really dead?

	Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
	breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
	pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
	family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
	Tart, whining.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Hurry up and eat. You don't want
		to be late for special school.

				MEAGAN
		Mom! Don't call it that!

				LIZZY
		I hate that school. The other kids
		are mean... and they're all re-
		tard-ed!

	Meagan snickers.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We don't use that word. They're
		"special" children just like you're
		"special".

	Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
	Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
	the paper.

	ANGLE ON TV --

				NEWS REPORTER
		The cult members have declined to
		an on-camera interview but did send
		out a note with a message. The note
		-- which, by the way, appears to
		have been written in blood -- reads...
			(reads the note)
		To the parents of Springwood --
		Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
		take one of your children as his
		virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
		and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
		-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
		shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
		to rise and rule the darkness forever
		and ever.

	A horn TOOTS outside.

				MEAGAN
		That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

	Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
	dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Oh, look at the time! I've got to
		be going... anyone need me to bring
		anything home tonight?

				MEAGAN
		I need an alarm clock.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		What's wrong with your old one?

				MEAGAN
		Broke.

	Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
	door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're almost out of vodka.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

				JESSE
		Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

				MEAGAN
		My mom...

				JESSE
		And...?

				MEAGAN
		I had another dream last night...

				JESSE
		Was I naked?

				MEAGAN
		No. You were Jason.

				JESSE
		Jason? Oh, yeech...
			(then)
		Was I any good?

	Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


	INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
	his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
	say something.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Do you have to watch that crap all
		the time? Months and months of the
		O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

	Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
	slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
	then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
	into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
	switches the set back on.

	CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
	RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

				NEWS REPORTER
		I'm standing here with State Trooper
		Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
		Governor has called in to deal with
		the cultists because of his past
		experience with occult-style
		murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
		is the only law enforcement officer
		ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
		with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
		killer -- Jason Voorhees.
			(to Murdoch)
		You received some pretty nasty
		injuries in your battle with Jason,
		didn't you, Captain?

				MURDOCH
		Nothing serious... just a few
		stitches.

				NEWS REPORTER
		What about these so called "Freddy"
		cultists? They seem like pretty
		tough customers. Think you'll have
		any trouble getting them out of
		there?

				MURDOCH
		No. Now that the Governor has given
		me complete authority to deal with
		these punks I should be putting an
		end to their situation pretty quick.
		Unless of course their attorney is
		able to get them to come out peace-
		fully... but I don't hold out much
		hope for that.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(to camera)
		Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
		gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
		criminals.

	EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
	to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

				MURDOCH
		Damn media... oughtta be a law.
			(gestures to house)
		Is that shyster still in there
		trying to talk them out?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... he's making them some kind
		of deal.

				MURDOCH
		Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
		assholes. Shakespeare was right --
		kill all the lawyers. Then we could
		kill all the punks with no hassles
		and the world would be a safer place.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Smaller anyway.

				MURDOCH
		Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
		Long-haired, English freak. He was
		probably a punk.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

	Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
	is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
	He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
	punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
	They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
	flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
	disfigured faces.

	The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
	takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
	neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
	his nose nervously as he speaks:

				SLEAZY LAWYER
		So, as I explained to you before,
		the revenues between the TV movie
		deal and the book sale should be
		adequate to fund your joint-defense.
		And I think with my mass media
		hypnosis argument I could get each
		of you a reduced sentence on appeal
		-- say... twenty years each. Out
		in fifteen with good behavior?
		Hmmmmm?

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
	an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
	windshield with a loud SPLAT!

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Jesus Christ!

	Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
	the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
	.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
	the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
	SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

	The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
	of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
	S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
	with foil, the walls have been painted black with
	cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
	black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
	night vision goggles and starts moving through the
	house.

	P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
	team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
	the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
	light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
	face.

	Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
	team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
	guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
	opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
	a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
	starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
	a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
	his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
	have been shredded to the bone.

	Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
	steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
	swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
	His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
	gun.

	The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
	bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
	the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
	room behind them.

	CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
	covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
	both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
	The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
	barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
	the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

	Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
	He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
	cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
	the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

				MURDOCH
		Freeze!

	Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

	The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
	retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
	cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
	guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
	thunder down a back staircase to the...


	INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
	house and most escape through the underground tunnel
	just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
	the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
	is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
	S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hold your fire!

	He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
	flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
	smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
	to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
	-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
	ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Help me, mister... please.

	The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
	down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
	tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
	timer.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hang on, honey... I'll have you
		out of there in a second.

	Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
	passageway and says:

				MURDOCH
		Looks like we'll have to hunt the
		rest of them down. Let's go before
		they get too far.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		We can't leave! Can't you see
		we've got a situation here?

	Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

				MURDOCH
		Leave her.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You're crazy! I can't just leave
		her!

				MURDOCH
		Forget it. I've seen this before.
		There's nothing you can do.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I've got to try...

	The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
	to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
	23... 22...

	The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
	of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
	team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

				MURDOCH
		You're wasting your time.

	The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
	second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
	13...

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Fuck it!

	The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
	and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
	in his arms as he shouts to his men:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing; yelling)
		CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

	The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
	bringing up the rear.


	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
	girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
	and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
	the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
	-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

	Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
	mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks.

	As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
	the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Are you okay, honey?

	Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
	commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Freddy lives!

	With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
	commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
	his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
	He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
	takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
	style.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		NO!

	The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
	time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
	dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing)
		Jesus... you were going to kill
		that kid, weren't you?

				MURDOCH
		I told you you were wasting your
		time. Once these kids go rabid,
		best thing to do is put 'em down.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You can't be serious...

				MURDOCH
		Dead serious. See... the world is
		made up of rules. Kids don't like
		rules. They rebel for a while, but
		ultimately they start to fall in
		line and become ordinary Joe's like
		you and me. But some kids... dope
		smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
		Satanic lyrics melting what's left
		of their brains... these kids grow
		up to be punks. And when these punks
		step as far over the line as these
		"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
		peace officers have no choice but
		to kill them.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I didn't become a peace officer to
		kill kids.

				MURDOCH
		Punks. There's a difference...
			(under his breath)
		...barely.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
	LIVES!

	We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
	it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
	instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

				MISS KREPPS
		(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

	It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
	struggling to stay awake while others have already
	passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
	She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
	in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
	fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
	on:

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

	Meagan starts to drift off, when...

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing; loud)
		Meagan!?

				MEAGAN
		Yes, ma'am?

				MISS KREPPS
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your oral report?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I'm ready.

				MISS KREPPS
		Please come up here to the podium.

	Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
	snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
	snaps her fingers for quiet.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		You won't think it's funny when
		you haven't learned the fundamentals
		of a free market economy... oh,
		why do I waste my breath? You're
		all going to grow up to be gas
		station attendants and waitresses
		anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		My report is on Global Economic
		Trends.
			(clears throat;
				 begins reading)
		Try and think of a world where there
		is no poverty... no sickness... no
		crime. A world where everyone is
		happy to be alive and everyone lives
		together in peace. This is my dream.

	The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
	BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
	with her report.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		This dream is becoming a reality
		with ever-growing international
		business...

	CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
	turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
	louder.

				MISS KREPPS
		Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

	Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
	voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
	report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
	WIND increases.

	A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
	spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
	to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
	it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
	billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
	with laughter.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		Louder, Meagan... we still can't
		hear you.

	But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
	busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
	the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
	over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
	blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
	that too is swept off.

	Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
	to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
	naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
	face.

	Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
	all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
	in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
	wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

				FREDDY
		Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
		to blow!

	Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
	of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
	pleading:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse... please, help me.

	But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
	up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
	expressionless face.

				FREDDY
		Looks like a photo opportunity to
		me!

	Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
	flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
	beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
	front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
	sneers:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Say... cheesecake!

	PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
	light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
	against the blackboard -- vaporized!

					HARD CUT TO:

	Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
	as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

				MISS KREPPS
		Meagan? Meagan?!

	Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your report?

	Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
	herself together.

				MEAGAN
		Sure...

	Meagan stands up and faints.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

	MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
	standing over her.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
		know where you are?

	Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

				MEAGAN
		I was day dreaming and then I woke
		up but then it was like I was still
		dreaming and then I woke up and
		then I guess I fainted and now I'm
		awake again...

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Are you sure?

	Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(continuing)
		Meagan?

				MEAGAN
		I'm waiting to see if you're going
		to turn into Freddy.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Freddy... I see. You've been watching
		too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
		cult thing -- it's all over the TV
		day and night -- you can't get away
		from it. No wonder you kids are all
		having nightmares.

				MEAGAN
		But this one was different... it
		felt real.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
		aren't real. They're just broken
		fragments of the subconscious mind.

				MEAGAN
		Fear is real though, isn't it? And
		if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
		that make them real?!
			(gets excited)
		And if the nightmares are real then
		is reality like a dream?!

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(cutting her off)
		Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
		that's all.

	The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
	nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

				MEAGAN
		Old witch... what does she know?
		She isn't even qualified to give a
		shot and she's telling me that my
		dreams aren't anything to worry
		about.

				JESSE
		So she said you were okay?

				MEAGAN
		Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
		says it's just a case of heat pro-
		stration and an overdose of TV news.
		Ruined my makeup, too.

				JESSE
		So you're going back to class?

				MEAGAN
		No. She gave me last period off.

				JESSE
		Well, what are you bitching about?
		I could have a compound fracture of
		the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
		from P.E.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! I've been having nightmares
		for almost two weeks now and they
		keep getting worse! Now I'm having
		daymares! I want to know why!

				JESSE
		Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
		it was heat probation?

	Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

				MEAGAN
		You don't understand... I want to
		know more about dreams. What they
		mean... why we have them.

				JESSE
		Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
		got the rest of the day off, that's
		all I'm saying.

				MEAGAN
		That's a good idea. Why don't you
		cut last period and come with me?

				JESSE
		Sure. Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				JESSE
		You want me to cut school so we can
		go to the library?

					   CUT TO:

	INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

	Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
	the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Find anything?

	Jesse looks up suddenly.

				JESSE
		What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

	Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
	TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Did you know that our sub-conscious
		retains everything that ever happened
		to us? Everything. From the time
		we're born until we die.

				JESSE
		Really?

				MEAGAN
		That's how Freddy gets at us...
		by using our sub-conscious fears.
		Fears our conscious minds have
		repressed or forgotten.

				JESSE
		I've got a news flash for you...
		Freddy's dead.

				MEAGAN
		I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
		in our sub-conscious then he can
		never be fully erased. Like a bad
		memory... you may blot it out of
		your mind but it will alway be
		hiding someplace in your dreams.
			(off Jesse's
				 disbelieving stare)
		Weren't you scared as a child by
		something so stupid that you're
		ashamed to admit it?

				JESSE
		No.

				MEAGAN
		No?

				JESSE
		Well, yeah.

				MEAGAN
		Well, what? What is it?

				JESSE
		Well... when I was kid, my brother
		took me to the carnival. And in the
		penny arcade there was this robot
		gunslinger...

				MEAGAN
		Black Bart.

				JESSE
		You know about Black Bart?

				MEAGAN
		Duh. You put your quarter in and he
		says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
		And then you pull your gun out and
		shoot him.

				JESSE
		That's just it -- I never could!
		I'd point the gun right at him and
		shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
		So I always got killed.

				MEAGAN
		No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

				JESSE
		Scared the shit out of me.

	Meagan tries to hide her smile.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 flustered)
		Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
		kid?

	Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 mad)
		Okay, smartass... what about you?
		What scared you the most as a kid?

	A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

				MEAGAN
		I remember... Lizzy wandered off
		one day and we couldn't find her.
		The police came and everything. I
		wasn't really worried until I saw
		her picture on TV... then I got
		really scared.
			(then)
		Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
		think something bad's going to
		happen.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
	her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
	her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
	disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

				LEONARD
		You're stupid!

				LIZZY
		No, you are!

				LEONARD
		They forgot you again!

				LIZZY
		No, they didn't!

				LEONARD
		Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
		to wait out here until it's dark
		and then the monsters are goin'
		come and get you!

				LIZZY
		No they won't, because I'm walkin'
		home!

	Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
	calls after her:

				LEONARD
		Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
		me! I got forgot too, you know!

	Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
	yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
	bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
	down as he follows after Lizzy.

				LEONARD
			(continuing)
		Okay... I'm going to have to report
		this!

	Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
	she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
	standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
	Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
	glances back, the figure is still standing... but
	closer.

	Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
	she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
	street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
	of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
	reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

	The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
	it roars off down the street.

	CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
	in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
	car and rushes inside.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
	calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
	Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Didn't you get my message?

				MEAGAN
		What message?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		I called the school after lunch...
		I had to stay late after work...
		I...

	Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
	she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
	drunk and has been crying.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Don't you dare blame this on her,
		you sorry bastard! It's all your
		fault!
			(to Meagan)
		Where have you been anyway?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		A likely Goddamn story!

	Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

				MEAGAN
		Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
		Where's Lizzy?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		She didn't come home from school
		today. The police got a report that
		a girl fitting Lizzy's description
		was forced into a car by some
		crazies. They're pretty sure it was
		this "Freddy" cult.

				MEAGAN
			(shocked)
		Oh, my God...

	Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
	comfort her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Now don't worry. The police are
		doing everything they can.

	Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
	men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

				TROOPER
			(O.S.)
		Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
		up here!


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

	As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
	the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
	the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
	attention to the floor next to the bed.

	Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
	including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
	the top.

	Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

				TROOPER
		Looks like she was in the cult all
		along.

				MEAGAN
		No... no, she wouldn't do that!
		Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

				TROOPER
		I know it's hard to believe, miss.
		But a lot of good kids get caught
		up in this kind of trouble.

	Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
	tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
	little unicorn.

				MURDOCH
		Punks...

	Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
	the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Captain Murdoch... is there any-
		thing we can do?

				MURDOCH
		You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
		daughter before... well, before it's
		too late. But rest assured, if I
		can't persuade her to come back to
		her loving home, then I'll do what's
		best for her. I know you and your
		wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
			(to his men)
		Come on... I want to go talk to
		Erwin.

	Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
	Jesse out of the house.

				JESSE
		Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		Over to Stormie's.

				JESSE
		Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
		friends anymore since she stole that
		twenty dollars from you.

				MEAGAN
		That was her "klepto" phase... when
		she was dating that gang member.
		She dumped him a long time ago.

				JESSE
		I still don't understand. What has
		she got to do with Lizzy missing?

				MEAGAN
		She used to be in the Freddy cult.
		Maybe she knows where they took
		Lizzy.

	They exit to Jesse's car.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
	blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

				STORMIE
		If I did know I would call the
		police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
		No telling what those freaks will
		do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
		are hard core.

				JESSE
		I thought you were in the cult?

				STORMIE
		I was in the cult for a week cause
		my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
		he was. But I just liked the music
		and the clothes... when they were
		clean, but not like the violence
		and stuff. But that was just my
		"cult" phase... but I got past that.
		You know, just like my "gang" phase
		when I was dating Ramon and then
		before that was my "death rock"
		phase when I was dating Stuart...

				JESSE
		Uh, excuse me... but what phase
		are we in now?

				STORMIE
		Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
		what's it fuckin' to ya?!

				JESSE
			(to Meagan)
		Why don't you just let the cops find
		her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
		knows how to deal with these cultist
		psychos. He was the man who got Jason
		Voorhees.

				MEAGAN
		That guy in my dreams...

				STORMIE
		Jason kicked his ass.

						   QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

	Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
	younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
	Jason in panic.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
		thirteen bullets in Jason before
		he hacked his head open.

	Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
	staggers back, raising his pistol.

				JESSE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		But even with his head hacked open
		and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
		still managed to put his last bullet
		in Jason's eye.

	Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
	Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
	body hits the ground.


	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

	Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
	Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
	medical contraptions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
		worked at the hospital where they
		took him. He said that Murdoch lost
		more than half his brain and what
		little that was left was all twisted
		up inside. And they had to replace
		his skull with a metal plate to
		keep that from leaking out.

	In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
	eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		They say he hasn't been the same
		since.

					CUT BACK TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

				JESSE
		So what's different about him?

				STORMIE
		One thing... he used to be a
		Democrat. Now he votes straight
		Republican.

				MEAGAN
		I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
		cult or something.

				STORMIE
		Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

				MEAGAN
		I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
		got to find her and save her from
		Freddy before that crazy cop kills
		her.

				JESSE
		Just where are you going to look?
		I mean, these cult guys could be
		holding her anywhere.

				MEAGAN
		Murdoch said something about going
		to talk to somebody named Erwin.

				STORMIE
		Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
		Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
		they took Lizzy!

				JESSE
		Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
		that used to eat bugs?

				STORMIE
			(annoyed)
		Who else?
			(to Meagan; bright)
		Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
		home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
		up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
		Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
		back and the cops put him away for
		his own safety. They say Freddy's
		put a death hex on Erwin.

				JESSE
		A death hex?

				STORMIE
		Yes, a death hex. You know... where
		someone wants you dead!

				MEAGAN
		Where is he?

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

	Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
	and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
	park, Meagan turns to him and says:

				MEAGAN
		I want you to stay here.

				JESSE
		Why?

				MEAGAN
		Don't be mad... it's just that you
		might scare him.

				JESSE
		Scare him?

				STORMIE
		What she's subtly trying to tell
		you is that this needs a woman's
		gentle touch... butthead.

				MEAGAN
		Just stay here... okay?

	Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
	cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
	turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
	the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
	row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
	on the glass.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
		of visitors. Now be a good boy...
			(to Meagan & Stormie)
		You've got five minutes. I'll be
		right down the hall if you need me.

	The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
	thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
	They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
	little closer to the glass.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin...?

	SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
	face to the glass as he screams:

				ERWIN
		SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

	Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
	quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
	inspection.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Where do you shoot?

				MEAGAN
		Shoot?

				STORMIE
		He's talking about dream dope --
		the stuff the cultists shoot up
		with so they can talk to Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		I don't do drugs.

				ERWIN
		You're not in the cult?

				MEAGAN
		No.

				ERWIN
		Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

				MEAGAN/STORMIE
		No.

				ERWIN
		I don't trust you... better take off
		your clothes so I can check you for
		tracks.

				STORMIE
		Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
		hard data -- not a floppy disk.

	Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
	to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
	mattress.

				ERWIN
		Well, what do you want? Can't you
		see I'm busy?

				MEAGAN
		Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

				STORMIE
		I told her you might know where
		they took her.

				ERWIN
		I already told the cops everything
		I know.

				MEAGAN
		Tell me... please.

				ERWIN
		Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
		but I've got my own problems with
		Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

				MEAGAN
		Then tell me why they took her...

				ERWIN
		To bear his child. Freddy wants to
		be human again. In order to do that
		he has to be "reborn".

				MEAGAN
		How can he do that?

				ERWIN
		He has to marry a virgin on holy
		ground. Then the cult consumate
		the marriage by impregnating her.

				STORMIE
		The whole cult? Yeech!

				ERWIN
		Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
		It's sort of a tradition with him.

				MEAGAN
		So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

				ERWIN
		And Freddy enters the soul of the
		fetus through a dream state. Voila!
		Rebirth.

	There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

				STORMIE
		That's the stupidest shit I ever
		heard.

				ERWIN
		Hey, they're not my rules... some-
		body else wrote 'em.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... you've got to help me find
		Lizzy. You're my only hope.

	Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

				ERWIN
		I'll help you find your sister, but
		you've got to help me.

				MEAGAN
		Anything. Just name it.

				ERWIN
		You have to help me kill Freddy.

	Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

				STORMIE
		But Freddy's dead.

				ERWIN
		Freddy lives...
			(looks at Meagan)
		If only in our dreams.

	Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
	her away.

				STORMIE
		Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
		is up. He's giving me the creeps.

	But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

				MEAGAN
		How can you kill a dream?

				ERWIN
		When it's not a dream.
			(then)
		Do we have a deal?

	Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
	thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
	over his.

				MEAGAN
		Deal.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
	a pay phone, arguing.

				JESSE
		No! I won't do it!

				MEAGAN
		Come on, Jesse! Please...?

				JESSE
		It's illegal! I could go to jail!

				STORMIE
		How will they ever know? Don't be
		such a pussy!

				JESSE
		Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

				STORMIE
		Okay, I will!

				MEAGAN
		No! They'll never believe her!

				STORMIE
		I can disguise my voice...
			(lowers voice)
		Hello, how do you do? My name is
		Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
		actually a wimp.

				MEAGAN
		They'll never believe that. Come
		on, Jesse... for me?

				JESSE
		Okay... okay... I'll do it.
			(to Stormie)
		And I'm not a wimp!

	Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
	moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
	both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
	the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
	girls shut up, he says:

				JESSE
			(continuing)
		I need a quarter for the phone.

	Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
	re-enters the booth.

	ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

	The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Springwood Mental Center... how
		can I help you?

				JESSE
			(filtered; disguising
				 his voice)
		There's a bomb planted in your
		building.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Who is this?

				JESSE
		If I were you -- I'd get my ass
		out of there.

	In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
	something to Jesse.

				JESSE
			(continuing; adding)
		Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

	CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

	The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
	fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
	into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
	files out with the others, still wearing his straight
	jacket.

	Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
	flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
	off towards the fence between himself and freedom
	when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

				SECURITY GUARD
		Hey, Erwin... where do you think
		you're going?

	Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

				SECURITY GUARD
			(continuing)
		I'm talking to you, asshole!

	Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
	him.

	In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
	guard closes the distance.

				JESSE
		He's not going to make it.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to do something!

	With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

	Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
	the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
	drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
	Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
	an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
	RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
	does a 180, and PEELS off.

	ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
	of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
	hand to Jesse.

				ERWIN
		Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
		busting me out of there!

	Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
	fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

				JESSE
		Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
		me one favor -- don't eat nothing
		disgusting. My stomach is tight
		enough as it is.

	The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
	puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
	street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
	plucks it out...

	Jesse's front license plate.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

	CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
	close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
	inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
	starts to settle down... falling asleep...

	The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
	her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

	LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
	the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
	gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


	INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
	a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
	is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
	of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
	with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
	hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
	terrible chorus of the damned.

	The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
	the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
	is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
	mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
	swings open as the cultists near.

	The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
	her tight as they push her face forward into the
	mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
	face disappearing into the mirror.

	ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
	face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
	thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
	darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
	the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
	moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
	out.

	The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
	locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
	things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
	the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
	releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

	The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
	the...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
	conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
	as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
	doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
	cultist thrusts under her.

	Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
	mouth -- the Dream Demons.


	EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

	Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
	pulls up next to a run-down building.


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
	old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
	towards the back, to a large table and a collection
	of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
	starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
	syringes laying scattered about the floor.

				ERWIN
		Damn! We must have just missed them!

	Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

				MEAGAN
		Oh, my God -- she was here! This
		is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
		torn!
			(grabs Erwin)
		Erwin... we've got to find her!

				ERWIN
		We're too late! There's no way...
		except...

				MEAGAN
		Except what?!

				ERWIN
		We could go after Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		How?

	Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
	up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
	he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
	box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
	and several pairs of cult shades.

				ERWIN
		We'll inject ourselves with Dream
		Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
		brings on a dreamlike state.

	Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
	approval.

				MEAGAN
		Okay... let's do it!

				JESSE
		Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
		what if one of us gets hooked or
		something?
			(whispers)
		We could turn out like him!

	Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry about it. We need you
		wide awake anyway.

				JESSE
		What for?

				ERWIN
		We're going to go under and try to
		find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
		him and bring him here. Then you
		kill him with this...

	Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

				JESSE
		This rusty chunk of shit? What
		good is this?

				ERWIN
		It's not the gun, it's what's in
		it -- silver bullets blessed by a
		priest.

				JESSE
		Will that work?

				ERWIN
			(shrugs)
		Should. But then...

				JESSE
			(finishes for him)
		You don't make the rules... yeah,
		yeah.

				MEAGAN
		What should we do?

				ERWIN
		Have a seat over there and make
		yourselves comfortable. Roll up
		your sleeves and put these on...

	Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
	sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
	Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

				STORMIE
		Oh, cool!

				MEAGAN
		What are they for?

				ERWIN
		It's how the cult keeps in constant
		contact with Freddy. The little
		lights flashing are a sustained
		occular input that causes your brain
		to resonate at approximately the
		same frequency at which the dream
		state is most likely to occur.

	All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

				STORMIE
		Whatever...
			(to Meagan; excited)
		Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

	Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
	up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
	chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
	takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
	lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
	glasses.

				ERWIN
		It helps to hold hands if you want
		to go together...

	Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
	watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
	a final warning:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		And remember... Freddy knows what
		scares you.

	Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

	INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
	(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
	The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

				ERWIN
		WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
	asleep in their chairs.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
	mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
	pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
	fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
	they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

				LIZZY
			(distant)
		Meagan... help me... please...

	Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
	suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
	and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

				ERWIN
		Freddy's trying to split us up...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
	mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
	and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
	the muzzle as he says:

				JESSE
		Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
		in Dreamland now.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
	boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
	stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
	of Erwin and Stormie.

				FREDDY
		Looking for some-body?

	Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
	lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
	Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
	to Erwin:

				STORMIE
		I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
		us up!

	But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

				FREDDY
		Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

	Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
	claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
	Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
	Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
	apron.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Stew on this, bitch!

	Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
	falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

				STORMIE
		Shoot him! Shoot him!

	Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Freddy turns toward Erwin.

				FREDDY
		Well, well, well... if it isn't
		my ol' pal, Erwin.

	Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've got something special in mind
		for you...

	Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
	out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
	his finger.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

				STORMIE
		You didn't help me, you pussy!
		I could've had him!
			(smacks him some more)
		You gutless... spinless... jelly
		fish!

	Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


	INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

	Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
	Lizzy's voice...

				LIZZY
			(V.O.)
		Meagan... help me... Meagan...

	It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
	door.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
	table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
	FREDDY LIVES!

				MEAGAN
		Daddy?

	He looks up and quietly shushes her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

	And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
	newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
	again... upstairs.

	As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
	her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
	looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
	to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
	mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

	Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
	for help draws her to...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
	covers.

				LIZZY
		Help me...

	Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
	pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
	her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
	it's way out.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Meagan...

	Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
	Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
	Meagan in the chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
	Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

				STORMIE
		Are you okay?

	They help Meagan to her feet.

				MEAGAN
			(shaky)
		He got away... I had him and he
		got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
		lost her...

				ERWIN
		Well, atleast you're not dead.

				MEAGAN
		No... I'm not dead...
			(realizes)
		No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

				STORMIE
		He killed me, too. But look...

	Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
	unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
	Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

				MEAGAN
		Now that I think about it -- he's
		killed me in all my nightmares. But
		I'm not dead... what does it mean?

				ERWIN
		It means we've still got some time
		left. Until his remains are host to
		the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
		hurt us.

				JESSE
		Hello. The Dream Demons...?

				ERWIN
		Freddy made a pact with Satan when
		he died... so Satan bestowed upon
		him the Dream Demons. They're the
		source of Freddy's power to manipulate
		our physical reality. Without them...
		he's powerless -- nothing more than
		a bad dream.
			(off Jesse's cynical
				 look)
		Hey, like I said... I don't make
		the rules.

				MEAGAN
		But we've still got a chance, right?
		A chance to kill Freddy before he
		gets back his power?

				ERWIN
		We already tried that. There's no
		way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
		clever. He knows how to get to us.

				MEAGAN
		Then let's get somebody else. Some-
		body strong.

				STORMIE
		Yeah! We could hire somebody to
		kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

				ERWIN
		You would have to hire a thousand
		of them... or one really big guy
		who isn't afraid of anything. No
		fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

				JESSE
		Where are you going to find a hit
		man? The yellow pages? In your
		dreams...

	Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
	bolt and she stammers out a name:

				MEAGAN
		Jason...

				JESSE
		Jason?

				MEAGAN
		Jason Voorhees...

				ERWIN
			(brightens)
		Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
		The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

				STORMIE
		Sounds like our man!

				JESSE
		Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
		isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

				ERWIN
		Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
		Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
		know how to bring him back to life.

				JESSE
		Somehow I just knew you would.

				ERWIN
		But that's not the problem. The
		problem is control. Once we bring
		Jason back from the dead... I'm not
		one hundred percent sure he'll do
		what we tell him.

				STORMIE
		Well, that's okay... as long as he
		doesn't chop us all up.

	Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
		so tell me the truth. Do you think
		if we do this -- if we go and get
		Jason and bring him back to life,
		that he could kill Freddy?

				ERWIN
		No doubt about. Jason could wreck
		Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
		But if Freddy has home court advan-
		tage... I don't know. Too close to
		call. The trick would be to get Jason
		to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
		and drag him out to our reality.

				MEAGAN
		I haven't got a choice. I've got to
		try something...
			(turns to Stormie &
				 Jesse)
		I can't ask either of you to help
		me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
		disgusting...

				STORMIE
		Hey, we sisters have to stand
		together, right? Where you lead --
		I'll follow. Count me in.

	Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
	He looks them over and sighs:

				JESSE
		Let me get this straight... we're
		going to go dig one dead maniac up
		to fight another dead maniac?

				ERWIN
		That's about the size of it... and
		I'd be doing you a disservice if I
		said there weren't a modicum of risk
		involved.

				JESSE
		Meagan... I don't want to do this...

				MEAGAN
		You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
		your fight. I understand.

				JESSE
		But I damn sure don't want you to
		do it without me. Count me in.

	Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
	she pushes him away.

				ERWIN
		Look out Freddy... here we come.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

	In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
	is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
	up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
	the radio.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
		What's matter, girl... you hear
		somethin'?

	Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
	closer.

	The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
	into the darkness when a line of several hearses
	approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
	the driver's window rolls down.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(continuing)
		What's this? A funeral procession?

	A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
	and says:

				CULTIST
		That's exactly what it is.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(suspicious)
		Yeah? Whose?

				CULTIST
		Yours.

	BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
	the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
	a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
	ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

	Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
	the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
	cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
	procession proceeds inside.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

	The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
	cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
	wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
	of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
	charred bones.

	Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
	and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
	around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
	with droopy eyes.

	LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
	the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
	Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
	more surreal as another cult member steps forward
	with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
	the funnel.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
	around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
	blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
	muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

	There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
	Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
	leaps out of the pit and cries:

				FREDDY
		Smokin'!

	Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
	FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
	building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
	them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
	reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		We're almost there...

				MEAGAN
			(V.O.)
		We should pull over and ask
		directions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		If it doesn't offend the men...
		ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Very funny.


	EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
	station.

				STORMIE
		I don't think they're open.

				MEAGAN
		It says, open all night.

	Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

				JESSE
		Hey! Can we get some service out
		here?!

				STORMIE
		I don't think there's anybody
		here...

	Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
	side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you kids want?

				MEAGAN
		We're looking for the old cemetery
		that's supposed to be around here...
		somewhere.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you want to know for?

				STORMIE
		We want to see it.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
		'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

				JESSE
		Look, mister... can you give us
		directions or not?

	The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
	over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
	Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
	under a baseball cap.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		You're not goin' up there to do
		somethin' stupid, are you?

				JESSE
			(laughs; nervous)
		Stupid? Like what?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
		that's what!

	Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
	busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
	their heads innocently in a big performance that
	wouldn't fool a stick.

				JESSE
			(looks at Meagan)
		Jesus... why would anyone do that?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		I dunno... but people do.

				STORMIE
		Been dug up a few times already,
		has he?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		More times than I care to remember.

				MEAGAN
		Well, we're just doing an article
		for our high school newspaper about
		the dangers of breaking into
		cemeteries at night. You know,
		stuff that can get you hurt...

	The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
	acquiesces.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well... okay... as long as you're
		not going up there to do something
		stupid.
			(pointing)
		Take this road up about a mile and
		make a left at the ol' saw mill.
		That road will take you right on
		in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
		can't miss it.

	Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
	ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
	PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
	WILL BE SHOT!

	Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
	cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
	shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
	Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		What's the story on Jason Voorhees
		anyway?

				STORMIE
		Where have you been? Jason was that
		guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
		chopping up camp counselors, duh?

				MEAGAN
		I knew that. What I mean was why?

				ERWIN
		It started a long time ago, back in
		the fifties, when Jason drown at
		Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
		berserk and started killing the
		counselors.

				STORMIE
		She got her head chopped off by one
		of the girls she was trying to kill!

				ERWIN
		Right. And then Jason came back from
		his watery grave to get revenge.

				JESSE
		He came back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
		before they finally caught up to him.

				MEAGAN
		What happened to him then?

				ERWIN
		They killed him.

				JESSE
		How can you kill somebody who's
		back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Not very well apparently. Jason
		keeps coming back to life and
		chopping people up. It's a never
		ending cycle of terror up here at
		Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

				MEAGAN
		Why does he keep coming back to
		life and killing people?

				ERWIN
		They say he's looking for revenge
		on the camp counselor who murdered
		him as a child. Jason just happens
		to go about it in the socially
		unacceptable way of hacking through
		every teenager he finds until he
		gets the right one.
			(spots grave)
		Here it is...

	Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

	ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
	Died:1953.

	Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
	stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

	Jesse and Erwin start digging.

	ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
	Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
	hits something solid.

	Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
	coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
	jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

	The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
	noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
	and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

	Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

	Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
	their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
	the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
	shirt, and calmly eats it.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
	holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
	hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
	tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
	taking anymore chances with bugs.

	Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
	at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
	-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
	mask.

					CUT TO:

	The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
	Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
	the lid closed.

	Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

	In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
	Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
	Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
	and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

				ERWIN
		Look... the boogerman!
			(laughs)
		Get it?!

	Stormie slaps his hand away.

				STORMIE
		Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
		Ug! I thought I had seen the last
		of those when my brother graduated
		third grade!

				ERWIN
		We just dug up a rotting corpse and
		you're worried about a little snot.

	Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
	beside him.  She purrs:

				MEAGAN
		I'm exhausted... wake me when we
		get back home.

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
		we've still got a lot of work to
		do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

	This news sobers everyone up immediately.

				STORMIE
		Well, that means we've all got to
		stay awake!

				JESSE
		Duh?!

				MEAGAN
		I know! We'll sing a song!
			(starts singing)
		Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
		the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream. Come
		on, everybody!

	Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
	chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
	the night.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
	to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

				MEAGAN
		...merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream.

	In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
	breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

	Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
	drooping.  The car starts to weave.

	ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
	a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
	FOR FOOD.

	Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
	on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

	Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
	board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
	out of the driver's window.

	CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
	ground, the red digits cascading up.

	Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
	the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
	his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

				FREDDY
		Shouldn't dream and drive.

	Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
	out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
	it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
	belching HELLFIRE.

	ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
	close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
	maremobile closing from behind fast.

	The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
	car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
	of the dozen of levers on the dash.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
	of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
	of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
	the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
	trunk lid opens.

	ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
	remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
	the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
	of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
	of the bag.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Looks like the cat's out of the
		bag now!

	Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

	The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
	car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
	all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
	startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
	nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

				MEAGAN
		It's Freddy!

	WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
	as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
	dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
	maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
	A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

	Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
	the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
	back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
	seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
	EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
	their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
	boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
	the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
	under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

	As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
	she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
	her legs.  Meagan screams.

	Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
	forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
	SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
	to swerve violently from side to side.

	Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

	CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
	up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
	into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
	Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
	CUTTING forward towards...

	CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
	it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
	road, veering into a tree line.

	CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
	the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

	Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
	overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
	EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

	In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
	on inside.

	The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
	ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
	door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
	embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
	around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
	is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
	Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
	Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
		to get him to a doctor.

	Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
	the farmer on the phone.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry... an ambulance is on
		the way.

	Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

				MEAGAN
		Oh, God... Jesse...

	Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
	garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
	untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

				ERWIN
		Meagan... listen to me... The cops
		are on their way. If they find me
		and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
		there, we're finished.

				MEAGAN
		Go... get out of here. Take Jason
		and Stormie with you.

				STORMIE
		I'm staying with you.

	Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

				ERWIN
		I'll call you at the hospital.

				STORMIE
		How?

				ERWIN
		Somehow!

	Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
	into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
	growing close.

					CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
	special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
	doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
	finishes, Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		Is he going to be okay?

				DOCTOR
		Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
		His leg is broken in four places
		and he has four broken ribs and a
		concussion.

	Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
	Stormie turns to the doctor.

				STORMIE
		Hey doc, is there someplace I
		could get us something to eat?

				DOCTOR
		I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
		There are some vending machines in
		the lobby.
			(to Meagan)
		I'll be back to check on him in a
		couple of hours.

	The doctor exits.

				STORMIE
		I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
		score us some munchies.

	Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
	head on Jesse's hand.


	INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
	the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
	at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
	and Erwin.

	Stormie dashes for the staircase.


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
	monitor BEEPS...

	On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
	peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
	ducks back down.

	Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
	and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

	Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
	onto the curtain.

	CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
	the rings.

	Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
	away.

	Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
	again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
	are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
	of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
	the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
	mattress.


	INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
	she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
	along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
	them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
	out into...


	EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
	in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
	and gunbelt.

	Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
	fear... staring at something coming down the street.

	It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

				FREDDY
			(ala John Wayne)
		Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
		ain't big enough for the two of
		us... draw!

	Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
	He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
	FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
	and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
	and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

	Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

				FREDDY
		Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
		you just go get [BEEP]


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
	wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


	INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

	Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
	empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
	gun you ever saw and says:

				FREDDY
		Go ahead... make my dream!

	Freddy FIRES!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
	Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
	flat line.  Jesse is dead.

	A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
	Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
	and screams.

	Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
	gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy killed Jesse...

	Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
	of the room.


	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
	the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

				STORMIE
		Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
		think a nurse in a hospital would
		have seen a dead body before.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse...

	Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
	off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
	come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
	Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
	and company go thundering past.

	Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
		please pick up the white paging
		phone for a message?

	Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
	announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
	Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
	and picks up the white paging phone.

				STORMIE
			(into phone)
		This is Stormie...

	Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
	station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
	Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

				MURDOCH
		Did you see a couple of girls go
		by here a moment ago?

	Stormie gestures to the elevators.

				STORMIE
		Just missed 'em.

	Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
	men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
	relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

				HOSPITAL OPERATOR
			(filtered)
		The message is from Erwin... he
		says to meet him at the side
		entrance in two minutes.

	Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
	staircase.


	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
	Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
	He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
	inside, climbing in after her and asking:

				STORMIE
		Where'd you get the truck?

				ERWIN
		Same place I've got Jason hid.

				STORMIE
		And where's that?

				ERWIN
		A place where no one ever goes.

	Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
	out of the parking lot.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
	worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
	past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
	short distance away from the pier and the three of
	them climb out.

	Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
	as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
	platform tied up to the end.

				STORMIE
		What'd you do -- take him for a
		swim?

				ERWIN
		Almost.

	Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
	a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
	down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
	pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
	Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
	asks:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Is she going to be alright?

				STORMIE
		I don't know. She's pretty fucked
		up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

				ERWIN
		You're a strong woman.

				STORMIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
		anything.

	Stormie gestures to the tarp.

				STORMIE
		Is this him?

				ERWIN
		Yeah...
			(whips back tarp)
		Meet the new and improved Jason.

	ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
	platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
	coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
	done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
	barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
	been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
	mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
	bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

				STORMIE
		Why'd you put that stupid mask
		on him?

				ERWIN
		Take a look...

	Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
	and quickly replaces it.

				STORMIE
		Good idea.

				ERWIN
		Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
		is he?

				STORMIE
		So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
		Osbourne song backwards or something?

				ERWIN
		I'm afraid it's not that simple...

				STORMIE
		I thought you said you knew how to
		bring him back to life?

				ERWIN
		I do! But when I was putting him
		back together, I noticed something
		was missing.

	Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

				STORMIE
		Awwww, he won't be needing that...
		I mean, what girl would let him
		put his rotten ol'...

				ERWIN
			(cuts her off)
		No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
		it's missing.

				STORMIE
		Well... does it really matter?
		Can't you use an aquarium pump or
		something?

				ERWIN
		No... he has to have a heart. A
		human heart. A good one.

	Meagan speaks for the first time:

				MEAGAN
		I know where we can get a heart...
		A good one.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
	a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
	Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
	parked a safe distance away.

				ERWIN
		That guard in there might pose a
		problem.

				MEAGAN
		Do you think you and Stormie could
		keep him occupied for a few minutes?

	Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
	not?

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Okay... let's do it.

	A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
	up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
	and goes to the glass door, peering out.

	ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
	making out -- hot and heavy.


	INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

	Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
	crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
	to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
	dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
	full of organs, etc.

	Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
	one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
	ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
	Even worse.

	Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
	to quiver as she caresses his face.


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
	in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
	He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
	better look.

	Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

				STORMIE
		Hey! Watch that!

				ERWIN
		I'm just trying to make it look real.

				STORMIE
		Just keep your hands above the bra,
		pizza face.

	The windows are starting to steam up.


	INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

	Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
	gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
	ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
	knife.

	Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
	sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
	far above her head.

				MEAGAN
		Forgive me, Jesse...

	Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
	sickening THWACK!


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
	obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
	deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
	the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
	They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
	another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
	parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
	his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

	Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
	shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
	guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
	the morgue.

				STORMIE
		He's head right for her! Do some-
		thing!

	Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


	INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
	chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
	fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
	then starts pulling harder.

	In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
	and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
	the HORN stops.

	Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
	to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
	tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

	The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
	drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
	unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
	two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
	and kicks the door.

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
	inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
	He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
	of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
	a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
	a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
	cabinet...

	Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
	and cries:

				GUARD
		Stop right there!

	Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
	The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
	curses and races for the...


	EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

	The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
	close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
	shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
	guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
	that the door has closed and locked behind him.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
	cemetery.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		They said they were writin' for
		some newspaper...

				MURDOCH
		Teenagers are notorious liars.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well, after I heard about the
		accident on my police scanner, I
		came up here to have a look. When
		I found it I figured you'd want to
		know right away.

				MURDOCH
		You did the right thing.

	The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
	grave.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Damn kids... I just knew they were
		comin' up here to do somethin'
		stupid.

	The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Just got a call on the radio --
		three juveniles just broke into the
		morgue -- one male, two female. The
		guard is pretty sure the male is in
		the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Sounds like the same kids I saw.

				MURDOCH
		Did the guard say what they took?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
		they carved his heart out.
			(beat)
		They got away in a pick-up -- the
		guard didn't get the license. You
		want me to put out an A.P.B.?

				MURDOCH
		No... that won't be necessary. I
		know just where they're going, and
		just what they're up to. And this
		time... I'll be ready.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
	as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
	dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
	her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
	her and says:

				STORMIE
		You've got to quit blaming your-
		self for what happened to Jesse...
		it wasn't your fault.

				MEAGAN
		He didn't want to come with us...
		but he did anyway. He did it for me.

				STORMIE
		I'm not sorry I came... I don't
		think Jesse would be, either.

				MEAGAN
		I just can't believe he's dead. I
		keep thinking he'll show up any
		minute...

				ERWIN
		Well, that just about does it...

	Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
	the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
	it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
	Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
	them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
	from the water's edge.

	In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
	cable.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		As you can see, I've excavated the
		power cable that runs across the
		bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
		away the insulation, exposing a
		patch of cable right near the water's
		edge.

	Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
	at the head of the trench.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Now when I kick this over, the water
		will wash down the trench and bridge
		an eletrical gap between the cable
		and the lake. There's plenty of
		voltage, so it should work.

				STORMIE
		So you kick the bucket and Jason
		lives.

				ERWIN
		Yeah, right...
			(then)
		Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

	Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
	the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
	A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
	glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
	girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
	engulfing the diving platform.

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
	onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

	CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
	spirals down into the eye hole like water running
	down a drain.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
	eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

					OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

	EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

	CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
	reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
	pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
	beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

	JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
	down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
	rye. He bellows:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Jason! Git your ass over here!

	Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
	slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
	several paces away.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		What did I teach you, boy? Don't
		ever take your mask off out in
		public. I don't want nobody to see
		that ugly mug of yours.

	Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
	smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
	woodshed.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Go git in the woodshed.

	Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
	knows what's coming next.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Drop them overalls and lay over
		them logs...

	Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
	Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
	calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Jason! Come here!

	Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
	towards his mother.

				JASON'S FATHER
		What are you doing woman?

	Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
	dollars and change.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I saved up some money... I want
		you to take and go on up to that
		summer camp just up the road. Tell
		the man you want to stay there.

				JASON'S FATHER
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing, bitch?!

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

				JASON'S FATHER
		You ain't sending him nowhere.
			(to Jason)
		Bring me that money, boy!

	Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
	obey, when his mother shoos him away.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Go on now... go!

	Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
		the shed, woman!

	Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		You ain't ever taking anyone to
		the shed ever again.

	Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
	back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
	Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
	coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
	arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
	view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
	way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
	him, calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		Go on, son... have a good time!
		Mommy will come and git you some
		day soon!

	Jason turns and runs to...


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
	to the camp with his jar of money.

	In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
	and shakes his hand.

				HEAD COUNSELOR
		Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
		you'll have a great time!

					CUT TO:

	The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
	laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
	breaks away, running towards the pier.

	Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
	reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
	distortions in the water make his face look normal.

	Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
	aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
	appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
	he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

	Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
	stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
	water.

	JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
	whoever is holding him under.

	Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
	the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
	him before he dies.

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
	the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
	shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

				ERWIN
		Holy shit! It worked!

	Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
	is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
	to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

				MEAGAN
		It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
		it off!

				ERWIN
		Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
		to me that I hadn't really planned
		for that contingency.

				STORMIE
		Just don't stand there! Do something!

	But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
	rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
		Do you hear me? Get up!

	Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
	against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
	rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

	A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
	and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
	electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
	smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
	Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

				ERWIN
		Well... it's off now.

	Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
	shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
	between them, offering quick excuses and humble
	apologies.

	All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
	never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
	the lake.

	Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
	after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
	gait.

	Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
	dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
	out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
	and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
	and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
	then calls to the girls:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
		up in the tool shed!

	Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
	through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
	girl and runs away.


	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
	spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

				MEAGAN
		Who are you calling?!

				STORMIE
		The cops! Who else?!

				MEAGAN
		Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
		up and throw away the key!

				STORMIE
		Fine by me!
			(clicks the receiver)
		Damnit! It's dead!

	Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
	the door shut behind him.

				ERWIN
		He's right behind me!

	Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
	Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

				STORMIE
			(to Erwin)
		You're the one who brought him
		back to life!

				ERWIN
		And?!

				STORMIE
		Well, do something!

	Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
	Stormie clucks:

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, some hero!

	Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
	Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
	closet, closing themselves inside.

	They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
	moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
	breathing.

	Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
	closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
	out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

	Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
	up in front of him and yells:

				MEAGAN
		STOP!

	To everyone's shock... Jason does.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now... just stop! We're the ones
		that brought you back to life.
		And you have no right to kill us
		with that chainsaw! In fact... you
		owe us...

				STORMIE
		That's right! She gave you her
		boyfriend's heart, you know!

				MEAGAN
		That's right.

	Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Look! Here's his picture...

	Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
	opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
	inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
	in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
	Jesse with a meaty finger.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now, I know that you've been through
		a lot. And I know that you're pissed
		off about being murdered and all.

				STORMIE
			(interjects)
		I know I would be!

				MEAGAN
		But if you help us kill Freddy
		Krueger... I promise to help you
		find the little bastard that
		killed you. What do you say? Have
		we got a deal?

	Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
	it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
	he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

	Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
	windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
	get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
	the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

	ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
	lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
	weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
	force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		You in there! This is Captain Renton
		Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
		ordering you to come out with your
		hands up! I'll give you until the
		count of three...
			(beat)
		Three!

	Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
	closet.

				MEAGAN
			(whispering)
		Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
		here and don't come out until we
		tell you. Stormie... help me!

	Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
	closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
	their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
	raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
	the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
	in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
	searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright... anybody else left in
		there had better say their prayers!

				ERWIN
		There's no one else inside.

				MURDOCH
		Is that a fact?
			(into bullhorn)
		Okay... you had your chance!

	Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
	and shouts:

				COP
		Hey, look!

	All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
	massive frame is filling the doorway.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Holy Mary, mother of God... would
		you look at the size of that guy?

				MURDOCH
			(almost happy)
		I knew it!

	All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
	suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
	behind him.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Stand back! I'll handle this.

	Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		You...

	Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
	Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
	a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

	A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
	down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
	up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing;
				 into radio)
		Let her go.


	EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
	laser-guided napalm bomb.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

	A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
	Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

	SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
	in on the laser dot on his chest.

	BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
	All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
	Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
	as he embraces the terrible sight.

				MURDOCH
		That'll teach you to fuck with the
		law, Voorhees!

	A cop behind him says:

				COP
		Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

	Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
	is burning above the brim.

	Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
	flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
	a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
	Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
	worrisome looks through the windows just before the
	cars pull away.

	As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
	something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
	form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
	onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

				CURIOUS COP
		Hey... do you see that?

	But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
	pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
	looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

				PARTNER
		See what?

				CURIOUS COP
		I thought I saw something...

	He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

	Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
	sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
	car and driving away.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

	A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
	door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
	behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
	female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
	her desk.

	Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
	watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
	begins to devour three combo-burritos.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to try and stay awake.

				STORMIE
		Getting something to eat might help.
			(calls to Deputy)
		Yo, Butch!

				DEPUTY MILLER
		It's Deputy Miller.

				STORMIE
		Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
		we have something to eat?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		I thought you psychos only ate
		human hearts?

				STORMIE
		And I thought you pigs only ate
		donuts.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Don't make me come back there.

				STORMIE
			(low; to Meagan)
		Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
		combo-burrito cud!

	Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
	the floor in defeat.

				MEAGAN
		What am I going to do? I'll never
		be able to find Lizzy now.

				STORMIE
		You should be worrying about your-
		self... I know I am.

	Stormie plops down on her cot.

				MEAGAN
		I bet you're sorry you came with
		me now...

				STORMIE
		Nah... what are best friends for?
		Afterall, you stuck by me through
		all my crazy phases, I figure I
		owe you one big crazy phase, right?

				MEAGAN
		That's for being my best friend,
		Stormie.

	Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
	cell, unlocking it.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Come on, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		Where are we going?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Your parents are here.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
	where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
	Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
		Let me look at you...

				MEAGAN
		I'm okay, mom.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mother's been worried sick,
		Meagan. So have I.

	Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
	bloody and soiled.

				MEAGAN
		Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
	that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
	passes behind her.

	The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
	a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
	raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
	stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

	Stormie is fast asleep.

	Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
	the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
	jumps to her feet and screams.

				STORMIE
		Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

	But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
	respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
	licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
	forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
	pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
	self asleep.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

	She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

				FREDDY
		You know what they say... when you
		sleep -- you die!

	Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
		you helped one of those cultists
		escape from a hospital?

				MEAGAN
		A mental hospital.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And he said you desecrated a cemetery
		and some other really terrible things.
		Tell me you had nothing to do with
		it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

				MEAGAN
		There's no mistake.
			(to Murdoch)
		What did you do with Erwin?

				MURDOCH
		Your boyfriend is headed back to the
		looney bin where he belongs. But
		don't worry, you'll be seeing him
		soon enough... at the arraignment.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
	by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
	Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

				STORMIE
		You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
		to my various phases and many hours
		of watching violent televison, I
		have become immune to violence. Seen
		it all and done it all! Nothing you
		do can gross me out -- so why don't
		you give it your best shot, bitch!

				FREDDY
		Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

	Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
	defensive stance.

				STORMIE
		I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
		is a drill sergeant in the Marine
		Corps and he taught me just how to
		defend myself against slimy bastards
		like you.

				FREDDY
		Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
		Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
		I dare you!

	Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
	take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
	right in the nose.

				FREDDY
			(continuing;
				 surprised)
		Owwwww!

	Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
	fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
	breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
	She screams.

	Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
	up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
	Freddy smiles.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Now that's what I call getting a
		buzz.


	INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

	Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
	of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
	the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
	those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
	boogers.

	Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
	rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
	distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

				BOOGERMAN
		Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
		heh... get it?

	Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
	to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
		Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
		I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

	Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
	tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
	screams again.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

	Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

				MEAGAN
		We're wasting time! We've got to
		close down all the churches --
		Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
		ground!

	Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
	frightened looks.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Don't you understand?! He has to
		come to our reality to do it! It's
		our last chance to kill him!

				MURDOCH
		Okay, I think we've heard enough of
		this crap. Take her back to the
		lockup.

	A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
	and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
	watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
	daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

				MEAGAN
		Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
		I have to save Lizzy!

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
		even realize what you've done.

				MEAGAN
		I did what I had to do to try and
		save Lizzy!

				MURDOCH
		Yeah, including murdering your boy-
		friend and cutting his heart out.

				MEAGAN
		Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
		already dead when I cut his heart
		out!

	Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing; manic)
		Goddamnit, you don't understand!
		Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

	Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
	the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

				MURDOCH
		I know how you must feel... I had
		a dog once. I loved that dog. I
		treated her like my own daughter.
		We went camping, picnics in the
		park... I even had a little stocking
		for her nailed up on the mantle for
		Christmas. Then one day, she bit
		me... so I had to blow her brains
		out.
			(sighs)
		God, I loved that dog.


	INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

	Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
	knife.

	A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
	cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

				BOOGERMAN
		Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
		again -- gotta go!

	Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
	nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
	blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
	possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
	She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
	ahead.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Well, excuse me!

	INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
	his head.

	The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
	him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
	front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
	pulled out, kicking and screaming.

	Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
	closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
	twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
	man across the cell.

	Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
	ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
	flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
	his nasty head still alive in the center.

	Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
	extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
	the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
	he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
	Stormie's cell.

	Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
	right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
	of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
	clings to life deep inside the nostril.

	Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
	up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

				FREDDY
		Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

	Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
	with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
	cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
	screaming her head off.

	Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
	screams too.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

	As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
	hear a loud SPLAT!

				MEAGAN
		Stormie?!

	The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
	cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
	cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
	runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
	splattered with blood and bits.

	Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
	come running into the cellblock, answering the
	deputy's puke-choked scream.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Oh, God... what have I done? What
		have I done?!

	We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
	lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
	gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
	chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
	suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
	The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
	with a terrible SQUEAL.

	WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
	it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
	attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
	Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

				AMBULANCE DRIVER
		I'll go check it out. You stay here.

	The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
	road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
	carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
	the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
	it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
	He starts towards the ambulance.

	The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
	emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
	slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
	grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
	pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
	into the side of the ambulance.

	In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
	watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
	a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
	silence.

	RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
	and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
	weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
	eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

	Then... nothing.

	After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
	over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
	-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
	to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

				ERWIN
		You... want me to tell you where
		Meagan is?

	Again with the thrusting.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
		for a minute there I thought you
		were going to kill me.
			(then)
		You're not, are you?

	Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... okay! I'll take you right
		to her. Could you help me out of
		this?

	Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

	Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
	behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		I'll drive.

	Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
	the passenger side door.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... you drive.

	As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
	off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Fasten your safety belt, please.

	Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
	safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
	Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
	The CHIME goes crazy.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			(continuing)
		Fasten your safety belt, please...
		Fasten your safety belt, please...

	Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
	the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
	to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

				ERWIN
		Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

	With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
	ambulance roars away into the early morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

	Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
	as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
	to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
	she switches on the cellblock TV.

	ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
	is on.

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
		-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
		And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
		Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

	A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
	studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Good morning, friends... the Good
		Book says that each morning brings
		a new light into our lives...

	The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
	before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
	answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
	-- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
	commercial comes on:

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		You can own a videotape of Reverend
		Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
		$19.95...

					  CUT TO:

	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

	In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
	as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
	hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

				GATE GUARD
		Hello. What can I do for you?

	A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

				CULTIST
		We're here to see the Reverend
		Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
		wedding.

				GATE GUARD
		Do you have an appointment?

				CULTIST
		No. I have a Beretta.

	The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


	INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

	The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
	organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
	The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

	BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
	OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
	Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
	wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

	The cultists break into the control room, killing the
	DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
	garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
	Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
	All the feed monitors go snowy.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
	the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

				MEAGAN
		Something just happened at the TV
		station.

				DEPUTY
		Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

				MEAGAN
		What for?

				DEPUTY
		Time to get you cleaned up for court.

	Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
	get undressed.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
	a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
	are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
	skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
	dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
	side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
	shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
	catcall.

	Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
	to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
	over to Meagan and says:

				HEAD BITCH
		What's the matter, honey... you
		don't like our company?

				MEAGAN
		I like you... sure. It's just that
		I usually shower alone, that's all.

				HEAD BITCH
		Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
		they're shy...

	The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
	bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
	as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Don't fight it, baby! You know you
		want me...

	Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
	off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
	spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
	produces a shiv.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		If you won't give me a piece then
		I'll just cut one for myself...

	The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
	step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
	holds up her hands.

				MEAGAN
		Wait a second... I didn't mean to
		do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
		you come on a little strong, that's
		all. Just give me a little time to
		adjust to my new surroundings...

	The head bitch stops, curious.

				HEAD BITCH
		Are you saying you want me now?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I want you.

				HEAD BITCH
		Prove it.

	Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
	flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
	-- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
	the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
	long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
	bitch smiles.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Now that's more like it!
			(to the others)
		Hey, this bitch is alright!

	The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
	arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		You're okay, honey... what's your
		name?

				MEAGAN
		Meagan.

				HEAD BITCH
		So... what're you in for, Meagan?

				MEAGAN
			(sniffles a little)
		Oh, my friend...

				HEAD BITCH
		The bitch that died last night?

				MEAGAN
			(starts to cry)
		Yeah... they said she had some
		disease that made her... explode!
		Oh, God! Please hold me!

	The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
	smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
	of concern as one asks:

				BITCH #1
		What's this bullshit about some
		killer funk make you explode?

				HEAD BITCH
			(to Meagan)
		Easy... honey. It's goin' be
		alright. But what I asked you is
		why you're in here?

				MEAGAN
		Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
		think I gave it to her...

	The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
	were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
	but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
	the bitches race for the exit.

	The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
	shouts:

				DEPUTY
		What the hell is all the screaming
		about?!

	WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
	from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
	running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
	After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
	drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

	The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
	through the station.  Several deputies chase after
	them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
	ensues.  Chaos.

	Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
	up at the madness and mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks...


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
	on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
	The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
	head with her baton and she falls to the side,
	revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
	uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

	The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
	sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
	her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
	leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
	face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

	On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
	charging into the showers to restore order.  She
	gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
	to freedom.


	EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
	up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
	pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
	and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

				JUNIOR TROOPER
		Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

					 CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
	shakes his head, saying:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		I won't do it! It's a sin!
		Blasphemy!

	One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

				CULTIST
		Wedding or funeral... your choice.

	The reverend swallows and says:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And who would be the bride?

	Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
	and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
	lulls around as she chants softly:

				LIZZY
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
	needle from one to another.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Three... four... Better lock your
		door.

	The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
	throat.  He shudders and asks:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And the groom.

				CULTIST
		He's coming...

	Lizzy is almost asleep.

				LIZZY
		Five... six... grab your crucifix...

	The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
	Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
	falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
	an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
	the curtains on FIRE.

	As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
	appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
	leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
	to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

				FREDDY
		That's for the lift sister!
			(to the cultists)
		Hiya, kids!

				CULTISTS
			(in unison)
		Hiya, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Ready to get hitched?

				CULTISTS
		Ready, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Then let's do it!

	Lizzy looks up and smiles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Freddy...

					  CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

	A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

				DEPUTY
		We found your patrol car, Captain.
		It was abandoned near a local
		religious station.

				MURDOCH
		Religious station? Is there a
		padre there?

				DEPUTY
		Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
		casts out of that location.

				MURDOCH
		So that's where they're hiding.

					  CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		...and if there be anyone among you
		who has any reason why these two
		should not be joined in holy...

	Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
			(continuing)
		...in matrimony. Let them speak
		now...
			(under his breath)
		...please God...
			(aloud)
		...or forever hold their peace.

	WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

				MEAGAN
		Stop!

	Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing;
				 to Freddy)
		Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

				FREDDY
		You're a virgin?!

				MEAGAN
		Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

	Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
	around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

				FREDDY
		Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
		than your retard sister... okay,
		you've got the job.
			(to cultists)
		Get her ready.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

	Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
	station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
	the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
	out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
	and says:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
		State Trooper. I'm giving you until
		the count of three to come out with
		your hands up...

	A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
	hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
	other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
	calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Hand me that flare pistol.

	The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Good idea. Throw a little light on
		them -- see if we can spot their
		firing positions...

	As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
	carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
	to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
	He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
	screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
	commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright, now I'm through playing
		"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
		you punks to come out right now
		with your hands up.

	The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
	-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
	and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
	EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

	The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
	dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
	beside Freddy.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

	As the battle outside between the cultists and the
	cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
	down behind a fender to reload.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Well, it doesn't look like they're
		going to surrender.

				MURDOCH
		What we're going to need then is
		somebody to charge their lines --
		make a hole for us to slip in.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Where are you going to find anyone
		that crazy?

	Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
	police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

				MURDOCH
		Here comes one now...
			(yells)
		GO GIT 'EM, SON!

	Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
	Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
	side window as the ambulance zooms past.

	Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
	the ambulance.

	The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
	SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
	through the front gate.

	Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
	the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

				ERWIN
		That was easy enough...

	Erwin looks ahead and screams.

	ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
	directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
	machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
	ducks down.

	Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
	ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
	into the side of the station with a CRASH.

	Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
	cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
	smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
	machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
	the cultist just in time.

	As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
	greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
	OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
	punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
	Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
	Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
	towards the front door.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The wedding proceeds...

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Once again... if there be anyone
		among you who does not want these
		two people to be joined... let him
		speak now or forever hold his peace.

	Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
	reverend clears his throat to continue when...

	WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
	in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

				FREDDY
		Uh, oh...

	The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
	one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
	a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
	idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
	machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
	as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
	on the other side start POUNDING.

	Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
	slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
	it falls to the floor.

	Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
	behind him.

	Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
	wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
	looks up and says:

				ERWIN
		I can't wake them up. Freddy's
		got them trapped!

	Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
	couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
	Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
	of dream dope.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Go get him, boy!

	Jason staggers forward, falling into...


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
	entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
	head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
	the LIVING DEAD.

	Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
	shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

	Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
	boxing gloves.

	TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

				TED BUNDY
			(into microphone)
		Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
		to the fight of the century! I'm
		your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

	BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
	BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
	and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
	back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
	calls into the balcony:

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

	ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
	smoking.

				OSWALD
			(angry; defensive)
		It wasn't me!

	Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

				TED BUNDY
		In my left corner, weighing in at
		only ninety seven pounds... the
		nightmare master himself! The one!
		The only... Freddddddddy
		Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

	Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And on my right... weighing in at
		a whopping four hundred and thir-
		teen pounds... that killer of
		countless teenagers... the big
		guy...
			(gestures to Jason)
		Jason Voorhees!

	CHEERS and BOOS.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And the prize tonight... not one but
		TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
		ripe for the picking.

	Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
	Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Hey, have one now and save the other
		for the ride home. That's what I did.

	LAUGHTER from the crowd.

				MEAGAN
		Kick his ass, Jason!

	DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

	Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
	blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
	glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
	RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

	Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
	axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
	over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
	her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

				BLOODY MARY
		HEY!

	Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
	OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
	down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
	and shrugs:

				FREDDY
		Oh, well... I just axed for that!

	Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
	Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
	axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
	between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
	turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

				HITLER
		Peasants...

	DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
	into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
	his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
	starts in:

				HUMAN HEAD
		That's it, kiddo! You're really
		giving it to him out there! Use the
		left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
		That's the ticket to a knockout!

	Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
	the studio door.


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

	DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
	Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
	each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
	Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
	a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
	OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
	CHEERS.

	Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
	opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
	decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
	of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

	Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
	disgust.

	Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
	high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
	to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

	Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
	Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
	can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
	opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
	and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
	his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
	chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
	heavy metal boxing glove.

	Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
	massive glove for a blow.

	CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
	glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
	He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

	As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
	around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
	into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
	see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
	Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

	>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! Get up! Get up!

	ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
	water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
	up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
	wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

	Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
	Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
	the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jason! You've got to get up!

	JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
	him down... drowning him...

						  FLASH CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
	to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

	Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
	his killer comes into sharp focus.

	It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
	reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
	Jason down again, laughing.

						  HARD CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

	Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
	mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
	of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
	mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
	him up with him.

	Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
	ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


	INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
	he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
	the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
	pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
	real world.

				FREDDY
		Oh, shit!

	Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
	boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
	tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

	Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
	They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
	suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
	-- dead.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

	The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
	police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
	heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
	sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

				MURDOCH
		Now's my chance... give me sixty
		seconds to get in there then move
		in.

	Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
	running into the station.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
	and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

				MEAGAN
		What took you so long?!

	Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
	so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

				ERWIN
		What ever you do... don't let this
		guy drive.

	Meagan smiles at Jason.

				MEAGAN
		I knew you would come...

	Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
	fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
	scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

	The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
	then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
	disappear.

	In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
	monitor, laughing.

				ERWIN
		Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

	Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
	from the control room via a long thick cable running
	overhead.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		He's going for the satellite dish!
		If he uplinks with a communications
		satellite he can beam himself any-
		where in the world! We'll never be
		rid of him!

	Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
	past them, going through the ceiling to the...


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
	to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
	ready to beam Freddy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
	hard.


	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
	BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


	EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

	The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
	off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
	tumbling into deep space.

	The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

	Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
	and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
	skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
	One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

	ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
	solar prominence.


	INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
	a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
	dust billows up.

	Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
	Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
	this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

				ERWIN
		No! Wait!

	Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
	the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
	run to his side.

	Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
	chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
	out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin? Erwin?!

				MURDOCH
		He's dead... and so are you if you
		don't put your hands up right now!

	Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
	the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
	as he says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		It's time I taught you girls some
		respect for the law!

	In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
	cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

	PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
	SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
	large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
	turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		So... you wanna be a punk?

	Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Then die like a punk!

	Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
	hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
	jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
	pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
	with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
	see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

	As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
	hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
	of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
	muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
	the shotgun and...

	BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
	his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
	of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
	metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
	spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

	Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
	floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
	come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
	guns in panic.

				MEAGAN
		NO!

	Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
	FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
	grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
	past.

	More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
	start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
	is crowded with muzzle flash.

	More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
	hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

	The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
	up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

	VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
	opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
	passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
	cops in the studio.

	Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
	off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
	to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
	of his chest and head.

	Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
	SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
	the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
	gunsmoke in the room.

	As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
	then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

	Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
	reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
	pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

	Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
	rolls back -- he's dead.

	Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
	revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
	Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
	turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

				LIZZY
		You forgot to check under the bed.

	Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
	-- nada.

				MEAGAN
		No monsters here.

				LIZZY
		But what if they come back?

				MEAGAN
		Then we'll just have to kick their
		ass again.

	Lizzy giggles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		I love you too. Go to sleep.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
	to her from the bottom of the staircase.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Meagan?

	Meagan looks down at her parents.

				MEAGAN
		Yes, dad?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mom and I... well, we want to
		thank you for saving your sister's
		life... we know you went through
		a lot.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're going to be there for you
		from now on... for both of you!
		And that nice lawyer we hired for
		you said he thinks he can get all
		the charges dropped... except maybe
		for the grave robbing and human
		desecration ones.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Everything is going to be fine.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And I'm going to get sober...

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		We're going to be a normal, happy
		family again.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

				MEAGAN
		Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Goodnight, Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
	when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

				MEAGAN
		Hello?

				FREDDY
			(filtered)
		I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

	Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
	licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
	phone down.

				MEAGAN
			(sighs)
		I know...

	Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
	climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
	the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
	and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

					 BLACKNESS:

	The phone RINGS.

	ROLL END CREDITS:

	Then... at the very end...

					 CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

	Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
	the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
	when they went back to reality... waiting.

	Finally, somebody says:

				MONSTER
		I don't think they're coming back.

				TED BUNDY
		Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
		body can go home now.

	All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

	BLACK... now it's over.

				THE END
NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

				by Lewis Abernathy


	FADE IN:

	EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

	MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
	Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
	The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(in chorus)
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
	lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
	Elm Street 1 & 2).

	Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
	house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
	children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
	and jumprope on the front walk.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Three... four... better lock your
		door.

	Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
	"4" drawn on concrete.

	Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
	from Nightmare 3 & 4).

	Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
	little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
	peeling away.

	Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
	it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
	porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Five... six...

	RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

	The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
	we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
	find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
	nighttime.

	The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
	stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
	back to the little girl.

	But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
	remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
	and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
	it into the...


	INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
	cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
	Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
	tries to open it -- locked.

	Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
	trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
	GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy?

	Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
	following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
	belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
	end of the hallway, moving into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

	On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
	old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
	draws with crayons.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy. What are you doing here?

				LIZZY
		Playing with my friend.

	Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
	of Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		Your friend?

				LIZZY
		He lives under the bed.

	Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
	Lizzy's bed.

	Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
	the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
	the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
	tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		You scared him...

	Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

				MEAGAN
		I scared him?

	But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Lizzy?

	Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
	in the...


	INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
	a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
	goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
	-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
	all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
	down.

	The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
	Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

	Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

				FREDDY
		Where ya been all my death, baby?

	Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
	tuxedo, crooning:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've been waitin' at the altar for
		a long, long time!

	Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
	spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
	filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
	of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
	asks:

				SATANIC PRIEST
		Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

	Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
	dressed in body bags.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		And the groomsmen...?

	Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
	trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		If anyone here believes that these
		two should not be joined in unholy
		matrimony, let him speak now or
		forever rot in hell...

	>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

				JESSE
		Meagan!

	Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
	in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
	outstretched.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
	encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
	eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

	It's Jason.

	Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
	it down between her eyes...

						TRANSITION CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
	was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
	dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
	on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
	a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
	with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
	she notices something not quite right about the doll.
	She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
	a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy...

	Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

				FREDDY DOLL
		Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

	The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
	thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

	Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
	She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
	Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
	dream.

	ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
	with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
	pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
	out of bed...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
	her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
	tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
	glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
	head.

				MEAGAN
		Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
		up.

	Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
	then frowns.

				LIZZY
		I had a bad dream.

				MEAGAN
		Me, too.

				LIZZY
		I was scared.

				MEAGAN
		Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

				LIZZY
		Promise?

				MEAGAN
		Promise.

	Lizzy hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		I'll never let anyone hurt you.


	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
	A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
	SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
	NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
	the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
	surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
	house.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(filtered)
		As the sun rises on yet another
		morning, still no end in sight for
		the standoff between police and the
		mysterious group known only as the
		"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
		house behind me just thirteen days
		ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
		away teenagers -- have managed to
		keep police at bay for almost two
		weeks while inside they take mind-
		altering narcotics in order to
		communicate with their god --
		Freddy.

	The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
	where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
	down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
	who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
	herself a cup and sits.

				MEAGAN
		Morning.

	Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
	looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
	just a little too cheerfully:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Morning, Meagan.

	Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
	father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
	Meagan's mom bellows:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
			(calls upstairs)
		Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
		is almost ready!

	Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
	into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

	ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

				NEWS REPORTER
		Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
		was released on a legal technicality
		but later burned to death at the
		hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
		parents.  Some years later, a rash
		of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
		age deaths began leaving many in
		the area to wonder... is Freddy
		really dead?

	Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
	breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
	pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
	family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
	Tart, whining.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Hurry up and eat. You don't want
		to be late for special school.

				MEAGAN
		Mom! Don't call it that!

				LIZZY
		I hate that school. The other kids
		are mean... and they're all re-
		tard-ed!

	Meagan snickers.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We don't use that word. They're
		"special" children just like you're
		"special".

	Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
	Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
	the paper.

	ANGLE ON TV --

				NEWS REPORTER
		The cult members have declined to
		an on-camera interview but did send
		out a note with a message. The note
		-- which, by the way, appears to
		have been written in blood -- reads...
			(reads the note)
		To the parents of Springwood --
		Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
		take one of your children as his
		virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
		and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
		-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
		shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
		to rise and rule the darkness forever
		and ever.

	A horn TOOTS outside.

				MEAGAN
		That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

	Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
	dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Oh, look at the time! I've got to
		be going... anyone need me to bring
		anything home tonight?

				MEAGAN
		I need an alarm clock.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		What's wrong with your old one?

				MEAGAN
		Broke.

	Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
	door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're almost out of vodka.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

				JESSE
		Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

				MEAGAN
		My mom...

				JESSE
		And...?

				MEAGAN
		I had another dream last night...

				JESSE
		Was I naked?

				MEAGAN
		No. You were Jason.

				JESSE
		Jason? Oh, yeech...
			(then)
		Was I any good?

	Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


	INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
	his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
	say something.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Do you have to watch that crap all
		the time? Months and months of the
		O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

	Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
	slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
	then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
	into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
	switches the set back on.

	CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
	RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

				NEWS REPORTER
		I'm standing here with State Trooper
		Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
		Governor has called in to deal with
		the cultists because of his past
		experience with occult-style
		murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
		is the only law enforcement officer
		ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
		with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
		killer -- Jason Voorhees.
			(to Murdoch)
		You received some pretty nasty
		injuries in your battle with Jason,
		didn't you, Captain?

				MURDOCH
		Nothing serious... just a few
		stitches.

				NEWS REPORTER
		What about these so called "Freddy"
		cultists? They seem like pretty
		tough customers. Think you'll have
		any trouble getting them out of
		there?

				MURDOCH
		No. Now that the Governor has given
		me complete authority to deal with
		these punks I should be putting an
		end to their situation pretty quick.
		Unless of course their attorney is
		able to get them to come out peace-
		fully... but I don't hold out much
		hope for that.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(to camera)
		Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
		gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
		criminals.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
	to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

				MURDOCH
		Damn media... oughtta be a law.
			(gestures to house)
		Is that shyster still in there
		trying to talk them out?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... he's making them some kind
		of deal.

				MURDOCH
		Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
		assholes. Shakespeare was right --
		kill all the lawyers. Then we could
		kill all the punks with no hassles
		and the world would be a safer place.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Smaller anyway.

				MURDOCH
		Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
		Long-haired, English freak. He was
		probably a punk.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

	Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
	is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
	He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
	punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
	They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
	flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
	disfigured faces.

	The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
	takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
	neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
	his nose nervously as he speaks:

				SLEAZY LAWYER
		So, as I explained to you before,
		the revenues between the TV movie
		deal and the book sale should be
		adequate to fund your joint-defense.
		And I think with my mass media
		hypnosis argument I could get each
		of you a reduced sentence on appeal
		-- say... twenty years each. Out
		in fifteen with good behavior?
		Hmmmmm?

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
	an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
	windshield with a loud SPLAT!

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Jesus Christ!

	Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
	the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
	.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
	the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
	SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

	The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
	of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
	S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
	with foil, the walls have been painted black with
	cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
	black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
	night vision goggles and starts moving through the
	house.

	P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
	team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
	the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
	light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
	face.

	Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
	team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
	guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
	opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
	a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
	starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
	a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
	his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
	have been shredded to the bone.

	Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
	steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
	swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
	His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
	gun.

	The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
	bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
	the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
	room behind them.

	CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
	covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
	both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
	The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
	barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
	the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

	Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
	He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
	cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
	the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

				MURDOCH
		Freeze!

	Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

	The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
	retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
	cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
	guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
	thunder down a back staircase to the...


	INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
	house and most escape through the underground tunnel
	just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
	the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
	is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
	S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hold your fire!

	He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
	flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
	smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
	to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
	-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
	ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Help me, mister... please.

	The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
	down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
	tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
	timer.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hang on, honey... I'll have you
		out of there in a second.

	Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
	passageway and says:

				MURDOCH
		Looks like we'll have to hunt the
		rest of them down. Let's go before
		they get too far.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		We can't leave! Can't you see
		we've got a situation here?

	Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

				MURDOCH
		Leave her.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You're crazy! I can't just leave
		her!

				MURDOCH
		Forget it. I've seen this before.
		There's nothing you can do.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I've got to try...

	The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
	to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
	23... 22...

	The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
	of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
	team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

				MURDOCH
		You're wasting your time.

	The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
	second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
	13...

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Fuck it!

	The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
	and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
	in his arms as he shouts to his men:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing; yelling)
		CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

	The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
	bringing up the rear.

	The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
	girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
	and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
	the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
	-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

	Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
	mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks.

	As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
	the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Are you okay, honey?

	Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
	commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Freddy lives!

	With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
	commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
	his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
	He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
	takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
	style.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		NO!

	The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
	time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
	dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing)
		Jesus... you were going to kill
		that kid, weren't you?

				MURDOCH
		I told you you were wasting your
		time. Once these kids go rabid,
		best thing to do is put 'em down.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You can't be serious...

				MURDOCH
		Dead serious. See... the world is
		made up of rules. Kids don't like
		rules. They rebel for a while, but
		ultimately they start to fall in
		line and become ordinary Joe's like
		you and me. But some kids... dope
		smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
		Satanic lyrics melting what's left
		of their brains... these kids grow
		up to be punks. And when these punks
		step as far over the line as these
		"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
		peace officers have no choice but
		to kill them.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I didn't become a peace officer to
		kill kids.

				MURDOCH
		Punks. There's a difference...
			(under his breath)
		...barely.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
	LIVES!

	We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
	it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
	instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

				MISS KREPPS
		(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

	It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
	struggling to stay awake while others have already
	passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
	She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
	in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
	fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
	on:

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

	Meagan starts to drift off, when...

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing; loud)
		Meagan!?

				MEAGAN
		Yes, ma'am?

				MISS KREPPS
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your oral report?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I'm ready.

				MISS KREPPS
		Please come up here to the podium.

	Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
	snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
	snaps her fingers for quiet.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		You won't think it's funny when
		you haven't learned the fundamentals
		of a free market economy... oh,
		why do I waste my breath? You're
		all going to grow up to be gas
		station attendants and waitresses
		anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		My report is on Global Economic
		Trends.
			(clears throat;
				 begins reading)
		Try and think of a world where there
		is no poverty... no sickness... no
		crime. A world where everyone is
		happy to be alive and everyone lives
		together in peace. This is my dream.

	The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
	BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
	with her report.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		This dream is becoming a reality
		with ever-growing international
		business...

	CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
	turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
	louder.

				MISS KREPPS
		Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

	Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
	voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
	report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
	WIND increases.

	A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
	spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
	to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
	it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
	billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
	with laughter.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		Louder, Meagan... we still can't
		hear you.

	But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
	busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
	the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
	over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
	blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
	that too is swept off.

	Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
	to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
	naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
	face.

	Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
	all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
	in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
	wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

				FREDDY
		Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
		to blow!

	Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
	of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
	pleading:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse... please, help me.

	But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
	up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
	expressionless face.

				FREDDY
		Looks like a photo opportunity to
		me!

	Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
	flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
	beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
	front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
	sneers:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Say... cheesecake!

	PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
	light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
	against the blackboard -- vaporized!

					HARD CUT TO:

	Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
	as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

				MISS KREPPS
		Meagan? Meagan?!

	Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your report?

	Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
	herself together.

				MEAGAN
		Sure...

	Meagan stands up and faints.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

	MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
	standing over her.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
		know where you are?

	Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

				MEAGAN
		I was day dreaming and then I woke
		up but then it was like I was still
		dreaming and then I woke up and
		then I guess I fainted and now I'm
		awake again...

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Are you sure?

	Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(continuing)
		Meagan?

				MEAGAN
		I'm waiting to see if you're going
		to turn into Freddy.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Freddy... I see. You've been watching
		too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
		cult thing -- it's all over the TV
		day and night -- you can't get away
		from it. No wonder you kids are all
		having nightmares.

				MEAGAN
		But this one was different... it
		felt real.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
		aren't real. They're just broken
		fragments of the subconscious mind.

				MEAGAN
		Fear is real though, isn't it? And
		if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
		that make them real?!
			(gets excited)
		And if the nightmares are real then
		is reality like a dream?!

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(cutting her off)
		Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
		that's all.

	The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
	nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

				MEAGAN
		Old witch... what does she know?
		She isn't even qualified to give a
		shot and she's telling me that my
		dreams aren't anything to worry
		about.

				JESSE
		So she said you were okay?

				MEAGAN
		Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
		says it's just a case of heat pro-
		stration and an overdose of TV news.
		Ruined my makeup, too.

				JESSE
		So you're going back to class?

				MEAGAN
		No. She gave me last period off.

				JESSE
		Well, what are you bitching about?
		I could have a compound fracture of
		the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
		from P.E.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! I've been having nightmares
		for almost two weeks now and they
		keep getting worse! Now I'm having
		daymares! I want to know why!

				JESSE
		Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
		it was heat probation?

	Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

				MEAGAN
		You don't understand... I want to
		know more about dreams. What they
		mean... why we have them.

				JESSE
		Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
		got the rest of the day off, that's
		all I'm saying.

				MEAGAN
		That's a good idea. Why don't you
		cut last period and come with me?

				JESSE
		Sure. Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				JESSE
		You want me to cut school so we can
		go to the library?

					   CUT TO:

	INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

	Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
	the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Find anything?

	Jesse looks up suddenly.

				JESSE
		What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

	Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
	TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Did you know that our sub-conscious
		retains everything that ever happened
		to us? Everything. From the time
		we're born until we die.

				JESSE
		Really?

				MEAGAN
		That's how Freddy gets at us...
		by using our sub-conscious fears.
		Fears our conscious minds have
		repressed or forgotten.

				JESSE
		I've got a news flash for you...
		Freddy's dead.

				MEAGAN
		I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
		in our sub-conscious then he can
		never be fully erased. Like a bad
		memory... you may blot it out of
		your mind but it will alway be
		hiding someplace in your dreams.
			(off Jesse's
				 disbelieving stare)
		Weren't you scared as a child by
		something so stupid that you're
		ashamed to admit it?

				JESSE
		No.

				MEAGAN
		No?

				JESSE
		Well, yeah.

				MEAGAN
		Well, what? What is it?

				JESSE
		Well... when I was kid, my brother
		took me to the carnival. And in the
		penny arcade there was this robot
		gunslinger...

				MEAGAN
		Black Bart.

				JESSE
		You know about Black Bart?

				MEAGAN
		Duh. You put your quarter in and he
		says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
		And then you pull your gun out and
		shoot him.

				JESSE
		That's just it -- I never could!
		I'd point the gun right at him and
		shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
		So I always got killed.

				MEAGAN
		No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

				JESSE
		Scared the shit out of me.

	Meagan tries to hide her smile.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 flustered)
		Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
		kid?

	Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 mad)
		Okay, smartass... what about you?
		What scared you the most as a kid?

	A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

				MEAGAN
		I remember... Lizzy wandered off
		one day and we couldn't find her.
		The police came and everything. I
		wasn't really worried until I saw
		her picture on TV... then I got
		really scared.
			(then)
		Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
		think something bad's going to
		happen.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
	her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
	her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
	disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

				LEONARD
		You're stupid!

				LIZZY
		No, you are!

				LEONARD
		They forgot you again!

				LIZZY
		No, they didn't!

				LEONARD
		Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
		to wait out here until it's dark
		and then the monsters are goin'
		come and get you!

				LIZZY
		No they won't, because I'm walkin'
		home!

	Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
	calls after her:

				LEONARD
		Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
		me! I got forgot too, you know!

	Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
	yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
	bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
	down as he follows after Lizzy.

				LEONARD
			(continuing)
		Okay... I'm going to have to report
		this!

	Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
	she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
	standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
	Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
	glances back, the figure is still standing... but
	closer.

	Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
	she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
	street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
	of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
	reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

	The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
	it roars off down the street.

	CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
	in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
	car and rushes inside.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
	calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
	Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Didn't you get my message?

				MEAGAN
		What message?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		I called the school after lunch...
		I had to stay late after work...
		I...

	Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
	she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
	drunk and has been crying.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Don't you dare blame this on her,
		you sorry bastard! It's all your
		fault!
			(to Meagan)
		Where have you been anyway?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		A likely Goddamn story!

	Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

				MEAGAN
		Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
		Where's Lizzy?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		She didn't come home from school
		today. The police got a report that
		a girl fitting Lizzy's description
		was forced into a car by some
		crazies. They're pretty sure it was
		this "Freddy" cult.

				MEAGAN
			(shocked)
		Oh, my God...

	Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
	comfort her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Now don't worry. The police are
		doing everything they can.

	Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
	men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

				TROOPER
			(O.S.)
		Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
		up here!


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

	As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
	the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
	the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
	attention to the floor next to the bed.

	Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
	including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
	the top.

	Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

				TROOPER
		Looks like she was in the cult all
		along.

				MEAGAN
		No... no, she wouldn't do that!
		Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

				TROOPER
		I know it's hard to believe, miss.
		But a lot of good kids get caught
		up in this kind of trouble.

	Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
	tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
	little unicorn.

				MURDOCH
		Punks...

	Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
	the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Captain Murdoch... is there any-
		thing we can do?

				MURDOCH
		You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
		daughter before... well, before it's
		too late. But rest assured, if I
		can't persuade her to come back to
		her loving home, then I'll do what's
		best for her. I know you and your
		wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
			(to his men)
		Come on... I want to go talk to
		Erwin.

	Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
	Jesse out of the house.

				JESSE
		Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		Over to Stormie's.

				JESSE
		Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
		friends anymore since she stole that
		twenty dollars from you.

				MEAGAN
		That was her "klepto" phase... when
		she was dating that gang member.
		She dumped him a long time ago.

				JESSE
		I still don't understand. What has
		she got to do with Lizzy missing?

				MEAGAN
		She used to be in the Freddy cult.
		Maybe she knows where they took
		Lizzy.

	They exit to Jesse's car.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
	blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

				STORMIE
		If I did know I would call the
		police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
		No telling what those freaks will
		do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
		are hard core.

				JESSE
		I thought you were in the cult?

				STORMIE
		I was in the cult for a week cause
		my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
		he was. But I just liked the music
		and the clothes... when they were
		clean, but not like the violence
		and stuff. But that was just my
		"cult" phase... but I got past that.
		You know, just like my "gang" phase
		when I was dating Ramon and then
		before that was my "death rock"
		phase when I was dating Stuart...

				JESSE
		Uh, excuse me... but what phase
		are we in now?

				STORMIE
		Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
		what's it fuckin' to ya?!

				JESSE
			(to Meagan)
		Why don't you just let the cops find
		her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
		knows how to deal with these cultist
		psychos. He was the man who got Jason
		Voorhees.

				MEAGAN
		That guy in my dreams...

				STORMIE
		Jason kicked his ass.

						   QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

	Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
	younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
	Jason in panic.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
		thirteen bullets in Jason before
		he hacked his head open.

	Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
	staggers back, raising his pistol.

				JESSE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		But even with his head hacked open
		and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
		still managed to put his last bullet
		in Jason's eye.

	Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
	Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
	body hits the ground.


	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

	Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
	Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
	medical contraptions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
		worked at the hospital where they
		took him. He said that Murdoch lost
		more than half his brain and what
		little that was left was all twisted
		up inside. And they had to replace
		his skull with a metal plate to
		keep that from leaking out.

	In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
	eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		They say he hasn't been the same
		since.

					CUT BACK TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

				JESSE
		So what's different about him?

				STORMIE
		One thing... he used to be a
		Democrat. Now he votes straight
		Republican.

				MEAGAN
		I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
		cult or something.

				STORMIE
		Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

				MEAGAN
		I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
		got to find her and save her from
		Freddy before that crazy cop kills
		her.

				JESSE
		Just where are you going to look?
		I mean, these cult guys could be
		holding her anywhere.

				MEAGAN
		Murdoch said something about going
		to talk to somebody named Erwin.

				STORMIE
		Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
		Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
		they took Lizzy!

				JESSE
		Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
		that used to eat bugs?

				STORMIE
			(annoyed)
		Who else?
			(to Meagan; bright)
		Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
		home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
		up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
		Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
		back and the cops put him away for
		his own safety. They say Freddy's
		put a death hex on Erwin.

				JESSE
		A death hex?

				STORMIE
		Yes, a death hex. You know... where
		someone wants you dead!

				MEAGAN
		Where is he?

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

	Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
	and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
	park, Meagan turns to him and says:

				MEAGAN
		I want you to stay here.

				JESSE
		Why?

				MEAGAN
		Don't be mad... it's just that you
		might scare him.

				JESSE
		Scare him?

				STORMIE
		What she's subtly trying to tell
		you is that this needs a woman's
		gentle touch... butthead.

				MEAGAN
		Just stay here... okay?

	Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
	cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
	turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
	the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
	row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
	on the glass.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
		of visitors. Now be a good boy...
			(to Meagan & Stormie)
		You've got five minutes. I'll be
		right down the hall if you need me.

	The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
	thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
	They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
	little closer to the glass.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin...?

	SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
	face to the glass as he screams:

				ERWIN
		SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

	Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
	quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
	inspection.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Where do you shoot?

				MEAGAN
		Shoot?

				STORMIE
		He's talking about dream dope --
		the stuff the cultists shoot up
		with so they can talk to Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		I don't do drugs.

				ERWIN
		You're not in the cult?

				MEAGAN
		No.

				ERWIN
		Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

				MEAGAN/STORMIE
		No.

				ERWIN
		I don't trust you... better take off
		your clothes so I can check you for
		tracks.

				STORMIE
		Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
		hard data -- not a floppy disk.

	Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
	to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
	mattress.

				ERWIN
		Well, what do you want? Can't you
		see I'm busy?

				MEAGAN
		Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

				STORMIE
		I told her you might know where
		they took her.

				ERWIN
		I already told the cops everything
		I know.

				MEAGAN
		Tell me... please.

				ERWIN
		Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
		but I've got my own problems with
		Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

				MEAGAN
		Then tell me why they took her...

				ERWIN
		To bear his child. Freddy wants to
		be human again. In order to do that
		he has to be "reborn".

				MEAGAN
		How can he do that?

				ERWIN
		He has to marry a virgin on holy
		ground. Then the cult consumate
		the marriage by impregnating her.

				STORMIE
		The whole cult? Yeech!

				ERWIN
		Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
		It's sort of a tradition with him.

				MEAGAN
		So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

				ERWIN
		And Freddy enters the soul of the
		fetus through a dream state. Voila!
		Rebirth.

	There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

				STORMIE
		That's the stupidest shit I ever
		heard.

				ERWIN
		Hey, they're not my rules... some-
		body else wrote 'em.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... you've got to help me find
		Lizzy. You're my only hope.

	Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

				ERWIN
		I'll help you find your sister, but
		you've got to help me.

				MEAGAN
		Anything. Just name it.

				ERWIN
		You have to help me kill Freddy.

	Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

				STORMIE
		But Freddy's dead.

				ERWIN
		Freddy lives...
			(looks at Meagan)
		If only in our dreams.

	Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
	her away.

				STORMIE
		Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
		is up. He's giving me the creeps.

	But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

				MEAGAN
		How can you kill a dream?

				ERWIN
		When it's not a dream.
			(then)
		Do we have a deal?

	Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
	thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
	over his.

				MEAGAN
		Deal.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
	a pay phone, arguing.

				JESSE
		No! I won't do it!

				MEAGAN
		Come on, Jesse! Please...?

				JESSE
		It's illegal! I could go to jail!

				STORMIE
		How will they ever know? Don't be
		such a pussy!

				JESSE
		Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

				STORMIE
		Okay, I will!

				MEAGAN
		No! They'll never believe her!

				STORMIE
		I can disguise my voice...
			(lowers voice)
		Hello, how do you do? My name is
		Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
		actually a wimp.

				MEAGAN
		They'll never believe that. Come
		on, Jesse... for me?

				JESSE
		Okay... okay... I'll do it.
			(to Stormie)
		And I'm not a wimp!

	Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
	moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
	both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
	the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
	girls shut up, he says:

				JESSE
			(continuing)
		I need a quarter for the phone.

	Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
	re-enters the booth.

	ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

	The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Springwood Mental Center... how
		can I help you?

				JESSE
			(filtered; disguising
				 his voice)
		There's a bomb planted in your
		building.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Who is this?

				JESSE
		If I were you -- I'd get my ass
		out of there.

	In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
	something to Jesse.

				JESSE
			(continuing; adding)
		Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

	CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

	The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
	fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
	into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
	files out with the others, still wearing his straight
	jacket.

	Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
	flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
	off towards the fence between himself and freedom
	when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

				SECURITY GUARD
		Hey, Erwin... where do you think
		you're going?

	Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

				SECURITY GUARD
			(continuing)
		I'm talking to you, asshole!

	Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
	him.

	In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
	guard closes the distance.

				JESSE
		He's not going to make it.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to do something!

	With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

	Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
	the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
	drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
	Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
	an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
	RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
	does a 180, and PEELS off.

	ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
	of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
	hand to Jesse.

				ERWIN
		Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
		busting me out of there!

	Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
	fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

				JESSE
		Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
		me one favor -- don't eat nothing
		disgusting. My stomach is tight
		enough as it is.

	The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
	puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
	street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
	plucks it out...

	Jesse's front license plate.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

	CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
	close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
	inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
	starts to settle down... falling asleep...

	The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
	her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

	LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
	the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
	gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


	INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
	a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
	is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
	of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
	with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
	hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
	terrible chorus of the damned.

	The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
	the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
	is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
	mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
	swings open as the cultists near.

	The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
	her tight as they push her face forward into the
	mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
	face disappearing into the mirror.

	ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
	face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
	thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
	darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
	the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
	moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
	out.

	The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
	locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
	things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
	the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
	releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

	The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
	the...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
	conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
	as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
	doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
	cultist thrusts under her.

	Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
	mouth -- the Dream Demons.


	EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

	Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
	pulls up next to a run-down building.


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
	old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
	towards the back, to a large table and a collection
	of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
	starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
	syringes laying scattered about the floor.

				ERWIN
		Damn! We must have just missed them!

	Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

				MEAGAN
		Oh, my God -- she was here! This
		is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
		torn!
			(grabs Erwin)
		Erwin... we've got to find her!

				ERWIN
		We're too late! There's no way...
		except...

				MEAGAN
		Except what?!

				ERWIN
		We could go after Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		How?

	Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
	up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
	he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
	box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
	and several pairs of cult shades.

				ERWIN
		We'll inject ourselves with Dream
		Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
		brings on a dreamlike state.

	Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
	approval.

				MEAGAN
		Okay... let's do it!

				JESSE
		Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
		what if one of us gets hooked or
		something?
			(whispers)
		We could turn out like him!

	Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry about it. We need you
		wide awake anyway.

				JESSE
		What for?

				ERWIN
		We're going to go under and try to
		find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
		him and bring him here. Then you
		kill him with this...

	Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

				JESSE
		This rusty chunk of shit? What
		good is this?

				ERWIN
		It's not the gun, it's what's in
		it -- silver bullets blessed by a
		priest.

				JESSE
		Will that work?

				ERWIN
			(shrugs)
		Should. But then...

				JESSE
			(finishes for him)
		You don't make the rules... yeah,
		yeah.

				MEAGAN
		What should we do?

				ERWIN
		Have a seat over there and make
		yourselves comfortable. Roll up
		your sleeves and put these on...

	Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
	sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
	Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

				STORMIE
		Oh, cool!

				MEAGAN
		What are they for?

				ERWIN
		It's how the cult keeps in constant
		contact with Freddy. The little
		lights flashing are a sustained
		occular input that causes your brain
		to resonate at approximately the
		same frequency at which the dream
		state is most likely to occur.

	All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

				STORMIE
		Whatever...
			(to Meagan; excited)
		Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

	Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
	up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
	chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
	takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
	lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
	glasses.

				ERWIN
		It helps to hold hands if you want
		to go together...

	Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
	watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
	a final warning:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		And remember... Freddy knows what
		scares you.

	Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

	INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
	(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
	The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

				ERWIN
		WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
	asleep in their chairs.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
	mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
	pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
	fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
	they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

				LIZZY
			(distant)
		Meagan... help me... please...

	Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
	suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
	and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

				ERWIN
		Freddy's trying to split us up...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
	mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
	and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
	the muzzle as he says:

				JESSE
		Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
		in Dreamland now.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
	boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
	stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
	of Erwin and Stormie.

				FREDDY
		Looking for some-body?

	Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
	lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
	Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
	to Erwin:

				STORMIE
		I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
		us up!

	But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

				FREDDY
		Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

	Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
	claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
	Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
	Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
	apron.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Stew on this, bitch!

	Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
	falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

				STORMIE
		Shoot him! Shoot him!

	Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Freddy turns toward Erwin.

				FREDDY
		Well, well, well... if it isn't
		my ol' pal, Erwin.

	Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've got something special in mind
		for you...

	Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
	out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
	his finger.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

				STORMIE
		You didn't help me, you pussy!
		I could've had him!
			(smacks him some more)
		You gutless... spinless... jelly
		fish!

	Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


	INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

	Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
	Lizzy's voice...

				LIZZY
			(V.O.)
		Meagan... help me... Meagan...

	It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
	door.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
	table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
	FREDDY LIVES!

				MEAGAN
		Daddy?

	He looks up and quietly shushes her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

	And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
	newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
	again... upstairs.

	As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
	her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
	looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
	to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
	mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

	Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
	for help draws her to...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
	covers.

				LIZZY
		Help me...

	Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
	pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
	her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
	it's way out.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Meagan...

	Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
	Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
	Meagan in the chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
	Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

				STORMIE
		Are you okay?

	They help Meagan to her feet.

				MEAGAN
			(shaky)
		He got away... I had him and he
		got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
		lost her...

				ERWIN
		Well, atleast you're not dead.

				MEAGAN
		No... I'm not dead...
			(realizes)
		No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

				STORMIE
		He killed me, too. But look...

	Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
	unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
	Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

				MEAGAN
		Now that I think about it -- he's
		killed me in all my nightmares. But
		I'm not dead... what does it mean?

				ERWIN
		It means we've still got some time
		left. Until his remains are host to
		the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
		hurt us.

				JESSE
		Hello. The Dream Demons...?

				ERWIN
		Freddy made a pact with Satan when
		he died... so Satan bestowed upon
		him the Dream Demons. They're the
		source of Freddy's power to manipulate
		our physical reality. Without them...
		he's powerless -- nothing more than
		a bad dream.
			(off Jesse's cynical
				 look)
		Hey, like I said... I don't make
		the rules.

				MEAGAN
		But we've still got a chance, right?
		A chance to kill Freddy before he
		gets back his power?

				ERWIN
		We already tried that. There's no
		way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
		clever. He knows how to get to us.

				MEAGAN
		Then let's get somebody else. Some-
		body strong.

				STORMIE
		Yeah! We could hire somebody to
		kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

				ERWIN
		You would have to hire a thousand
		of them... or one really big guy
		who isn't afraid of anything. No
		fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

				JESSE
		Where are you going to find a hit
		man? The yellow pages? In your
		dreams...

	Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
	bolt and she stammers out a name:

				MEAGAN
		Jason...

				JESSE
		Jason?

				MEAGAN
		Jason Voorhees...

				ERWIN
			(brightens)
		Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
		The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

				STORMIE
		Sounds like our man!

				JESSE
		Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
		isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

				ERWIN
		Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
		Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
		know how to bring him back to life.

				JESSE
		Somehow I just knew you would.

				ERWIN
		But that's not the problem. The
		problem is control. Once we bring
		Jason back from the dead... I'm not
		one hundred percent sure he'll do
		what we tell him.

				STORMIE
		Well, that's okay... as long as he
		doesn't chop us all up.

	Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
		so tell me the truth. Do you think
		if we do this -- if we go and get
		Jason and bring him back to life,
		that he could kill Freddy?

				ERWIN
		No doubt about. Jason could wreck
		Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
		But if Freddy has home court advan-
		tage... I don't know. Too close to
		call. The trick would be to get Jason
		to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
		and drag him out to our reality.

				MEAGAN
		I haven't got a choice. I've got to
		try something...
			(turns to Stormie &
				 Jesse)
		I can't ask either of you to help
		me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
		disgusting...

				STORMIE
		Hey, we sisters have to stand
		together, right? Where you lead --
		I'll follow. Count me in.

	Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
	He looks them over and sighs:

				JESSE
		Let me get this straight... we're
		going to go dig one dead maniac up
		to fight another dead maniac?

				ERWIN
		That's about the size of it... and
		I'd be doing you a disservice if I
		said there weren't a modicum of risk
		involved.

				JESSE
		Meagan... I don't want to do this...

				MEAGAN
		You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
		your fight. I understand.

				JESSE
		But I damn sure don't want you to
		do it without me. Count me in.

	Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
	she pushes him away.

				ERWIN
		Look out Freddy... here we come.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

	In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
	is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
	up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
	the radio.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
		What's matter, girl... you hear
		somethin'?

	Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
	closer.

	The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
	into the darkness when a line of several hearses
	approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
	the driver's window rolls down.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(continuing)
		What's this? A funeral procession?

	A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
	and says:

				CULTIST
		That's exactly what it is.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(suspicious)
		Yeah? Whose?

				CULTIST
		Yours.

	BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
	the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
	a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
	ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

	Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
	the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
	cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
	procession proceeds inside.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

	The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
	cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
	wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
	of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
	charred bones.

	Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
	and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
	around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
	with droopy eyes.

	LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
	the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
	Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
	more surreal as another cult member steps forward
	with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
	the funnel.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
	around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
	blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
	muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

	There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
	Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
	leaps out of the pit and cries:

				FREDDY
		Smokin'!

	Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
	FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
	building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
	them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
	reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		We're almost there...

				MEAGAN
			(V.O.)
		We should pull over and ask
		directions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		If it doesn't offend the men...
		ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Very funny.


	EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
	station.

				STORMIE
		I don't think they're open.

				MEAGAN
		It says, open all night.

	Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

				JESSE
		Hey! Can we get some service out
		here?!

				STORMIE
		I don't think there's anybody
		here...

	Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
	side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you kids want?

				MEAGAN
		We're looking for the old cemetery
		that's supposed to be around here...
		somewhere.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you want to know for?

				STORMIE
		We want to see it.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
		'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

				JESSE
		Look, mister... can you give us
		directions or not?

	The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
	over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
	Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
	under a baseball cap.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		You're not goin' up there to do
		somethin' stupid, are you?

				JESSE
			(laughs; nervous)
		Stupid? Like what?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
		that's what!

	Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
	busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
	their heads innocently in a big performance that
	wouldn't fool a stick.

				JESSE
			(looks at Meagan)
		Jesus... why would anyone do that?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		I dunno... but people do.

				STORMIE
		Been dug up a few times already,
		has he?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		More times than I care to remember.

				MEAGAN
		Well, we're just doing an article
		for our high school newspaper about
		the dangers of breaking into
		cemeteries at night. You know,
		stuff that can get you hurt...

	The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
	acquiesces.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well... okay... as long as you're
		not going up there to do something
		stupid.
			(pointing)
		Take this road up about a mile and
		make a left at the ol' saw mill.
		That road will take you right on
		in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
		can't miss it.

	Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
	ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
	PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
	WILL BE SHOT!

	Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
	cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
	shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
	Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		What's the story on Jason Voorhees
		anyway?

				STORMIE
		Where have you been? Jason was that
		guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
		chopping up camp counselors, duh?

				MEAGAN
		I knew that. What I mean was why?

				ERWIN
		It started a long time ago, back in
		the fifties, when Jason drown at
		Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
		berserk and started killing the
		counselors.

				STORMIE
		She got her head chopped off by one
		of the girls she was trying to kill!

				ERWIN
		Right. And then Jason came back from
		his watery grave to get revenge.

				JESSE
		He came back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
		before they finally caught up to him.

				MEAGAN
		What happened to him then?

				ERWIN
		They killed him.

				JESSE
		How can you kill somebody who's
		back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Not very well apparently. Jason
		keeps coming back to life and
		chopping people up. It's a never
		ending cycle of terror up here at
		Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

				MEAGAN
		Why does he keep coming back to
		life and killing people?

				ERWIN
		They say he's looking for revenge
		on the camp counselor who murdered
		him as a child. Jason just happens
		to go about it in the socially
		unacceptable way of hacking through
		every teenager he finds until he
		gets the right one.
			(spots grave)
		Here it is...

	Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

	ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
	Died:1953.

	Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
	stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

	Jesse and Erwin start digging.

	ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
	Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
	hits something solid.

	Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
	coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
	jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

	The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
	noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
	and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

	Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

	Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
	their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
	the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
	shirt, and calmly eats it.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
	holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
	hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
	tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
	taking anymore chances with bugs.

	Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
	at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
	-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
	mask.

					CUT TO:

	The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
	Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
	the lid closed.

	Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

	In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
	Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
	Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
	and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

				ERWIN
		Look... the boogerman!
			(laughs)
		Get it?!

	Stormie slaps his hand away.

				STORMIE
		Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
		Ug! I thought I had seen the last
		of those when my brother graduated
		third grade!

				ERWIN
		We just dug up a rotting corpse and
		you're worried about a little snot.

	Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
	beside him.  She purrs:

				MEAGAN
		I'm exhausted... wake me when we
		get back home.

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
		we've still got a lot of work to
		do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

	This news sobers everyone up immediately.

				STORMIE
		Well, that means we've all got to
		stay awake!

				JESSE
		Duh?!

				MEAGAN
		I know! We'll sing a song!
			(starts singing)
		Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
		the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream. Come
		on, everybody!

	Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
	chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
	the night.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
	to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

				MEAGAN
		...merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream.

	In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
	breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

	Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
	drooping.  The car starts to weave.

	ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
	a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
	FOR FOOD.

	Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
	on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

	Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
	board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
	out of the driver's window.

	CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
	ground, the red digits cascading up.

	Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
	the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
	his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

				FREDDY
		Shouldn't dream and drive.

	Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
	out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
	it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
	belching HELLFIRE.

	ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
	close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
	maremobile closing from behind fast.

	The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
	car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
	of the dozen of levers on the dash.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
	of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
	of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
	the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
	trunk lid opens.

	ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
	remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
	the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
	of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
	of the bag.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Looks like the cat's out of the
		bag now!

	Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

	The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
	car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
	all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
	startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
	nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

				MEAGAN
		It's Freddy!

	WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
	as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
	dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
	maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
	A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

	Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
	the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
	back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
	seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
	EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
	their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
	boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
	the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
	under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

	As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
	she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
	her legs.  Meagan screams.

	Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
	forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
	SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
	to swerve violently from side to side.

	Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

	CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
	up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
	into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
	Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
	CUTTING forward towards...

	CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
	it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
	road, veering into a tree line.

	CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
	the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

	Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
	overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
	EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

	In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
	on inside.

	The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
	ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
	door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
	embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
	around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
	is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
	Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
	Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
		to get him to a doctor.

	Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
	the farmer on the phone.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry... an ambulance is on
		the way.

	Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

				MEAGAN
		Oh, God... Jesse...

	Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
	garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
	untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

				ERWIN
		Meagan... listen to me... The cops
		are on their way. If they find me
		and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
		there, we're finished.

				MEAGAN
		Go... get out of here. Take Jason
		and Stormie with you.

				STORMIE
		I'm staying with you.

	Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

				ERWIN
		I'll call you at the hospital.

				STORMIE
		How?

				ERWIN
		Somehow!

	Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
	into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
	growing close.

					CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
	special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
	doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
	finishes, Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		Is he going to be okay?

				DOCTOR
		Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
		His leg is broken in four places
		and he has four broken ribs and a
		concussion.

	Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
	Stormie turns to the doctor.

				STORMIE
		Hey doc, is there someplace I
		could get us something to eat?

				DOCTOR
		I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
		There are some vending machines in
		the lobby.
			(to Meagan)
		I'll be back to check on him in a
		couple of hours.

	The doctor exits.

				STORMIE
		I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
		score us some munchies.

	Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
	head on Jesse's hand.


	INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
	the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
	at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
	and Erwin.

	Stormie dashes for the staircase.


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
	monitor BEEPS...

	On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
	peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
	ducks back down.

	Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
	and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

	Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
	onto the curtain.

	CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
	the rings.

	Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
	away.

	Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
	again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
	are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
	of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
	the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
	mattress.


	INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
	she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
	along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
	them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
	out into...


	EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
	in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
	and gunbelt.

	Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
	fear... staring at something coming down the street.

	It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

				FREDDY
			(ala John Wayne)
		Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
		ain't big enough for the two of
		us... draw!

	Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
	He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
	FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
	and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
	and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

	Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

				FREDDY
		Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
		you just go get [BEEP]


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
	wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


	INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

	Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
	empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
	gun you ever saw and says:

				FREDDY
		Go ahead... make my dream!

	Freddy FIRES!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
	Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
	flat line.  Jesse is dead.

	A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
	Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
	and screams.

	Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
	gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy killed Jesse...

	Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
	of the room.


	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
	the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

				STORMIE
		Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
		think a nurse in a hospital would
		have seen a dead body before.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse...

	Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
	off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
	come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
	Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
	and company go thundering past.

	Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
		please pick up the white paging
		phone for a message?

	Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
	announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
	Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
	and picks up the white paging phone.

				STORMIE
			(into phone)
		This is Stormie...

	Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
	station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
	Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

				MURDOCH
		Did you see a couple of girls go
		by here a moment ago?

	Stormie gestures to the elevators.

				STORMIE
		Just missed 'em.

	Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
	men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
	relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

				HOSPITAL OPERATOR
			(filtered)
		The message is from Erwin... he
		says to meet him at the side
		entrance in two minutes.

	Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
	staircase.


	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
	Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
	He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
	inside, climbing in after her and asking:

				STORMIE
		Where'd you get the truck?

				ERWIN
		Same place I've got Jason hid.

				STORMIE
		And where's that?

				ERWIN
		A place where no one ever goes.

	Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
	out of the parking lot.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
	worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
	past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
	short distance away from the pier and the three of
	them climb out.

	Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
	as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
	platform tied up to the end.

				STORMIE
		What'd you do -- take him for a
		swim?

				ERWIN
		Almost.

	Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
	a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
	down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
	pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
	Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
	asks:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Is she going to be alright?

				STORMIE
		I don't know. She's pretty fucked
		up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

				ERWIN
		You're a strong woman.

				STORMIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
		anything.

	Stormie gestures to the tarp.

				STORMIE
		Is this him?

				ERWIN
		Yeah...
			(whips back tarp)
		Meet the new and improved Jason.

	ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
	platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
	coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
	done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
	barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
	been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
	mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
	bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

				STORMIE
		Why'd you put that stupid mask
		on him?

				ERWIN
		Take a look...

	Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
	and quickly replaces it.

				STORMIE
		Good idea.

				ERWIN
		Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
		is he?

				STORMIE
		So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
		Osbourne song backwards or something?

				ERWIN
		I'm afraid it's not that simple...

				STORMIE
		I thought you said you knew how to
		bring him back to life?

				ERWIN
		I do! But when I was putting him
		back together, I noticed something
		was missing.

	Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

				STORMIE
		Awwww, he won't be needing that...
		I mean, what girl would let him
		put his rotten ol'...

				ERWIN
			(cuts her off)
		No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
		it's missing.

				STORMIE
		Well... does it really matter?
		Can't you use an aquarium pump or
		something?

				ERWIN
		No... he has to have a heart. A
		human heart. A good one.

	Meagan speaks for the first time:

				MEAGAN
		I know where we can get a heart...
		A good one.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
	a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
	Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
	parked a safe distance away.

				ERWIN
		That guard in there might pose a
		problem.

				MEAGAN
		Do you think you and Stormie could
		keep him occupied for a few minutes?

	Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
	not?

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Okay... let's do it.

	A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
	up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
	and goes to the glass door, peering out.

	ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
	making out -- hot and heavy.


	INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

	Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
	crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
	to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
	dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
	full of organs, etc.

	Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
	one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
	ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
	Even worse.

	Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
	to quiver as she caresses his face.


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
	in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
	He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
	better look.

	Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

				STORMIE
		Hey! Watch that!

				ERWIN
		I'm just trying to make it look real.

				STORMIE
		Just keep your hands above the bra,
		pizza face.

	The windows are starting to steam up.


	INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

	Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
	gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
	ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
	knife.

	Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
	sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
	far above her head.

				MEAGAN
		Forgive me, Jesse...

	Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
	sickening THWACK!


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
	obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
	deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
	the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
	They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
	another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
	parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
	his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

	Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
	shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
	guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
	the morgue.

				STORMIE
		He's head right for her! Do some-
		thing!

	Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


	INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
	chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
	fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
	then starts pulling harder.

	In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
	and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
	the HORN stops.

	Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
	to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
	tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

	The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
	drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
	unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
	two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
	and kicks the door.

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
	inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
	He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
	of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
	a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
	a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
	cabinet...

	Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
	and cries:

				GUARD
		Stop right there!

	Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
	The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
	curses and races for the...


	EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

	The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
	close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
	shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
	guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
	that the door has closed and locked behind him.

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
	cemetery.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		They said they were writin' for

				MURDOCH
		Teenagers are notorious liars.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well, after I heard about the

	The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Damn kids... I just knew they were

	The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Just got a call on the radio --
		three juveniles just broke into the
		morgue -- one male, two female. The
		guard is pretty sure the male is in
		the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Sounds like the same kids I saw.

				MURDOCH
		Did the guard say what they took?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
		they carved his heart out.
			(beat)
		They got away in a pick-up -- the
		guard didn't get the license. You
		want me to put out an A.P.B.?

				MURDOCH
		No... that won't be necessary. I
		know just where they're going, and
		just what they're up to. And this
		time... I'll be ready.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
	as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
	dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
	her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
	her and says:

				STORMIE
		You've got to quit blaming your-
		self for what happened to Jesse...
		it wasn't your fault.

				MEAGAN
		He didn't want to come with us...
		but he did anyway. He did it for me.

				STORMIE
		I'm not sorry I came... I don't
		think Jesse would be, either.

				MEAGAN
		I just can't believe he's dead. I
		keep thinking he'll show up any
		minute...

				ERWIN
		Well, that just about does it...

	Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
	the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
	it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
	Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
	them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
	from the water's edge.

	In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
	cable.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		As you can see, I've excavated the
		power cable that runs across the
		bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
		away the insulation, exposing a
		patch of cable right near the water's
		edge.

	Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
	at the head of the trench.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Now when I kick this over, the water
		will wash down the trench and bridge
		an eletrical gap between the cable
		and the lake. There's plenty of
		voltage, so it should work.

				STORMIE
		So you kick the bucket and Jason
		lives.

				ERWIN
		Yeah, right...
			(then)
		Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

	Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
	the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
	A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
	glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
	girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
	engulfing the diving platform.

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
	onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

	CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
	spirals down into the eye hole like water running
	down a drain.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
	eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

					OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

	EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

	CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
	reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
	pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
	beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

	JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
	down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
	rye. He bellows:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Jason! Git your ass over here!

	Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
	slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
	several paces away.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		What did I teach you, boy? Don't
		ever take your mask off out in
		public. I don't want nobody to see
		that ugly mug of yours.

	Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
	smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
	woodshed.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Go git in the woodshed.

	Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
	knows what's coming next.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Drop them overalls and lay over
		them logs...

	Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
	Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
	calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Jason! Come here!

	Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
	towards his mother.

				JASON'S FATHER
		What are you doing woman?

	Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
	dollars and change.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I saved up some money... I want
		you to take and go on up to that
		summer camp just up the road. Tell
		the man you want to stay there.

				JASON'S FATHER
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing, bitch?!

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

				JASON'S FATHER
		You ain't sending him nowhere.
			(to Jason)
		Bring me that money, boy!

	Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
	obey, when his mother shoos him away.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Go on now... go!

	Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
		the shed, woman!

	Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		You ain't ever taking anyone to
		the shed ever again.

	Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
	back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
	Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
	coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
	arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
	view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
	way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
	him, calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		Go on, son... have a good time!
		Mommy will come and git you some
		day soon!

	Jason turns and runs to...


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
	to the camp with his jar of money.

	In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
	and shakes his hand.

				HEAD COUNSELOR
		Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
		you'll have a great time!

					CUT TO:

	The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
	laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
	breaks away, running towards the pier.

	Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
	reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
	distortions in the water make his face look normal.

	Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
	aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
	appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
	he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

	Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
	stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
	water.

	JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
	whoever is holding him under.

	Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
	the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
	him before he dies.

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
	the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
	shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

				ERWIN
		Holy shit! It worked!

	Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
	is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
	to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

				MEAGAN
		It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
		it off!

				ERWIN
		Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
		to me that I hadn't really planned
		for that contingency.

				STORMIE
		Just don't stand there! Do something!

	But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
	rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
		Do you hear me? Get up!

	Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
	against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
	rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

	A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
	and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
	electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
	smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
	Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

				ERWIN
		Well... it's off now.

	Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
	shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
	between them, offering quick excuses and humble
	apologies.

	All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
	never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
	the lake.

	Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
	after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
	gait.

	Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
	dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
	out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
	and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
	and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
	then calls to the girls:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
		up in the tool shed!

	Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
	through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
	girl and runs away.


	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
	spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

				MEAGAN
		Who are you calling?!

				STORMIE
		The cops! Who else?!

				MEAGAN
		Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
		up and throw away the key!

				STORMIE
		Fine by me!
			(clicks the receiver)
		Damnit! It's dead!

	Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
	the door shut behind him.

				ERWIN
		He's right behind me!

	Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
	Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

				STORMIE
			(to Erwin)
		You're the one who brought him
		back to life!

				ERWIN
		And?!

				STORMIE
		Well, do something!

	Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
	Stormie clucks:

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, some hero!

	Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
	Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
	closet, closing themselves inside.

	They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
	moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
	breathing.

	Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
	closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
	out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

	Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
	up in front of him and yells:

				MEAGAN
		STOP!

	To everyone's shock... Jason does.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now... just stop! We're the ones
		that brought you back to life.
		And you have no right to kill us
		with that chainsaw! In fact... you
		owe us...

				STORMIE
		That's right! She gave you her
		boyfriend's heart, you know!

				MEAGAN
		That's right.

	Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Look! Here's his picture...

	Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
	opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
	inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
	in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
	Jesse with a meaty finger.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now, I know that you've been through
		a lot. And I know that you're pissed
		off about being murdered and all.

				STORMIE
			(interjects)
		I know I would be!

				MEAGAN
		But if you help us kill Freddy
		Krueger... I promise to help you
		find the little bastard that
		killed you. What do you say? Have
		we got a deal?

	Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
	it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
	he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

	Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
	windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
	get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
	the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

	ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
	lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
	weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
	force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		You in there! This is Captain Renton
		Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
		ordering you to come out with your
		hands up! I'll give you until the
		count of three...
			(beat)
		Three!

	Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
	closet.

				MEAGAN
			(whispering)
		Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
		here and don't come out until we
		tell you. Stormie... help me!

	Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
	closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
	their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
	raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
	the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
	in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
	searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright... anybody else left in
		there had better say their prayers!

				ERWIN
		There's no one else inside.

				MURDOCH
		Is that a fact?
			(into bullhorn)
		Okay... you had your chance!

	Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
	and shouts:

				COP
		Hey, look!

	All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
	massive frame is filling the doorway.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Holy Mary, mother of God... would
		you look at the size of that guy?

				MURDOCH
			(almost happy)
		I knew it!

	All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
	suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
	behind him.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Stand back! I'll handle this.

	Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		You...

	Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
	Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
	a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

	A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
	down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
	up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing;
				 into radio)
		Let her go.


	EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
	laser-guided napalm bomb.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

	A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
	Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

	SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
	in on the laser dot on his chest.

	BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
	All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
	Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
	as he embraces the terrible sight.

				MURDOCH
		That'll teach you to fuck with the
		law, Voorhees!

	A cop behind him says:

				COP
		Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

	Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
	is burning above the brim.

	Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
	flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
	a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
	Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
	worrisome looks through the windows just before the
	cars pull away.

	As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
	something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
	form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
	onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

				CURIOUS COP
		Hey... do you see that?

	But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
	pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
	looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

				PARTNER
		See what?

				CURIOUS COP
		I thought I saw something...

	He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

	Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
	sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
	car and driving away.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

	A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
	door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
	behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
	female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
	her desk.

	Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
	watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
	begins to devour three combo-burritos.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to try and stay awake.

				STORMIE
		Getting something to eat might help.
			(calls to Deputy)
		Yo, Butch!

				DEPUTY MILLER
		It's Deputy Miller.

				STORMIE
		Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
		we have something to eat?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		I thought you psychos only ate
		human hearts?

				STORMIE
		And I thought you pigs only ate
		donuts.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Don't make me come back there.

				STORMIE
			(low; to Meagan)
		Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
		combo-burrito cud!

	Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
	the floor in defeat.

				MEAGAN
		What am I going to do? I'll never
		be able to find Lizzy now.

				STORMIE
		You should be worrying about your-
		self... I know I am.

	Stormie plops down on her cot.

				MEAGAN
		I bet you're sorry you came with
		me now...

				STORMIE
		Nah... what are best friends for?
		Afterall, you stuck by me through
		all my crazy phases, I figure I
		owe you one big crazy phase, right?

				MEAGAN
		That's for being my best friend,
		Stormie.

	Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
	cell, unlocking it.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Come on, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		Where are we going?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Your parents are here.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
	where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
	Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
		Let me look at you...

				MEAGAN
		I'm okay, mom.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mother's been worried sick,
		Meagan. So have I.

	Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
	bloody and soiled.

				MEAGAN
		Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
	that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
	passes behind her.

	The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
	a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
	raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
	stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

	Stormie is fast asleep.

	Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
	the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
	jumps to her feet and screams.

				STORMIE
		Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

	But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
	respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
	licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
	forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
	pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
	self asleep.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

	She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

				FREDDY
		You know what they say... when you
		sleep -- you die!

	Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
		you helped one of those cultists
		escape from a hospital?

				MEAGAN
		A mental hospital.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And he said you desecrated a cemetery
		and some other really terrible things.
		Tell me you had nothing to do with
		it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

				MEAGAN
		There's no mistake.
			(to Murdoch)
		What did you do with Erwin?

				MURDOCH
		Your boyfriend is headed back to the
		looney bin where he belongs. But
		don't worry, you'll be seeing him
		soon enough... at the arraignment.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
	by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
	Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

				STORMIE
		You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
		to my various phases and many hours
		of watching violent televison, I
		have become immune to violence. Seen
		it all and done it all! Nothing you
		do can gross me out -- so why don't
		you give it your best shot, bitch!

				FREDDY
		Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

	Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
	defensive stance.

				STORMIE
		I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
		is a drill sergeant in the Marine
		Corps and he taught me just how to
		defend myself against slimy bastards
		like you.

				FREDDY
		Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
		Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
		I dare you!

	Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
	take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
	right in the nose.

				FREDDY
			(continuing;
				 surprised)
		Owwwww!

	Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
	fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
	breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
	She screams.

	Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
	up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
	Freddy smiles.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Now that's what I call getting a
		buzz.


	INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

	Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
	of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
	the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
	those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
	boogers.

	Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
	rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
	distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

				BOOGERMAN
		Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
		heh... get it?

	Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
	to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
		Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
		I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

	Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
	tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
	screams again.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

	Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

				MEAGAN
		We're wasting time! We've got to
		close down all the churches --
		Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
		ground!

	Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
	frightened looks.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Don't you understand?! He has to
		come to our reality to do it! It's
		our last chance to kill him!

				MURDOCH
		Okay, I think we've heard enough of
		this crap. Take her back to the
		lockup.

	A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
	and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
	watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
	daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

				MEAGAN
		Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
		I have to save Lizzy!

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
		even realize what you've done.

				MEAGAN
		I did what I had to do to try and
		save Lizzy!

				MURDOCH
		Yeah, including murdering your boy-
		friend and cutting his heart out.

				MEAGAN
		Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
		already dead when I cut his heart
		out!

	Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing; manic)
		Goddamnit, you don't understand!
		Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

	Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
	the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

				MURDOCH
		I know how you must feel... I had
		a dog once. I loved that dog. I
		treated her like my own daughter.
		We went camping, picnics in the
		park... I even had a little stocking
		for her nailed up on the mantle for
		Christmas. Then one day, she bit
		me... so I had to blow her brains
		out.
			(sighs)
		God, I loved that dog.


	INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

	Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
	knife.

	A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
	cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

				BOOGERMAN
		Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
		again -- gotta go!

	Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
	nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
	blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
	possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
	She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
	ahead.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Well, excuse me!

	INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
	his head.

	The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
	him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
	front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
	pulled out, kicking and screaming.

	Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
	closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
	twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
	man across the cell.

	Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
	ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
	flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
	his nasty head still alive in the center.

	Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
	extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
	the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
	he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
	Stormie's cell.

	Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
	right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
	of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
	clings to life deep inside the nostril.

	Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
	up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

				FREDDY
		Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

	Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
	with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
	cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
	screaming her head off.

	Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
	screams too.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

	As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
	hear a loud SPLAT!

				MEAGAN
		Stormie?!

	The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
	cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
	cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
	runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
	splattered with blood and bits.

	Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
	come running into the cellblock, answering the
	deputy's puke-choked scream.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Oh, God... what have I done? What
		have I done?!

	We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
	lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
	gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
	chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
	suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
	The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
	with a terrible SQUEAL.

	WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
	it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
	attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
	Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

				AMBULANCE DRIVER
		I'll go check it out. You stay here.

	The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
	road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
	carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
	the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
	it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
	He starts towards the ambulance.

	The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
	emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
	slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
	grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
	pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
	into the side of the ambulance.

	In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
	watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
	a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
	silence.

	RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
	and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
	weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
	eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

	Then... nothing.

	After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
	over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
	-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
	to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

				ERWIN
		You... want me to tell you where
		Meagan is?

	Again with the thrusting.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
		for a minute there I thought you
		were going to kill me.
			(then)
		You're not, are you?

	Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... okay! I'll take you right
		to her. Could you help me out of
		this?

	Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

	Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
	behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		I'll drive.

	Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
	the passenger side door.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... you drive.

	As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
	off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Fasten your safety belt, please.

	Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
	safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
	Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
	The CHIME goes crazy.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			(continuing)
		Fasten your safety belt, please...
		Fasten your safety belt, please...

	Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
	the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
	to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

				ERWIN
		Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

	With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
	ambulance roars away into the early morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

	Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
	as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
	to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
	she switches on the cellblock TV.

	ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
	is on.

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
		-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
		And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
		Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

	A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
	studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Good morning, friends... the Good
		Book says that each morning brings
		a new light into our lives...

	The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
	before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
	answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
	-- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
	commercial comes on:

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		You can own a videotape of Reverend
		Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
		$19.95...

					  CUT TO:

	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

	In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
	as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
	hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

				GATE GUARD
		Hello. What can I do for you?

	A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

				CULTIST
		We're here to see the Reverend
		Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
		wedding.

				GATE GUARD
		Do you have an appointment?

				CULTIST
		No. I have a Beretta.

	The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


	INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

	The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
	organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
	The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

	BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
	OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
	Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
	wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

	The cultists break into the control room, killing the
	DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
	garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
	Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
	All the feed monitors go snowy.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
	the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

				MEAGAN
		Something just happened at the TV
		station.

				DEPUTY
		Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

				MEAGAN
		What for?

				DEPUTY
		Time to get you cleaned up for court.

	Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
	get undressed.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
	a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
	are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
	skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
	dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
	side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
	shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
	catcall.

	Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
	to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
	over to Meagan and says:

				HEAD BITCH
		What's the matter, honey... you
		don't like our company?

				MEAGAN
		I like you... sure. It's just that
		I usually shower alone, that's all.

				HEAD BITCH
		Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
		they're shy...

	The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
	bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
	as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Don't fight it, baby! You know you
		want me...

	Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
	off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
	spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
	produces a shiv.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		If you won't give me a piece then
		I'll just cut one for myself...

	The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
	step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
	holds up her hands.

				MEAGAN
		Wait a second... I didn't mean to
		do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
		you come on a little strong, that's
		all. Just give me a little time to
		adjust to my new surroundings...

	The head bitch stops, curious.

				HEAD BITCH
		Are you saying you want me now?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I want you.

				HEAD BITCH
		Prove it.

	Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
	flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
	-- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
	the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
	long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
	bitch smiles.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Now that's more like it!
			(to the others)
		Hey, this bitch is alright!

	The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
	arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		You're okay, honey... what's your
		name?

				MEAGAN
		Meagan.

				HEAD BITCH
		So... what're you in for, Meagan?

				MEAGAN
			(sniffles a little)
		Oh, my friend...

				HEAD BITCH
		The bitch that died last night?

				MEAGAN
			(starts to cry)
		Yeah... they said she had some
		disease that made her... explode!
		Oh, God! Please hold me!

	The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
	smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
	of concern as one asks:

				BITCH #1
		What's this bullshit about some
		killer funk make you explode?

				HEAD BITCH
			(to Meagan)
		Easy... honey. It's goin' be
		alright. But what I asked you is
		why you're in here?

				MEAGAN
		Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
		think I gave it to her...

	The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
	were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
	but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
	the bitches race for the exit.

	The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
	shouts:

				DEPUTY
		What the hell is all the screaming
		about?!

	WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
	from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
	running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
	After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
	drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

	The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
	through the station.  Several deputies chase after
	them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
	ensues.  Chaos.

	Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
	up at the madness and mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks...


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
	on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
	The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
	head with her baton and she falls to the side,
	revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
	uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

	The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
	sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
	her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
	leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
	face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

	On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
	charging into the showers to restore order.  She
	gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
	to freedom.


	EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
	up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
	pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
	and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

				JUNIOR TROOPER
		Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

					 CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
	shakes his head, saying:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		I won't do it! It's a sin!
		Blasphemy!

	One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

				CULTIST
		Wedding or funeral... your choice.

	The reverend swallows and says:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And who would be the bride?

	Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
	and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
	lulls around as she chants softly:

				LIZZY
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
	needle from one to another.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Three... four... Better lock your
		door.

	The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
	throat.  He shudders and asks:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And the groom.

				CULTIST
		He's coming...

	Lizzy is almost asleep.

				LIZZY
		Five... six... grab your crucifix...

	The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
	Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
	falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
	an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
	the curtains on FIRE.

	As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
	appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
	leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
	to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

				FREDDY
		That's for the lift sister!
			(to the cultists)
		Hiya, kids!

				CULTISTS
			(in unison)
		Hiya, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Ready to get hitched?

				CULTISTS
		Ready, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Then let's do it!

	Lizzy looks up and smiles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Freddy...

					  CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

	A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

				DEPUTY
		We found your patrol car, Captain.
		It was abandoned near a local
		religious station.

				MURDOCH
		Religious station? Is there a
		padre there?

				DEPUTY
		Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
		casts out of that location.

				MURDOCH
		So that's where they're hiding.

					  CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		...and if there be anyone among you
		who has any reason why these two
		should not be joined in holy...

	Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
			(continuing)
		...in matrimony. Let them speak
		now...
			(under his breath)
		...please God...
			(aloud)
		...or forever hold their peace.

	WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

				MEAGAN
		Stop!

	Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing;
				 to Freddy)
		Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

				FREDDY
		You're a virgin?!

				MEAGAN
		Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

	Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
	around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

				FREDDY
		Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
		than your retard sister... okay,
		you've got the job.
			(to cultists)
		Get her ready.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

	Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
	station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
	the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
	out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
	and says:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
		State Trooper. I'm giving you until
		the count of three to come out with
		your hands up...

	A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
	hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
	other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
	calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Hand me that flare pistol.

	The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Good idea. Throw a little light on
		them -- see if we can spot their
		firing positions...

	As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
	carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
	to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
	He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
	screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
	commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright, now I'm through playing
		"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
		you punks to come out right now
		with your hands up.

	The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
	-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
	and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
	EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

	The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
	dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
	beside Freddy.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

	As the battle outside between the cultists and the
	cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
	down behind a fender to reload.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Well, it doesn't look like they're
		going to surrender.

				MURDOCH
		What we're going to need then is
		somebody to charge their lines --
		make a hole for us to slip in.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Where are you going to find anyone
		that crazy?

	Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
	police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

				MURDOCH
		Here comes one now...
			(yells)
		GO GIT 'EM, SON!

	Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
	Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
	side window as the ambulance zooms past.

	Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
	the ambulance.

	The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
	SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
	through the front gate.

	Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
	the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

				ERWIN
		That was easy enough...

	Erwin looks ahead and screams.

	ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
	directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
	machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
	ducks down.

	Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
	ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
	into the side of the station with a CRASH.

	Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
	cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
	smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
	machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
	the cultist just in time.

	As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
	greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
	OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
	punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
	Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
	Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
	towards the front door.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The wedding proceeds...

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Once again... if there be anyone
		among you who does not want these
		two people to be joined... let him
		speak now or forever hold his peace.

	Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
	reverend clears his throat to continue when...

	WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
	in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

				FREDDY
		Uh, oh...

	The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
	one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
	a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
	idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
	machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
	as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
	on the other side start POUNDING.

	Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
	slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
	it falls to the floor.

	Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
	behind him.

	Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
	wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
	looks up and says:

				ERWIN
		I can't wake them up. Freddy's
		got them trapped!

	Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
	couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
	Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
	of dream dope.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Go get him, boy!

	Jason staggers forward, falling into...


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
	entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
	head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
	the LIVING DEAD.

	Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
	shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

	Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
	boxing gloves.

	TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

				TED BUNDY
			(into microphone)
		Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
		to the fight of the century! I'm
		your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

	BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
	BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
	and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
	back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
	calls into the balcony:

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

	ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
	smoking.

				OSWALD
			(angry; defensive)
		It wasn't me!

	Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

				TED BUNDY
		In my left corner, weighing in at
		only ninety seven pounds... the
		nightmare master himself! The one!
		The only... Freddddddddy
		Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

	Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And on my right... weighing in at
		a whopping four hundred and thir-
		teen pounds... that killer of
		countless teenagers... the big
		guy...
			(gestures to Jason)
		Jason Voorhees!

	CHEERS and BOOS.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And the prize tonight... not one but
		TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
		ripe for the picking.

	Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
	Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Hey, have one now and save the other
		for the ride home. That's what I did.

	LAUGHTER from the crowd.

				MEAGAN
		Kick his ass, Jason!

	DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

	Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
	blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
	glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
	RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

	Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
	axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
	over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
	her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

				BLOODY MARY
		HEY!

	Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
	OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
	down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
	and shrugs:

				FREDDY
		Oh, well... I just axed for that!

	Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
	Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
	axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
	between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
	turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

				HITLER
		Peasants...

	DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
	into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
	his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
	starts in:

				HUMAN HEAD
		That's it, kiddo! You're really
		giving it to him out there! Use the
		left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
		That's the ticket to a knockout!

	Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
	the studio door.


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

	DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
	Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
	each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
	Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
	a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
	OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
	CHEERS.

	Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
	opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
	decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
	of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

	Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
	disgust.

	Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
	high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
	to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

	Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
	Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
	can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
	opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
	and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
	his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
	chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
	heavy metal boxing glove.

	Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
	massive glove for a blow.

	CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
	glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
	He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

	As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
	around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
	into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
	see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
	Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

	>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! Get up! Get up!

	ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
	water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
	up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
	wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

	Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
	Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
	the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jason! You've got to get up!

	JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
	him down... drowning him...

						  FLASH CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
	to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

	Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
	his killer comes into sharp focus.

	It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
	reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
	Jason down again, laughing.

						  HARD CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

	Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
	mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
	of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
	mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
	him up with him.

	Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
	ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


	INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
	he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
	the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
	pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
	real world.

				FREDDY
		Oh, shit!

	Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
	boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
	tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

	Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
	They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
	suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
	-- dead.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

	The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
	police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
	heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
	sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

				MURDOCH
		Now's my chance... give me sixty
		seconds to get in there then move
		in.

	Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
	running into the station.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
	and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

				MEAGAN
		What took you so long?!

	Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
	so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

				ERWIN
		What ever you do... don't let this
		guy drive.

	Meagan smiles at Jason.

				MEAGAN
		I knew you would come...

	Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
	fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
	scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

	The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
	then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
	disappear.

	In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
	monitor, laughing.

				ERWIN
		Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

	Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
	from the control room via a long thick cable running
	overhead.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		He's going for the satellite dish!
		If he uplinks with a communications
		satellite he can beam himself any-
		where in the world! We'll never be
		rid of him!

	Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
	past them, going through the ceiling to the...


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
	to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
	ready to beam Freddy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
	hard.


	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
	BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


	EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

	The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
	off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
	tumbling into deep space.

	The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

	Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
	and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
	skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
	One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

	ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
	solar prominence.


	INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
	a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
	dust billows up.

	Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
	Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
	this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

				ERWIN
		No! Wait!

	Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
	the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
	run to his side.

	Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
	chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
	out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin? Erwin?!

				MURDOCH
		He's dead... and so are you if you
		don't put your hands up right now!

	Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
	the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
	as he says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		It's time I taught you girls some
		respect for the law!

	In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
	cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

	PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
	SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
	large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
	turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		So... you wanna be a punk?

	Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Then die like a punk!

	Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
	hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
	jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
	pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
	with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
	see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

	As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
	hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
	of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
	muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
	the shotgun and...

	BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
	his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
	of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
	metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
	spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

	Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
	floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
	come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
	guns in panic.

				MEAGAN
		NO!

	Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
	FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
	grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
	past.

	More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
	start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
	is crowded with muzzle flash.

	More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
	hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

	The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
	up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

	VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
	opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
	passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
	cops in the studio.

	Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
	off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
	to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
	of his chest and head.

	Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
	SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
	the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
	gunsmoke in the room.

	As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
	then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

	Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
	reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
	pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

	Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
	rolls back -- he's dead.

	Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
	revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
	Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
	turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

				LIZZY
		You forgot to check under the bed.

	Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
	-- nada.

				MEAGAN
		No monsters here.

				LIZZY
		But what if they come back?

				MEAGAN
		Then we'll just have to kick their
		ass again.

	Lizzy giggles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		I love you too. Go to sleep.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
	to her from the bottom of the staircase.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Meagan?

	Meagan looks down at her parents.

				MEAGAN
		Yes, dad?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mom and I... well, we want to
		thank you for saving your sister's
		life... we know you went through
		a lot.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're going to be there for you
		from now on... for both of you!
		And that nice lawyer we hired for
		you said he thinks he can get all
		the charges dropped... except maybe
		for the grave robbing and human
		desecration ones.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Everything is going to be fine.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And I'm going to get sober...

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		We're going to be a normal, happy
		family again.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

				MEAGAN
		Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Goodnight, Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
	when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

				MEAGAN
		Hello?

				FREDDY
			(filtered)
		I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

	Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
	licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
	phone down.

				MEAGAN
			(sighs)
		I know...

	Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
	climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
	the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
	and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

					 BLACKNESS:

	The phone RINGS.

	ROLL END CREDITS:

	Then... at the very end...

					 CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

	Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
	the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
	when they went back to reality... waiting.

	Finally, somebody says:

				MONSTER
		I don't think they're coming back.

				TED BUNDY
		Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
		body can go home now.

	All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

					 CUT TO:

	BLACK... now it's over.

				THE END

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               INT. TRIBECA LOFT - DAY

               The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts 
               of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie 
               netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and 
               disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions.

               Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky 
               light. We see hints of a huge demolished space.

               An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips 
               of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard 
               dimly in the distance.

               With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes 
               out of nowhere. The wall shudders.

               HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. 
               The wall buckles.

               Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new 
               swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. 
               Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the 
               atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of 
               wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the 
               air. We hear voices talking.

                                     MOLLY (O.S.)
                         What a mess!

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         I told you!

               Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on 
               the other side of the wall, all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS.

                                     SAM
                         I can't breathe.

                                     MOLLY
                         Use your mask, dummy.

               One of the figures adjusts something over his face. Isolated 
               rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in 
               the air.

                                     SAM
                              (singing)
                         "Volga boat..., man." Whoomph!

               His hammer pounds the wall. Molly laughs.

               ANGLE

               The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY 
               JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and 
               a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her 
               eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his 
               late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong 
               forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his 
               brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, 
               removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a 
               fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light 
               penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see 
               a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with 
               something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, 
               a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge 
               clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam, look, there's a whole eight 
                         feet up there.

                                     SAM
                         And about eighty years of dust.

                                     MOLLY
                         We have all this height, Sam. We 
                         could add a second floor and put our 
                         bedroom upstairs. That would leave 
                         all this space.

                                     SAM
                              (eyeing her curiously)
                         For what?

                                     MOLLY
                         For space. Just space.

                                     SAM
                         Be great for bumper cars.

               Carl laughs as he looks at Sam. Their bodies, covered with 
               white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.

                                     CARL
                         Sam, this may be none of my business, 
                         but I'm concerned you're doing too 
                         much coke.

               Sam glances down at his white body. They all laugh.

                                     MOLLY
                         Hey, Sam, turn around.

               Sam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and 
               the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick, 
               accomplished, and subtly erotic.

                                     CARL
                              (offering his body)
                         How 'bout me?

               Molly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female 
               torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches 
               it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a 
               Greek statue.

                                     CARL
                         I'll never wash again.

               Molly laughs.

               ANGLE

               Sam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers. Molly 
               begins to count.

                                     MOLLY
                         All together now. One,
                              (they strike the wall 
                              with their hammers. 
                              The wall shakes)
                         two,
                              (they pound again. 
                              The wall begins to 
                              give)
                         three.

               In unison, they hit it once more. A massive section of plaster 
               and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the 
               air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. 
               Something rattles inside it, a penny.

                                     SAM
                         Hey, look what I found. There's a 
                         penny inside.
                              (he hands it to Molly)
                         For luck in our new loft. It's a 
                         good omen.

                                     MOLLY
                              (shaking her head, 
                              disagreeing)
                         You're the good omen.

               She glances at him lovingly. Carl looks at the two of them 
               and grins.

               As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines 
               of the space they are working in. It is a huge loft over 
               four thousand square feet. Banks of windows run east and 
               west. Molly steps back and admires the room.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's gorgeous.

                                     CARL
                         You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you 
                         could sell it tomorrow and double 
                         your investment.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sell it? Carl, we just bought it.

                                     CARL
                         What I wouldn't do for a place like 
                         this.

                                     SAM
                         It's gonna be great.

               OMITTED

               EXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               It is morning rush hour. Sam and Carl, both wearing suits 
               and ties, exit the Wall Street subway station and approach 
               the Headquarters of Market Security Bank & Trust.

                                     CARL
                         Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move 
                         your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so 
                         you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He 
                         called yesterday and said he has to 
                         see you today about the Danway stuff. 
                         Three o'clock was the only time he 
                         could make it. Also, the board meeting 
                         in L.A. has been confirmed for the 
                         12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.

               Sam seems preoccupied.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain 
                         surgery you're going into.

                                     SAM
                         I hate pitching to these Japanese 
                         guys. They make me nervous. I mean, 
                         what am I supposed to say, "Who do 
                         you think'll win that big Sumo 
                         championship"?

                                     CARL
                         Sam, you'll be fine. You're great 
                         with people.

               Sam's jacket flares open. He is wearing yellow suspenders. 
               Carl notices.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Hey, nice. I like those.

               Sam, not completely comfortable wearing them, buttons his 
               jacket.

                                     SAM
                         ...Molly.

               Carl smiles and then turns to admire a car going by.

                                     CARL
                         Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa. 
                         That's the car I'm gonna drive when 
                         I'm making two hundred grand.

                                     SAM
                         Better pay off your Mustang first.

               INT. BANK HEADQUARTERS, ELEVATOR - DAY

               Sam and Carl are standing on a crowded elevator. It is deadly 
               quiet. Suddenly Carl elbows Sam and winks. There is something 
               he wants him to do. Sam hesitates a moment, annoyed, and 
               then relents. He clears his throat.

                                     SAM
                         So Carl, what did the doctor say?

                                     CARL
                         He said it was contagious. Very 
                         contagious. I shouldn't be going 
                         into work today.
                              (he coughs loudly)
                         But what could I do?

               He sneezes. People on the elevator freeze.

                                     SAM
                         And what about the rash?

                                     CARL
                         Not good. It's spreading everywhere.

                                     SAM
                         On your genitals again?

                                     CARL
                         Everywhere. He said be sure not to 
                         touch anyone.

               We see people trying to inch away. Carl coughs again. They 
               hold their breath. The elevator stops at the next floor. All 
               the passengers get off.

               INT. BANK HEADQUARTERS, EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY

               Sam and Carl, laughing, walk through a large office area 
               bustling with activity. Employees, in various cubicles, are 
               talking on telephones and punching information into computers.

               Sam heads into his executive office. Carl steps into a cubicle 
               across the aisle. ROSE, Sam's secretary, approaches him.

                                     ROSE
                         Morning, Mr. Wheat.

                                     SAM
                         Morning Rose. Listen, when the 
                         Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore 
                         take them right to the...

                                     ROSE
                         They're already here.

               She points to a windowed conference room. Sam turns around 
               and sees a large group of JAPANESE MEN standing inside.

                                     SAM
                         They're early!

                                     ROSE
                         I know. And Andy Dillon called. He 
                         said they need $900,000 transferred 
                         to Albany by noon.

                                     SAM
                         Noon? Damn!

               He hurries over to Carl's cubicle. He is on the phone. Carl 
               cups the mouthpiece.

                                     CARL
                         Hold on.

                                     SAM
                         Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in 
                         Albany by noon. Can you transfer it 
                         to his payroll account?

                                     CARL
                         Sure. Just let me have your MAC code.

               Sam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book. 
               He jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to 
               Carl.

                                     SAM
                         Discretion, huh?

                                     CARL
                         You bet. I'll do it right away.

               INT. WELL-APPOINTED EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - DAY

               Sam and a group of fifteen somber Japanese businessmen are 
               sitting around a large granite conference table. Sam stands 
               up and speaks a simple greeting to them.

                                     SAM
                              (in Japanese)
                         Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf 
                         of Market Security Bank & Trust, I 
                         welcome you to our city.

               The men smile happily and nod their heads in unison.

                                     MEN
                         Arigato.

               They look to Sam, expecting more. Uncomfortable, he clears 
               his throat.

                                     SAM
                         I'm afraid that's the only Japanese 
                         I know. But I realize it's not our 
                         language fluency, or lack of it, 
                         that brings you to Market Security. 
                         Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking 
                         expertise, our ability to represent 
                         and anticipate all of your banking 
                         needs. As you know, we are not the 
                         largest banking establishment in New 
                         York.
                              (his throat goes dry 
                              and he takes a sip 
                              of water)
                         But, with combined assets of over 
                         200 billion dollars, we have a firm 
                         commitment to the international 
                         marketplace.

               A SECRETARY enters the room and hands Sam a piece of paper. 
               It reads "MOLLY ON LINE 2. URGENT." She hands him a phone.

               Sam looks surprised. He nods apologetically to his guests.

                                     SAM
                         Excuse me.
                              (he picks up the 
                              receiver)
                         Hello?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOLLY

               dressed in a long, clay covered smock. She is in a potters 
               studio. SEVERAL OTHER POTTERS are in the background working 
               at their wheels. A five-foot high ceramic vase stands beside 
               Molly. It is still wet. She toys with it as she speaks into 
               the phone.

                                     MOLLY
                         A man and a woman are lying in bed 
                         when the woman's husband suddenly 
                         comes home. Frightened, she tells 
                         the man he has to leave instantly 
                         through the window. He has no time 
                         to dress.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               SAM

               straight-faced, listening and trying to look as if it is 
               important.

                                     SAM
                         Uh hmm.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         It's raining outside. The man, running 
                         naked along the street, sees some 
                         joggers approaching.

               The entire contingent of Japanese men is staring at Sam.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                              (continuing)
                         One of the joggers calls out. "Hey, 
                         do you always go jogging naked?" And 
                         the man says, "Yes, always."

                                     SAM
                         Okay.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         And then the other jogger says, "And 
                         do you always wear a condom?" The 
                         man looks down, embarrassed, and 
                         replies, "Only when it's raining."

               Sam squelches a smile.

                                     SAM
                         Well, that's just fine.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         Now just relax and have fun, okay? 
                         It's not the end of the world if you 
                         lose this account. You've always got 
                         me.

                                     SAM
                         Thank you. I'll remember that.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         See ya.

               He hangs up and stares at the Japanese men. A short smile 
               crosses his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A CARVED WOODEN ANGEL

               eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. As the 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK we see that we are inside a building and 
               that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above 
               the street.

               A group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty 
               bringing it in. Suddenly Molly steps INTO the FRAME.

                                     MOLLY
                         Where you guys from, the New York 
                         City Ballet?

               With a gutsy maneuver, Molly leans out over the sidewalk and 
               tries to grab hold of the ropes. She can't reach them. 
               Suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist. She 
               screams.

                                     SAM
                         Saved your life.

               Sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft. She does not 
               think it is funny.

                                     MOLLY
                         You bastard. Don't do that to me. 
                         You scared me half to death.

                                     SAM
                         Better than seeing this gorgeous 
                         body splattered all over the street. 
                         Here, look out.

               Sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings 
               out over the sidewalk. Molly gasps. Sam's feet push at the 
               angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the 
               loft. Quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it 
               in. The workmen applaud. Molly eyes him with admiration.

               Suddenly we hear a voice call out.

                                     CARL (O.S.)
                         Sam? Molly? Anybody home?

               Molly looks to Sam.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl? Did you invite him?

                                     SAM
                              (under his breath)
                         I couldn't keep him away.

               Carl enters, shakes Molly's hand, and pats Sam on the back.

                                     CARL
                         Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin?

               Before they can answer, a WORKMAN turns to Molly.

                                     WORKMAN (V.O.)
                         Where do you want this?

                                     MOLLY
                         In the bedroom.

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               As the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly 
               decorated loft for the first time. It is painted now in lovely 
               pastels. The floor, a huge gymnasium-like expanse, is 
               lacquered with polyurethane. Furniture and boxes are piling 
               up along the walls. Dominating the space, with a kind of 
               surreal presence, are a large number of Molly's sculptures 
               and ceramics. There is also a vintage jukebox. Carl is 
               impressed.

                                     CARL
                         Wow! The place looks great. Really 
                         great.

                                     MOLLY
                         You like it, huh?

                                     CARL
                         "Like" is hardly the word. I never 
                         imagined it would be this beautiful. 
                         This is incredible.

               A mover lugs in a heavy old chair. Molly sees it.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam, you kept that chair?

                                     SAM
                         What do you mean? It's comfortable. 
                         For T.V. I love that chair.

                                     MOLLY
                         But it doesn't go with anything.

                                     SAM
                         It goes with me.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's okay, I'll paint it.

               Sam pinches her ass. Molly smiles.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

               Sam, Molly, and Carl are sprawled out on the floor, eating 
               from Cartons of Chinese food. Frank, a gray cat, eats beside 
               them. Unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere.

                                     SAM
                         It was the middle of December. I was 
                         sitting in my old office, the one 
                         Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this 
                         woman screaming. I thought someone'd 
                         been shot or something.

                                     MOLLY
                         They took away my MasterCard. It was 
                         Christmas, for godssake.

                                     SAM
                         She was four thousand dollars over 
                         her limit.

                                     MOLLY
                         It wasn't four thousand. And I'd 
                         already sent in the payment! You're 
                         the ones that lost it.

                                     SAM
                         She's still angry.

                                     MOLLY
                         No I'm not.

               The cat begins nibbling Sam's food.

                                     SAM
                         Get outta here, Frank!
                              (the cat scampers 
                              away)
                         You should have seen her. All pink 
                         and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous, 
                         like a rose. And she's screaming, 
                         demanding to see the president. So 
                         Wilton brought her to me.

                                     CARL
                         You? You weren't even a VP yet.

                                     SAM
                         She didn't know that.

               Carl smiles.

                                     MOLLY
                         Can you believe it? And the next 
                         thing I know, he's telling me his 
                         life story. I couldn't believe it. 
                         Everything. About his divorce, how 
                         he'd just arrived in New York, how 
                         he didn't know any women. And all 
                         with this Montana accent.

                                     SAM
                         What's a Montana accent?

                                     MOLLY
                         The one you always slip into it when 
                         you get nervous. "Yes, Ma'am. Thank 
                         you, Ma'am. Can I fondle your breasts, 
                         Ma'am?"

                                     SAM
                              (laughing)
                         I wasn't nervous.

                                     MOLLY
                         Admit it. You liked me. You were 
                         interested.

                                     SAM
                              (matter of factly)
                         I thought you were cute.

                                     MOLLY
                         Cute?
                              (looking at Carl)
                         Do you believe this? I should have 
                         been Picasso's mistress. I should 
                         have been living in Barcelona or 
                         Paris. But no, I'm moving in with a 
                         New York banker who thinks I'm cute.

               She looks at Sam and grins. Carl is staring at Molly, 
               obviously turned on by her. He is embarrassed when she catches 
               his gaze and quickly looks away.

               OMITTED

               INT. MOLLY'S STUDIO - NIGHT

               Molly, dressed only in a T-shirt, is sitting at her potters 
               wheel throwing a series of pots. Sam enters the studio. He 
               is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans.

                                     SAM
                         What are you doing?

                                     MOLLY
                         I felt inspired.

                                     SAM
                         At 2:00 am?

               She nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in 
               front of her. Sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, 
               molding and forming the clay. She is forceful, assured, 
               gifted. The clay responds to her slightest effort. Slowly, 
               almost unconsciously, Sam reaches for her shoulders and begins 
               kissing them.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         You notice Carl's eyes today? They 
                         were all over you.

                                     MOLLY
                         What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me 
                         tell you something. He's not even 
                         looking at me. It's you he idolizes. 
                         He doesn't see me at all... Anyway, 
                         he's not my type.

               Sam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay. 
               Molly looks up at him.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         What are you doing?

                                     SAM
                         I feel inspired.

               His hands dig into the clay. Molly smiles. Their fingers 
               seem to dance together. After a moment, she reaches up to 
               him, her clay-covered fingers streaking his face and curving 
               down to his chest. Sam grins and reaches down to her.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               SAM'S FINGER

               as it presses two buttons on his jukebox. We watch as the 
               mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers 
               it to the turntable. The arm hovers over the record and then 
               descends. It begins to play. The song is "Unchained Melody" 
               by the Righteous Brothers.

               SAM AND MOLLY

               are dancing in the middle of the dark loft. Moonlight pours 
               through the windows and shines off the floor. Wads of packing 
               paper swirl sensuously around their feet.

               Molly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back. The moment is 
               sweet and erotic. We watch as Sam slowly draws his fingers 
               down over Molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her 
               eyes, her lips.

               Sam slides his hands under Molly's T-shirt, slowly moving 
               them toward her breasts. Her breathing slows. They dance 
               silently, her hair swaying in the soft light.

               We hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished 
               floor.

               Sensuously, Molly's shirt lifts above her navel as Sam presses 
               into her. Their stomachs touch and part and touch again. She 
               bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his 
               chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the 
               curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his 
               jeans.

               Sam leans into Molly and nips at her neck. She stops dancing. 
               Her eyes close. She stands absolutely still. Sam's hands 
               move to her backside. He pulls her closer.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               SAM AND MOLLY, making love on the livingroom carpet. Paper 
               and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across 
               the floor. For all their sensuality, it is their hands and 
               eyes that are most expressive, revealing a tenderness that 
               is deeply moving. Their lovemaking is full of love.

               JUKEBOX

               The song ends. The jukebox arm retracts and gently slides 
               the record back into its slot.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               OMITTED

               BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sam and Molly are lying together silently. Molly gazes at 
               him.

                                     MOLLY
                         What's the matter?

                                     SAM
                         The matter?

                                     MOLLY
                         I can tell.

                                     SAM
                         Nothing... really.

                                     MOLLY
                         You're worried, aren't you? About 
                         moving in together?

                                     SAM
                         No. Not really.

                                     MOLLY
                         Then what? The promotion?

                                     SAM
                         I don't know. A lot of things. I 
                         just don't want the bubble to burst... 
                         Whenever something good happens to 
                         me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose 
                         it.

               Molly gently strokes his head.

                                     MOLLY
                         You know what?

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     MOLLY
                         I love you. I really love you.

               He smiles and strokes her cheek.

                                     SAM
                         Ditto.

               Suddenly the T.V. blares into the room. Sam jumps up, grabbing 
               the remote control unit from under his buttocks. Molly laughs 
               as he turns the SOUND DOWN. The news is on and they are 
               showing the remains of an airline disaster. Sam stares at 
               the tube.

                                     SAM
                         Oh Jesus. Another one.

                                     MOLLY
                         Don't watch that stuff.

               He motions to wait. Dead bodies litter the screen.

                                     CORRESPONDENT
                         ...It is estimated that 34 people 
                         died in the crash, the second in 
                         less than two weeks.

               The T.V. goes OFF. Sam, confused, spins around. Molly is 
               holding the remote control. She nods for him to lie down.

                                     SAM
                         I should cancel my L.A. trip... These 
                         things always happen in threes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides, 
                         you lead a charmed life.

                                     SAM
                         Yeah. So did they.

               Sam looks at her and then back at the screen.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Amazing, huh?
                              (he snaps his fingers)
                         Just like that. Blackout.

               EXT. WALL STREET ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

               OMITTED

               INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sam is sitting at his computer. His address book with his 
               access codes is sitting open beside him. He seems perplexed 
               by something happening on the screen. After pushing a series 
               of buttons and getting the same response, he whacks the 
               computer on the side. Carl, walking in the door, sees him. 
               Sam looks up sheepishly.

                                     SAM
                         A glitch. What's up?

                                     CARL
                         The Mark Greenberg and Larry White 
                         accounts. I can't get in. Your MAC 
                         code doesn't work.

                                     SAM
                         I changed it.

                                     CARL
                         Why? What's up?

                                     SAM
                         Nothing. I just want to nose around 
                         a bit... Can you keep your mouth 
                         shut?

                                     CARL
                         Yeah, sure. Tell me, what's going 
                         on.

                                     SAM
                         I think I've stumbled onto something. 
                         There's too much money in these 
                         accounts.

                                     CARL
                         Too much money. That's ridiculous. 
                         How could there be too much money?

                                     SAM
                         That's what I keep asking myself.

                                     CARL
                         It must be the computer.

                                     SAM
                         I've been checking.

                                     CARL
                         Yeah, Mr. Fixit.
                              (he hits the computer 
                              like Sam did and 
                              laughs)
                         Come on, move over. Let me see what 
                         I can do.

                                     SAM
                         Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit.

                                     CARL
                         Okay, okay. Just call me when you're 
                         ready for help.
                              (he heads for the 
                              door)
                         So, what are you and Moll doing 
                         tonight?

                                     SAM
                         We're going to the theatre. She wants 
                         to see "Macbeth" at the Spring Street 
                         Repertory.

               Carl winces. Sam smiles.

               INT. SPRING STREET REPERTORY - NIGHT

               Sam and Molly are sitting in the fifth row of a crowded 
               auditorium. He is sound asleep.

               ANGLE STAGE

               A scene from "Macbeth".

               Sam begins to snore. Molly grabs his nose. He jerks awake. 
               Molly grins.

               EXT. SPRING STREET REPERTORY - NIGHT

               Bright marquee lights sparkle overhead as Sam and Molly exit 
               the theatre. It is a beautiful brisk night.

                                     SAM
                         I loved it.

                                     MOLLY
                         I could tell.

               She smiles and squeezes his arm. They walk silently down a 
               dark street, heading toward their loft. The pavement is full 
               of shadows.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Did I tell you what Marcia said?

                                     SAM
                         Six times.

                                     MOLLY
                         Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so 
                         blasé. I'll have two major pieces in 
                         the show. The New York Times reviews 
                         her gallery all the time. This could 
                         be huge.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, the "New York Times" is some 
                         frustrated little critic with pimples 
                         on his ass who flunked out of art 
                         school. Who cares what The New York 
                         Times thinks?

                                     MOLLY
                         Eight million readers, that's who.

                                     SAM
                         Your work's beautiful. That's a fact, 
                         Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone 
                         thinks.

               We can tell from the expression on Molly's face that it does. 
               Sam puts his arm around her. She nestles close to him. Then, 
               suddenly, she stops and looks up. There is an unexpected 
               seriousness in her voice.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         I want to marry you, Sam.

                                     SAM
                              (taken aback)
                         What?

                                     MOLLY
                         I've been thinking about it for days. 
                         More than thinking. I want to do it. 
                         I want to jump in whole hog...
                              (she pauses)
                         What is that look for?

                                     SAM
                              (staring at her)
                         It's just been so long since... I 
                         mean, you never wanted to talk about 
                         it.

               There is a long pause.

                                     MOLLY
                         Do you love me, Sam?

                                     SAM
                         What do you think, Moll?

                                     MOLLY
                         How come you never say it?

                                     SAM
                         What are you talking about?

                                     MOLLY
                         You say "ditto". It's not the same.

                                     SAM
                         People say "I love you" all the time. 
                         It doesn't mean anything.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sometimes you need to hear it.

               Sam stops and stares at Molly. He pauses quietly. He is about 
               to speak when A MAN'S FACE emerges from the shadows behind 
               him. Molly gasps. Sam spins around.

               AN INTENSE LOOKING MAN

               is standing in the darkness between two buildings. He stares 
               at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk. 
               Sam and Molly stand motionless. The man hesitates and then 
               begins walking the other way. Molly exhales a deep breath.

               Sam takes Molly's arm and they continue briskly down the 
               street. Suddenly they hear FOOTSTEPS coming after them.

                                     MOLLY
                         What should we do?

                                     SAM
                         Let me handle this.

               Sam stops abruptly and turns around. A gun is staring him in 
               the face. Molly screams.

                                     WILLIE
                         Your wallet!

               Sam waits a beat.

                                     MOLLY
                         Give it to him!

               Sam reaches for his jacket. The Mugger grabs his wrist and 
               then carefully pulls the wallet out himself.

                                     SAM
                         Take the money. Just leave the wallet 
                         and my...

               He swipes Sam across the head. Molly screams. The Mugger 
               whacks her across the face. Sam explodes, plowing into the 
               mugger with all his might.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam, No!

               There is a wild, all out brawl. Sam fights like a mad man. 
               Suddenly the GUN goes off. The Mugger panics and takes off 
               running. Sam charges after him.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam!!!!!

               The two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is 
               already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows.

               Sam gives up. Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward 
               Molly.

               We can see Molly dimly at the end of the block as Sam 
               approaches. She is screaming for help. Frightened, Sam calls 
               out.

                                     SAM
                         Molly!

               She doesn't answer. Sam tenses and starts running toward 
               her. He is just three feet away when suddenly he stops. An 
               expression of pure terror overwhelms his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSEUP - MOLLY

               drenched in blood. Her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock. 
               Panting, she stoops down to the curb as THE CAMERA TRAVELS 
               WITH HER. She grabs hold of something lying in the shadows 
               and pulls it toward her.

               It is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms.

               Sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands 
               beside Molly. His eyes are awash in horror and confusion. He 
               seems unable to move. THE CAMERA HOLDS on his face as the 
               full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes.

               Suddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream.

                                     SAM
                         No!!!!!!

               He jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold 
               of his motionless form. His hands make a strange SOUND as 
               they pass right though it. It is terrifying. Sam jumps up, 
               crazed, frenzied, and begins circling Molly. It is as though 
               he is trying to undo what has been done.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         This isn't happening. It's not 
                         happening.

               He reaches out to Molly for help. His hand cuts through her 
               shoulder. He screams.

               FOOTSTEPS. People are running down the street. The sound of 
               SIRENS can be heard in the distance. Two MEN run toward Sam. 
               He yells out at them.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Help me!

               They run right through him. He gasps in stunned terror.

               Sam watches helplessly as they reach his body. Molly looks 
               up and begins screaming hysterically. One of the Men grabs 
               her as the other goes for Sam's wrist. There is no sign of 
               life.

               The first Man holds Molly back as his friend stoops down and 
               begins some form of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There is 
               no response. Sam bends down, trying desperately to help. It 
               is a futile gesture.

                                     SAM
                         Do it! Do it!

               The Man bangs on Sam's chest. Blood gushes from the wound. 
               Molly recoils. He bangs again.

                                                           CUT ABRUPTLY TO:

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Sam shoots up in bed, panting. It is dark. He stares around 
               the loft in sudden confusion. With a lurch he flicks on the 
               night light. Molly is lying beside him, her head buried 
               beneath a pillow. Sam seems stunned.

                                     SAM
                         Molly? Molly!

               Tears stream down his face. Molly stirs.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam? What's the matter? Is something 
                         wrong?

                                     SAM
                         Molly!

               Sam is so relieved to hear her voice that he can hardly 
               breathe.

                                     MOLLY
                         What is it, honey?

               Molly, groggy, tries to sit up. Sam reaches out for her.

               As she turns around, we see A SKELETEL VERSION OF HER HEAD 
               staring at the camera. It speaks.

                                     MOLLY
                              (mocking him)
                         What is it, honey?

               Sam bolts upright, screaming. It is a scream so consumed by 
               terror that one fears it will never stop.

                                                       CUT UNEXPECTEDLY TO:

               CLOSE-UP OF SAM

               asleep in bed. He is thrashing at his pillow and moaning.

               Suddenly, a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder. Sam 
               jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               Molly is sitting on the bed looking at him, afraid.

               Sam stares down at her. He is breathing heavily, not trusting 
               his own senses. His hands clutch at the wall.

                                     SAM
                         What's happening to me?!

               ANGLE

               Suddenly, a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a 
               host of glowing forms, radiating an intense inner light, 
               float before us. A blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite 
               vortex behind them. Sam is awed and confused. We sense that 
               the light is enchanting him. The entire room begins to 
               disappear in the light.

               Molly screams.

                                     MOLLY
                         Don't leave me. I need you, Sam.

               ANGLE

               Sam turns and sees Molly, only she is not in the bed. She is 
               back on the street. To his amazement, he is on the street, 
               too, still bathed in the soothing light. Frightened, he calls 
               out to her.

                                     SAM
                         Molly!

               She does not hear him. He calls again.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Molly.

               There is no response. Sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a 
               moment. He is torn between Molly and the light. Then, in a 
               painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and 
               walks toward Molly. At that instant, the light behind him 
               disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing. There 
               is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates 
               into the void. Sam is left on the dark pavement. He stands 
               there a moment, as if in shock, and then begins running toward 
               Molly. An AMBULANCE is rounding the corner.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

               Swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights 
               and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush. The SIREN 
               wails into the night.

               INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

               Sam's body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a 
               PARAMEDIC applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort 
               to save him. After a moment, he looks up at Molly. We can 
               tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless. 
               Sam yells.

                                     SAM
                         Don't stop! I'm not dead!

               Molly, kneeling over Sam's body, grabs him and begins to cry 
               in long terrible sobs.

               INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

               A DOCTOR, comforting Molly, accompanies her from one of the 
               emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of 
               swinging doors into a separate waiting area. We see TWO 
               POLICEMEN and TWO DETECTIVES stand up and approach her.

               Sam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but 
               then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. He turns back 
               just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled 
               into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. Sam seems 
               stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it.

               A wrinkled OLD MAN approaches Sam and joins him on the bench. 
               He begins talking.

                                     MAN
                         So, what happened to you?

               Sam is startled, amazed that the man can see him.

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     MAN
                         You're new, huh? I can tell.

                                     SAM
                         Are you talking to me?

                                     MAN
                         Relax. It ain't like before, you 
                         know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax.

                                     SAM
                         Who are you?

                                     MAN
                         I'm waiting for my wife. She's in 
                         4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it.

               The man sticks his head into the green sheet covering Sam's 
               body. His head disappears. Sam is terrified.

                                     MAN
                              (continuing)
                         Shot, huh? That'll do it every time. 
                         Poor bastard. Well, get used to it. 
                         You could be here a long time.
                              (leaning in close)
                         I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't 
                         as bad as you think. Zip zap. They 
                         ain't nothin' at all. You'll see. 
                         You'll catch on.

               Suddenly there is a loud COMMOTION and we see several 
               PHYSICIANS operating furiously on an Old Man lying on the 
               table beside them. It is a life threatening situation and 
               they seem to be failing.

                                     MAN
                              (continuing)
                         He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it 
                         a million times. He's a goner. See? 
                         Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could 
                         have been the other ones. You never 
                         know.

               ANGLE

               Before Sam can understand what is happening the entire room 
               fills with a strange preternatural light. Suddenly he looks 
               up and freezes.

               The amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating 
               down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the 
               operating table. They are emitting a powerful light.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Hurry, we're losing him.

                                     MAN
                         What'd I tell you? Bingo!

               The glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help 
               extract it from his body. His physical form changes instantly 
               from a solid object into an ethereal substance.

               Sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit 
               upward. They evaporate through the ceiling.

                                     DOCTOR
                         He's gone.

               ANGLE

               The light in the room grows dull instantly. Nurses cover the 
               dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. Sam 
               turns to the Old Man.

                                     SAM
                         Who are you? What's happening...?

               The Man isn't there. An Orderly approaches the gurney with 
               Sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator. Sam 
               jumps in front of him.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         No!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               as the stretcher begins to roll right through him. The 
               penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam. He 
               stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly 
               intersects with his. It is a stunning moment of extraordinary 
               strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the 
               Orderly's body passing through his. It is like a glimpse of 
               ultimate chaos, the universe within.

               Then, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is 
               still shaking. He stares up at the ceiling.

                                     SAM
                         Oh God, help me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur. 
               The hallway grows dark. It is as though Sam is blacking out.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes 
               a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral.

               The CAMERA TRACKS along rows of mourners as seen from SAM'S 
               P.O.V. He seems to be floating among them. We hear snippets 
               of conversations. It all seems strangely odd and disjointed. 
               Time seems unfixed, malleable.

               We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave.

                                     MINISTER
                         As we say farewell to our friend Sam 
                         Wheat, we are reminded of his 
                         kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy 
                         of spirit...

               The CAMERA KEEPS MOVING. Sam's associates from the bank are 
               among the mourners.

                                     MINISTER
                              (continuing)
                         All that we treasure, our friends, 
                         our loved ones, our body, our mind, 
                         are but on loan to us. We must 
                         surrender them all. We are all 
                         travelers on the same road which 
                         leads to the same end.

               Sam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting one of 
               the mourners. The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves. 
               Sam is surprised. He looks behind him, but no one is there.

               As he turns back, the woman is walking away. She appears 
               just like any normal person until she approaches a large 
               gravestone and passes right through it. Sam is shocked.

                                     MINISTER
                         As our loved one enters eternal life, 
                         let us remember that love, too, is 
                         eternal, that although we will miss 
                         him, our love will light the void 
                         and dispel the darkness.

               Suddenly, Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Sam spots her. The CAMERA 
               STOPS.

                                     SAM
                         Molly.

               She does not respond. RUTH, her sister, leans over to her. 
               Tears form in Molly's eyes. A hand reaches out to give her a 
               tissue. Molly looks up. It is Carl. She gives him her hand. 
               He squeezes it with affection.

                                     MINISTER
                         ...and into Your hands we commend 
                         his spirit. May he rest in peace. In 
                         the name of the Father, the Son, and 
                         the Holy Ghost. Amen.

               The casket is lowered into the ground. Molly approaches the 
               grave. She us a little unsteady. Carl takes her elbow. A 
               shovel is placed in her hands. With great emotional effort 
               she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket. 
               It lands with a REVERBERATING finality. Sam shudders.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               LONG SHOT - PEOPLE

               leaving the cemetery. We hear them talking.

                                     VOICES
                         What time you going back to work?... 
                         What's the buzz on Digital? It's 
                         sad. He was so young... How's your 
                         new Honda?... Going away this weekend?

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CLOSEUP - SAM

               desperately alone. Down the hill, people are getting back 
               into their cars. Sam can see Molly being let into a limousine. 
               He stands there staring at his own casket, grieving. Then, 
               after a moment, he turns away. Separating from his body, 
               from his own grave site, he runs after her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               Molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft 
               surrounded by FRIENDS and WELL WISHERS. A young GIRL, her 
               niece, cuddles in her lap. People are eating and milling 
               around. Slowly THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN. It ends on Sam, 
               standing alone in a corner. In the midst of all the activity 
               he is lost and alone.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               ANGLE

               Raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously. 
               Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. A bowl 
               begins to appear. The camera pulls back and reveals Sam. He 
               is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his 
               chest, rocking aimlessly.

               Molly looks away from the bowl she is forming. It distorts 
               and bends. Angry, she digs her finger into it. The bowl 
               disintegrates. Tears form in her eyes.

               Frank jumps up on the bench beside her. Molly stares sadly 
               around the room. Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to 
               the air.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh God, Sam...

               Sam looks up.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         I picked up your shirts this morning. 
                         I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said 
                         to tell you hello. I broke into tears. 
                         It's so hard...

               Sam walks over to Molly. Desperate for contact, he reaches 
               out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         I think about you every minute. It's 
                         like you're still here, like I can 
                         feel you, Sam.

               He stares at her, hoping, wondering.

                                     SAM
                         I am here, Moll. I am.

               ANGLE

               Suddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss. 
               Molly spins around. The cat scans the room. Unexpectedly, 
               Sam's and the cat's eyes meet... With a wild SCREECH, the 
               cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. Sam recoils. 
               Molly stands up.

                                     MOLLY
                         Frank, what's wrong? Frank?

               The cat is nowhere to be seen. All of a sudden, Molly freezes. 
               Sam is standing right beside her. It is almost as though she 
               senses his presence.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing; whispering)
                         Sam?

               She holds very still for a moment. Sam watches breathlessly, 
               loving her, wanting her. Then quietly, hopefully, he reaches 
               out. It is a useless gesture. In a moment of great poignancy, 
               Molly shakes her head and walks right through him. He remains 
               IN THE FRAME, alone.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Sam, stands in the corner of a large, walk-in closet, watching 
               as Molly goes through his effects. Boxes, scattered underfoot, 
               are filling up with his life's possessions. Molly reaches 
               for a shirt.

                                     SAM
                         Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my 
                         favorite...

               She tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater. It 
               is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big. Sam 
               recognizes it.

               Molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek. 
               After a moment she puts it back. Then, in a surprising 
               outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves. 
               Everything comes flying off. Sam reaches out to console her.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Molly, don't.

               Unexpectedly, Carl comes rushing into the room. He takes 
               hold of Molly and sits her on the bed.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Say something. Help her, Carl.

                                     CARL
                         It's hard. It's very hard.

                                     SAM
                              (sarcastic)
                         Oh good. That's really good.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Molly and Carl are standing over the kitchen table folding 
               piles of Sam's clothes and placing them into boxes. As Molly 
               lifts one of Sam's jackets, something falls from a side 
               pocket. It is his small black leather address book. Sam stares 
               at it with recognition. Carl sees the book fall and stoops 
               to pick it up but Molly gets it first.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam's address book.

               She skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes 
               are too powerful for her. She places it carefully into a box 
               labeled "Sam's Things -- Valuable" and continues packing. 
               She finds the old jar with the penny in it. It's marked "For 
               Luck". She holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it 
               on the nightstand beside the bed.

               Carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of Sam's 
               jackets. He examines them.

                                     CARL
                         Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I 
                         toss 'em?

                                     MOLLY
                         No!

                                     SAM
                         Molly, we hated that concert.

               She takes the stubs and lovingly puts them in the box. Sam 
               groans.

               Carl finds a half used package of Rolaids. Molly takes them 
               from his hand and puts them in the box, too.

                                     CARL
                         Oh, you want to save those?

                                     SAM
                         Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll?

               Molly just stares for a moment.

                                     MOLLY
                         I miss him, Carl.

               Carl comes over and takes her hand.

                                     CARL
                         We all do.

               Molly buries her head on his shoulder. Carl strokes her hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               Carl lifting a pile of boxes and carrying them to the door. 
               Suddenly Molly yells out.

                                     MOLLY
                         Wait. Wait. Not that one.

               She hurries over and pulls the "Valuable" box from the stack 
               in his arms. He looks at it with surprise.

                                     CARL
                         Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know 
                         how that got in there.

               He turns to the door and then back to Molly.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's 
                         like summer outside.

                                     MOLLY
                         No.

                                     CARL
                         Just for a stroll. It'd be good to 
                         get out.

               Molly shakes her head and turns away.

                                     MOLLY
                         I can't do it Carl.

               Carl, annoyed, walks over to her.

                                     CARL
                         Molly... you're not the one who died!

               Molly stops and looks at him. He has struck home. After a 
               moment she nods her head.

                                     MOLLY
                         Okay. Just a short walk.

               He gently squeezes her shoulders.

                                     CARL
                         Thata girl.

               Before Sam even understands what is happening, they are 
               exiting the loft. Sam jumps up and runs after them.

                                     SAM
                         Hey, Molly! Wait!

               ANGLE

               The door slams shut. Sam is locked inside. Frightened and 
               desperate, he rushes for the door knob. His hand sinks through 
               it. There is a strange sound, like ELECTRICAL STATIC, as it 
               penetrates the metal and wood. Frightened, he yanks it back.

               Sam circles the space several times and then returns to the 
               door. Clenching his teeth, he reaches out again. As his hand 
               pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle 
               resistance. The hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his 
               ghostly form presses into it. We sense Sam's fear as his 
               entire arm DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW. The grating ELECTRICAL SOUND 
               shudders up his spine.

               The sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but Sam does 
               not pull back. Slowly he edges in and presses his face into 
               the molecules of the wood.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               as atoms and electrons spin past him at frightening speed. 
               There is a sense of a universe in total chaos. Terrifying 
               SOUNDS charge through his body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM

               pulling back from the door. He is trembling.

               INT. LOFT - AN HOUR LATER

               THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY THROUGH THE LOFT AND GRADUALLY 
               DISCOVERS SAM. He is sitting in a corner singing quietly to 
               himself.

                                     SAM
                         "Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie. 
                         Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the 
                         levy was dry. Them good ol' boys 
                         were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and 
                         singing this'll be the day that I..."

               He stops, realizing the last word of the song. He sits 
               silently, staring at the wall.

               Suddenly, there is a SOUND at the door. Sam's eyes shoot up. 
               The door begins to open.

               Sam stands up. His face begins to tighten. We know instantly 
               that something is wrong. His eyes fill with a fury we have 
               not seen before.

               The Mugger, the man who killed Sam, is entering the loft. He 
               has a key in his hand and puts it in his pocket. Sam is 
               stunned. The Mugger locks the door.

               ANGLE

               Sam goes wild. He shoots at the man with all his might, 
               attacking him unceasingly, but with no effect. His hands and 
               feet pass right through him.

                                     SAM
                         You motherfucking bastard! What the 
                         hell are you doing here? What are 
                         you doing?

               The Mugger, unaware that anything is going on, glances around 
               nervously as he moves through the vast space.

               ANGLE

               Entering the bedroom, the Mugger goes to the dresser and 
               quickly examines the drawers. He is very neat, careful to 
               leave no sign that he was there. He seems to be looking for 
               something but cannot find it.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Suddenly we hear a KEY TURNING in the front door. The Mugger 
               seems startled. He dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly 
               behind one of the large sculptures. We hear the door OPEN. 
               Molly is standing there.

               Sam goes crazy.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, no! Get out!

               Molly closes the door and locks it shut. Sam freezes as she 
               heads for the bedroom. She walks right past the Mugger. To 
               Sam's horror she stops and turns to look around. There is a 
               curious expression on her face. Seeing nothing she continues 
               through the loft.

               The Mugger pulls out his gun. Sam looks on in absolute terror.

               Molly's purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove 
               her clothes. She turns on the radio.

               Sam doesn't know what to do. The Mugger seems excited by 
               Molly's semi-nudity. He begins skirting the edges of the 
               loft, moving toward the bedroom. Sam is crazed.

               Suddenly, out of nowhere, Frank appears at the Mugger's feet. 
               Sam's eyes light up. He drops to his knees, crawls over to 
               him, glares into his eyes, and screams.

               ANGLE - THE CAT

               SCREECHES and jumps straight up. His claws shoot out at the 
               mugger's face, ripping into the flesh near his eye.

               Blood appears. The mugger sees it dripping through his 
               fingers. The sight of it upsets him. He grabs the cat angrily 
               by the neck. It SQUEALS. Molly in her bra, peers from the 
               bedroom.

                                     MOLLY
                         Frank, what's wrong?

               The Mugger holds the cat's mouth shut. Seeing and hearing 
               nothing, Molly steps back into the bedroom.

               The Mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor. 
               Holding his eye, he gets up and rushes for the exit. Sam 
               runs after him, but the door closes before he can get through. 
               He is left inside.

               ANGLE - SAM

               stares at the closed door in a wild panic. He doesn't know 
               what to do. Then, summoning all of his courage, he takes a 
               blind, running slow motion leap and charges through it.

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               There is a brief sense of passing through a molecular force 
               field, a miniature universe inside the door.

               ANGLE - SAM

               as he emerges from the door and lands on the other side. He 
               seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with 
               himself.

               EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

               The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward 
               the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his 
               eye.

               Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of 
               people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is 
               frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at 
               him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their 
               arms cutting through his ghostly form.

               Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people 
               approach him from all angles.

               We hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly 
               falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let 
               go.

               A barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than 
               he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up. He stays close 
               to the Mugger.

               EXT. NEW YORK SUBWAY STATION - DAY

               The Mugger heads down a flight of steps into the IRT.

               INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

               The Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car. Sam stands near a 
               corner of the train watching him.

               Suddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening. One 
               of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward 
               him. As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes 
               right through him. It takes Sam a moment to realize what is 
               happening, but then it is too late.

               ANGLE - THE OTHER GHOST

               With unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam. The attack 
               is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how 
               to defend himself. With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs 
               hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head 
               plows right through it.

               ANGLE

               on Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel 
               rushes past him. There is a panicked look on his face. The 
               look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling 
               down on him.

               ANGLE

               on Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost 
               as the other train shoots by the window. With a huge gasp, 
               Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the 
               Ghost's hold. The Ghost flies after him, screeching.

               Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds 
               himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway 
               Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane 
               look.

                                     GHOST
                         Stay off! This is mine!

               ANGLE FAVORING WINDOW

               With shocking impact, the Ghost's fist goes flying into the 
               window. To Sam's terror and amazement, the window SHATTERS. 
               The Ghost smiles. Passengers scream and Sam dives for cover. 
               Sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion. 
               Suddenly, the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel 
               into broad daylight.

               EXT. ELEVATED SUBWAY STATION - DAY

               The train stops at an elevated subway platform in Brooklyn.

               OMITTED

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               Sam sees the Mugger exiting the train and frantically rushes 
               after him.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Sam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the 
               street.

               EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY

               The Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place. The streets are 
               lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded 
               up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of 
               heavy machinery onto the pavement.

               Sam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and 
               notices a sign, "SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, 
               ADVISOR." He looks up to a third story window and sees a 
               similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on 
               the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the 
               Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes 
               after him.

               EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY

               Sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321 
               Prospect Place.

               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

               Sam follows the Mugger into the building and watches as he 
               opens the mail box for APT. 4D. The name scribbled across it 
               is WILLIE LOPEZ. There's no mail.

               INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Sam enters Willie's apartment. It is a squalid affair. Peeled 
               paint chips litter the floor. The bed is unmade.

               Willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops 
               in the keys to Molly's loft. Sam sees his wallet. His driver's 
               license, bank ID, and a photo of Molly are there, too. 
               Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch, 
               knowing it will have no effect. He turns instead to a window 
               and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist. 
               Nothing happens.

                                     SAM
                         Damn!

               Willie dials the phone. Someone comes on the line.

                                     WILLIE
                         She came home. I couldn't get it. 
                         Give me a couple of days. I'll go 
                         back.

               He hangs up. Sam stares at him in wild confusion.

                                     SAM
                         Get what? Who the hell are you? What 
                         were you doing at Molly's? What the 
                         hell's going on?

               Willie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies 
               down. After a moment he reaches over and takes Molly's photo 
               from the drawer. He studies it slowly.

               Sam stands by the door in a state of motionless rage. There 
               is nothing he can do.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Stay away from her!

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Sam storms down the street. His movements seem undirected, 
               utterly aimless. He is seething inside.

               Suddenly Sam looks up. An old BAG LADY is walking down the 
               street talking loudly to a SHORT WOMAN tagging along beside 
               her. As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to 
               the side. The Short Woman, however, walks right through it. 
               Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself. Sam, 
               unsettled, rushes away.

               As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of MUSIC explodes out 
               of nowhere. Sam jumps into the street, gasping. A phonograph 
               needle SCRATCHES across a record and the MUSIC STOPS. A 
               woman's voice booms out:

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Sorry 'bout that.

               PANNING SHOT

               to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window. The MUSIC 
               blares out once more and SOUNDS of gospel fill the street.

               Sam looks up. He is back in front of the storefront church 
               with the sign for SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, 
               ADVISOR, hanging overhead. Below it is another sign. "Contact 
               the dearly departed. $20.00".

               Sam stares at the sign with curiosity. The MUSIC is 
               compelling. After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open 
               door.

               INT. STOREFRONT - DAY

               A record player is sitting near the storefront window, a 
               makeshift microphone placed in front of it.

               Several rows of folding chairs face a raised platform with 
               nothing on it. A number of people are sitting there, mostly 
               women. One gets the sense that this is a cross between a 
               waiting room and a meeting hall. A black WOMAN steps up on 
               the platform and calls out:

                                     WOMAN
                         Rosa Santiago.

               MRS. SANTIAGO tucks a Spanish paperback romance into her 
               purse and heads to a door at the rear of the hall. Sam follows 
               after her.

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - DAY

               Mrs. Santiago enters a dark room with a window and door 
               leading to a side street. A paisley bedspread is tacked over 
               the window.

               In the center of the room is a round seance table. Two 
               heavyset sisters, CLARA (39), and LOUISE (36), are standing 
               beside an open closet. It is empty.

                                     WOMAN
                         Please be seated.

               Mrs. Santiago sits at the table. She seems apprehensive. 
               Clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as 
               though demonstrating that they are solid.

                                     CLARA
                         My sister will be with us soon.

               She steps back out and closes the door. Louise inserts a 
               tape into a boom box and then steps forward.

                                     LOUISE
                         Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of 
                         your all-seeing presence. Appear for 
                         us now.

               ANGLE FAVORING CLOSET

               She turns back to the closet and opens the door. Like magic, 
               ODA MAE BROWN, 41, appears standing inside. She is a black 
               woman in a white tunic. The whiteness of her garment makes 
               it look as if she is glowing in the dark. Mrs. Santiago is 
               wide-eyed. Sam smiles as Oda Mae steps into the room.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Mrs. Santiago.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Buenos dias.

               She takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it 
               to Oda Mae. Clara graciously intercepts the money.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I understand you are hoping to contact 
                         your husband.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Si. Si.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Well, I believe he's gonna be with 
                         us today.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Oh, tsank you, tsank you.

               Tears well up in her eyes. She crosses herself several times.

                                     ODA MAE
                         But there's no telling about the 
                         other world. You gotta cast out all 
                         doubt. You gotta believe. Do you 
                         believe?

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                              (nodding her head 
                              vigorously)
                         Si. Si. I believe. I believe.

                                     ODA MAE
                         And remember, we don't make no 
                         promises. I can phone up there till 
                         I'm blue in the face,
                              (she points to the 
                              ceiling)
                         ...but it don't necessarily mean 
                         he's gonna be home. Them folks go 
                         shopping, they play bingo. It's just 
                         like here. You can't always get 'em.

               Mrs. Santiago, utterly fascinated, nods understandingly.

                                     SAM
                         Sure lady!

               Oda Mae's eyes glance up curiously for a second, as though 
               she heard something, and then she continues.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Okay, let's get ready then.

               Sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves 
               behind Oda Mae. The moment feels rehearsed, theatrical. Oda 
               Mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes. There 
               is a hush in the room. Her body begins to tremble. Mrs. 
               Santiago clutches her chair. Suddenly Oda Mae breaks out of 
               her trance.

                                     ODA MAE
                         We got a problem here. I don't think 
                         he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did 
                         he know someone who's passed over, 
                         someone named Anna... Mary... 
                         Consuela... Maria?

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Si, si! His mama. She's Maria.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Ah! I knew it. He's with his mama.

                                     SAM
                              (sarcastic)
                         Oh my God...

               Oda Mae's eyes dart uncomfortably around the room.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard. 
                         Now I got two souls I gotta contact. 
                         I don't know about that. It's 
                         difficult, you know. The pain. The 
                         effort.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         I pay more. How much? How much?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Twenty dollars.

                                     SAM
                         Way to go. Milk her for every penny.

               Oda Mae jumps up and stares at her sisters. They look back 
               at her curiously. They can't figure out what's wrong. Neither 
               can Oda Mae.

               Mrs. Santiago reaches into her purse. A twenty dollar bill 
               changes hands. Sam watches, amazed at it all. Oda Mae sits 
               down and goes back into her trance. Her eyeballs roll up 
               into their sockets.

                                     CLARA/LOUISE
                         Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

               Oda Mae is beginning to shake again. The two women grab her 
               shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair. Suddenly 
               her whole body stiffens.

                                     CLARA/LOUISE
                              (continuing)
                         Have mercy! Have mercy!

               Mrs. Santiago stares on in amazement. After a moment Oda 
               Mae's body collapses in a heap. Then, like a phoenix rising 
               from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes 
               a normal pose.

               After several seconds to get her bearings, Oda Mae begins to 
               speak. Only now she has an entirely new voice. It sounds 
               deep and hoarse, like an old man's. For all its put on 
               theatricality, it is strangely convincing.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are 
                         fortunate today. The channel is clear. 
                         Many spirits are gathering.

                                     SAM
                              (scanning the room)
                         Yeah? Where?

               Oda Mae jerks. Her eyes dart nervously around the room.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         My husband?

                                     ODA MAE
                              (a bit uneasy)
                         I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes, 
                         he is drawing toward us now. I can 
                         see him coming.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he 
                         look?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh, he is a very handsome man.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                              (surprised)
                         Handsome?

                                     ODA MAE
                         In our Father's Kingdom we are all 
                         handsome.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                              (understanding)
                         Julio!

               Sam looks on dismayed.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He is standing before me. He is 
                         wearing a black suit.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was 
                         buried in that.

               Mrs. Santiago begins to cry. Sam looks around the room with 
               growing disgust. Then he leans over to Oda Mae and yells 
               into her ear.

                                     SAM
                         What a crock of shit!

               Oda Mae nearly falls off her chair. She spins around.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Who's there?

               Sam is stunned. Clara and Louise look at one another in total 
               confusion. This is obviously not part of the act. Mrs. 
               Santiago seems frightened.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Where are you?

                                     SAM
                              (looking around)
                         Who?

               Oda Mae screams and jumps up thrashing at the air. Her knee 
               kicks the table and sends it toppling. Mrs. Santiago is 
               terrified.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Julio! Julio!

                                     SAM
                         What's going on?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Get out of here! Leave me alone!

               Mrs. Santiago doesn't know what to do. She begins to cry.

                                     SAM
                         Who are you talking to?

               Clara runs up to Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Keep him away!

               Louise looks at the empty room.

                                     SAM
                         Are you talking to me?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Do something. Help me.

               Clara just stares at her sister. Sam is excited and amazed.

                                     SAM
                         I don't believe this. Hey you. My 
                         name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me? 
                         Sam Wheat!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Stop it!

                                     SAM
                         Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it!

                                     CLARA
                         Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam Wheat!

               Sam nearly falls on his face. Clara's eyes widen. She is 
               more confused than ever.

                                     SAM
                         Jesus!

                                     CLARA
                         Samweet?

               Oda Mae runs into the closet.

               It has a false panel leading to a hidden chamber on the left 
               side and she barricades herself inside it. Clara and Louise 
               stand outside pulling on the handle. They seem frightened.

                                     CLARA/LOUISE
                         Oda Mae! Oda Mae!

               INT. CLOSET - DAY

               Oda Mae is rocking back and forth on the floor praying. Sam's 
               feet enter the frame beside her.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Lord, I swear, no more cheatin'. I 
                         promise, Lord. I don't want to go to 
                         hell. I'll do anything. Gimme a 
                         penance. Just make him go away.

                                     SAM
                         Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right 
                         here!

               Oda Mae screams, jumps back into the closet, and bolts up 
               against the door. It tears from its hinges and falls into 
               the seance room, nearly crushing Louise. Mrs. Santiago runs 
               out screaming. Oda Mae takes one look around and collapses 
               in a dead faint.

               OMITTED

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - DAY

               Beads of sweat collect on Oda Mae's brow and cheeks. She 
               seems feverish. Clara and Louise are sitting beside her with 
               damp towels nervously soaking up the perspiration. Oda Mae 
               appears to be talking to herself until we PULL BACK and reveal 
               Sam nearby.

                                     ODA MAE
                         My mama, her mama, may they rest in 
                         peace, they had de gift. Mama always 
                         said I had it, but I never did. She 
                         tol' me all about it, how it felt 
                         an' all. But now that it's happenin' 
                         I don't know what to do. You're 
                         scarin' me half to death. Please, 
                         you gotta go away, you gotta find 
                         someone else.

               Clara and Louise look at one another with growing concern.

                                     SAM
                         Someone else? Are you outta your 
                         mind?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm gettin' there fast.
                              (she pushes Louise's 
                              hand)
                         Leave me alone.

                                     SAM
                         Not till you help me.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Where are you?

                                     LOUISE
                         Where? I'm right here.

                                     SAM
                         I'm standing right beside you.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (mimicking his words)
                         "I'm standing right beside you."
                              (she pauses and looks 
                              up)
                         Are you white?

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh God, I knew it. He's white. Why 
                         me?

               Louise looks at her sister and shakes her head.

                                     SAM
                         Listen, damn it. You can help me. 
                         There's a woman, Molly Jensen. She's 
                         in terrible danger. The man who killed 
                         me broke into our apartment. He's 
                         going to go back. You've gotta warn 
                         her.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Why would she listen to me?

                                     SAM
                         She has to! This man's a killer! 
                         He's got a key.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Forget it, mister. I can't.

                                     SAM
                         It's just a phone call. You're all 
                         I've got. Lookit. I'm not leavin' 
                         till you help me. I don't sleep 
                         anymore, so I can sit here day and 
                         night. I don't care how long it takes. 
                         I can talk forever.

               Oda Mae gulps, a horrified expression on her face.

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               The telephone rings. Molly, preparing dinner, runs to answer 
               it.

                                     MOLLY
                         Hello.

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         Molly? Is this Molly speaking?

                                     MOLLY
                         Yes.

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         My name is Oda Mae. I'm a spiritual 
                         reader and adviser.
                              (she hesitates)
                         I'm calling for a friend of yours. 
                         He asked me to call. This is 
                         important. You gotta believe me. 
                         Don't be afraid.

                                     MOLLY
                         Who is this?

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         I got a message from Sam.

                                     MOLLY
                              (stunned)
                         What?

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.

               Molly slams down the receiver, panting. For several seconds 
               she doesn't move. Slowly, she walks to the couch and sits 
               down. She is trembling.

               INT. ODA MAE'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Oda Mae hangs up the phone.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What'd I tell you.

                                     SAM
                         You gotta go there.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Look, I don't care what you do to 
                         me, I'm not goin' nowhere.

               INT. ODA MAE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sam is sitting on the edge of Oda Mae's bed, singing. It 
               sounds like he's been singing for hours. He is very hoarse.

                                     SAM
                         "I'm Henery the Eighth I am / Henery 
                         the Eighth I am, I am / I'm gettin' 
                         married to the widow next door / 
                         She's been married seven times before 
                         / And every one was an Henery / 
                         Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam / 
                         I'm her eighth old man I'm Henery / 
                         Henery the Eighth I am, I am / Henery 
                         the Eighth I am / Second verse same 
                         as the first / I'm Henery the Eighth 
                         I am..."

               Oda Mae bolts upright in her bed, her hands over her ears.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Okay! Okay! I'll go. You just shut 
                         your mouth.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY BUS - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

               INT. BUS - DAY

               Sam and Oda Mae are sitting at the rear of a crowded bus. 
               She appears to be talking to herself.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I can't believe I'm doin' this. I 
                         gotta be a crazy lady goin' into the 
                         city with you. I never go there. 
                         What the hell you doin' in my life, 
                         huh? Why me?

               Several people move away.

               OMITTED

               EXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY

               Oda Mae approaches the loft building and buzzes Molly's 
               apartment. She waits a few moments.

                                     ODA MAE
                         There's nobody there.

                                     SAM
                         Just wait.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No, sir. I did what I promised. I 
                         said I'd come and I'm here. I didn't 
                         say anything 'bout waitin'.

                                     SAM
                         Just one more time. Please. It's a 
                         big place.

               Oda Mae turns to leave. Sam, desperate, starts to sing.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the 
                         wall, ninety nine bottles of beer,"

               Oda Mae stops. She turns back to the buzzer and rings once 
               more. Suddenly Molly answers.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         Hello, who's there?

                                     ODA MAE
                              (nervous)
                         Don't go away. It's Oda Mae Brown. I 
                         called you last night. Your friend 
                         Sam says you gotta talk to me.

               There is a CLICK as Molly hangs up.

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               Molly walks away from the intercom, shaken. Suddenly we hear 
               Oda Mae yelling up from the street.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                         Hey you, Molly! You gotta listen to 
                         me! this is for real. Sam is here. 
                         He needs to talk to you.

               Molly walks over to the window and looks down. Oda Mae is 
               standing in the street looking up. She is calling out at the 
               top of her lungs. Molly pulls back. She is afraid.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         He says remember the starfish at 
                         Montego Bay? Remember the picture he 
                         took a' you in Reno?
                              (pause)
                         Remember his green underwear, the 
                         pair you wrote your name on? She 
                         wrote her name on 'em?

               Molly tenses. There is a sign of recognition in her eyes.

               EXT. TRIBECA STREET - DAY

               Oda Mae is standing by the curb and shouting up to Molly's 
               fifth floor window. Several people stare at her curiously. 
               She turns to them.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Hey, do you mind? This here's a 
                         private conversation.

               The people turn away. She turns back to the window. Sam 
               prompts her.

                                     SAM
                         Ask her about the sweater in the 
                         closet, the one she knitted that's 
                         too big.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What about the sweater you knitted 
                         that was too big?

                                     SAM
                         Four sizes.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Four sizes.

                                     SAM
                         She couldn't throw it out. I saw. I 
                         was there.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You couldn't throw it out. He saw. 
                         He was there. This is for real. Hey 
                         do you hear me up there?

               A WORKMAN peers out of a second story window.

                                     WORKMAN
                         I hear you.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm not talkin' to you.

                                     WORKMAN
                         Haven't you ever heard of phones?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Kiss my behind!
                              (yelling again)
                         Listen, I'm not gonna stand here all 
                         day.

                                     WORKMAN
                         Thank God.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Forget it. I've had enough of this.

               Oda Mae is about to walk away when the entrance door opens. 
               Molly steps outside. Oda Mae sees her and stops.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Molly?
                              (Molly nods)
                         I'm Oda Mae Brown.
                              (walking over and 
                              shaking her hand)
                         You can call me Oda.

               INT. SOHO LUNCHEONETTE - DAY

               Molly and Oda Mae are sitting in a booth staring at one 
               another.

                                     MOLLY
                         Why should I believe you? Why should 
                         I believe any of this?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Girl, if you think I'd come down 
                         here for the fun of it, you got 
                         another think comin'. This Sam of 
                         yours... I don't know, lady. I mean, 
                         you ever hear a whole night of "Henry 
                         the Eighth I am?"

                                     MOLLY
                         He did that? That's how he got me to 
                         go out with him.

                                     ODA MAE
                         And he cain't carry a tune.

                                     MOLLY
                         I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy. 
                         I can't believe I'm talking to you 
                         like this. I don't believe in these 
                         things. I don't believe in life after 
                         death.

                                     SAM
                         Tell her she's wrong.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says you're wrong.

                                     MOLLY
                         You're talking to him right now?

                                     ODA MAE
                         What? You think I'm makin' it up?

                                     MOLLY
                         Where is he?

                                     ODA MAE
                         How should I know? It's not like I 
                         can see him. I just hear his voice.

                                     SAM
                         I'm holding her hand.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he's holding your hand.

                                     MOLLY
                         I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why 
                         are you doing this to me? I don't 
                         believe a word you're saying. Sam is 
                         dead. He's dead.

                                     SAM
                         I'm holding her hand.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he's holding your hand.

               Molly's hand jumps. Oda Mae looks at her. There is a long, 
               poignant moment. Sam chokes up.

                                     SAM
                         God, I love her. I love her so much.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he loves you... so much.

                                     MOLLY
                              (shaking her head)
                         No. He would never say that.

                                     SAM
                              (his eyes brightening)
                         Ditto. Tell her "ditto".

                                     ODA MAE
                         Ditto? What's that mean, ditto?

               Molly starts, an expression of true astonishment shining in 
               her eyes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam?

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               Molly is pressed up against the edge of the couch listening 
               nervously as Oda Mae speaks. Sam wanders around the room, 
               anxiously.

                                     ODA MAE
                         To tell the truth, I don't know how 
                         I'm doin' it. In fack, confidentially, 
                         nothin' like this never happened to 
                         me before. Now, all a sudden, I can't 
                         turn it off.
                              (she sees a photo of 
                              Sam)
                         Is this you? Is this him?

               They both say "yes" at the same time.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing; to Sam)
                         Hazel eyes, huh? You sound like they'd 
                         be blue.

                                     MOLLY
                         I don't understand. Why did he come 
                         back? Why is he still here?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Cause he's stuck, that's why. He's 
                         between worlds. It happens sometimes, 
                         when their spirits get out too quick. 
                         He thinks he still has stuff t'do 
                         down here.

                         Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude.

               Molly stares at Oda Mae.

                                     SAM
                         I do not have an attitude.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to Molly)
                         We're having a discussion.
                              (back to Sam)
                         Whataya mean, you're not angry? If 
                         you weren't angry you wouldn't be 
                         raisin' your voice like that.

                                     SAM
                         Goddamn it, Oda Mae!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don't 
                         talk to anybody who takes the Lord's 
                         name in vain.

               She stands up, as if to leave. Molly watches with growing 
               discomfort as Oda Mae seems to be talking to herself.

                                     SAM
                         Relax, Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You relax. You're the dead one. You 
                         want my help, then you apologize. 
                         Nobody talks to me like that, 
                         understand?

                                     SAM
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to Molly)
                         Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go.

               Oda Mae heads for the door. Molly is confused.

                                     MOLLY
                         I don't believe I'm watching this.

                                     SAM
                         Damn it. All right. I apologize.

               Oda Mae stops, pauses a moment, and walks back to the couch. 
               Sam, relieved, paces back and forth.

               Oda Mae's eyes follow his voice as Molly watches her 
               curiously.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell 
                         Molly what I'm saying. You gotta 
                         tell her word for word.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Monsieur has a message for you.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, you're in danger.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You can't tell her like that. And 
                         would you stop movin' all over the 
                         place? You're makin' me sick.

               Molly looks concerned. Sam leans into Oda Mae.

                                     SAM
                         Say it!

                                     ODA MAE
                         He's sayin' you're in danger.

                                     MOLLY
                         Danger?... What do you mean?

                                     SAM
                         I know the man who killed me. Willie 
                         Lopez. I know where he lives.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he knows the man who killed 
                         him, Willie Lopez. He's Puerto Rican.

               Molly grows pale as she listens. Her forehead tightens.

                                     SAM
                         Write it down.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Write it down.

                                     SAM
                         You do it!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Now I'm a secretary.

               Oda Mae takes a card from her purse and grabs a pencil.

                                     SAM
                         321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D.

                                     ODA MAE
                         321? Hey, that's my neighborhood.

               Oda Mae seems perplexed as she writes it down and gives it 
               to Molly.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, he's got my wallet and my 
                         key. He was in here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He's got his wallet and key. He was 
                         in here.

                                     MOLLY
                         In here?

                                     SAM
                              (directly to Molly)
                         You have to go to the police. The 
                         Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a 
                         setup, Moll. I was murdered.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he was set up, that he was 
                         murdered. He wants you to go to the 
                         police.

               Molly stands up, afraid. Oda Mae stands up, too.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         I'm sorry. I don't want nothin' to 
                         do with this.

               Oda Mae heads for the door as Molly watches in a daze.

                                     SAM
                         Where you going?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Don't follow me! I've done all I'm 
                         gonna do.
                              (opening the door)
                         I'm finished. And I ain't comin' 
                         back. So don't you come botherin' me 
                         again cause it's over. I mean it. 
                         This is it. Have a nice life. Have a 
                         nice death. I'm goin'.

               She lets herself out. Sam just stands there as the door slams 
               shut.

               OMITTED

               INT. KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

               Carl is pacing nervously. He seems very upset. After a moment 
               he approaches Molly. Sam is behind her.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, there's no one on earth who'd 
                         like it to be true more than me, but 
                         you've got to be rational about this. 
                         I understand your desire to hold on 
                         to him, but this... this is absurd.

                                     MOLLY
                         It was real, Carl. She was real.

                                     SAM
                         Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She 
                         needs some support here.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, you're a grown woman. How can 
                         you believe some fortune teller from 
                         Brooklyn...?

                                     MOLLY
                         She was in touch with him.

                                     CARL
                         I don't believe it, Molly. Not for a 
                         minute.

                                     SAM
                         Come on, Carl. Open your mind.

               Carl sits down beside her.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, she knew things.

                                     CARL
                         What kind of things?

                                     MOLLY
                         I told you, the picture in Reno, the 
                         starfish,... damn it, Carl.
                              (with great difficulty)
                         She said Sam knew who killed him. 
                         That he was set up... murdered.

                                     CARL
                         Oh boy. This is getting deranged. 
                         We're going off the deep end here.

                                     SAM
                         Give him the address, Moll.

                                     MOLLY
                         She had a name, an address -- Willie 
                         Lopez, 321 Prospect Place. She said 
                         he had Sam's wallet.

               Sam smiles. Carl stands up. His voice begins to rise.

                                     CARL
                         This is sick. This is really sick. 
                         How can you swallow this crap? Who 
                         knows if this guy exists? Maybe she's 
                         just setting someone up.

                                     MOLLY
                         That's what I have to find out.

                                     CARL
                         Find out? What are you talking about?

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam wants me to go to the police.

                                     CARL
                         Sam wants you to go to the police? 
                         Molly! Jesus! Are you outta your 
                         mind? What are you gonna tell 'em? 
                         Some storefront psychic's been getting 
                         messages from the dead? Do you know 
                         how that sounds? You're talkin' ghosts 
                         here, for God's sake.

               Molly looks suddenly vulnerable.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         I'm sorry. This stuff just really 
                         gets to me.

                                     MOLLY
                         You don't believe me. You don't 
                         believe any of this, do you?

                                     CARL
                              (half heartedly)
                         I'm trying to, but... Look, if it'll 
                         make you sleep any better, I'll check 
                         it out, okay? Now why don't you go 
                         to bed. Try and get some sleep.

               Molly looks at Carl, annoyed. She doesn't believe him for a 
               second.

               INT. CARL'S CAR - NIGHT

               Carl, in his red Ford Mustang, is speeding up town. Sam is 
               beside him in the front seat.

               INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING - NIGHT

               Carl steps into the lobby of Willie's building. Sam follows, 
               wide-eyed. He seems both intrigued and astounded by what 
               Carl is doing. When Carl stops to read the apartment number 
               on Willie's mail box, Sam is thrilled.

                                     SAM
                         Way to go, Carl!

               Carl climbs the stairs two at a time and approaches Willie's 
               door. He bangs on it, loudly.

               ANGLE - THE DOOR

               opens a crack as Willie peers out. Carl pushes it hard and 
               it opens the rest of the way. Willie steps back.

                                     WILLIE
                         Carl, what're you doin' here?

               Sam freezes as Willie addresses Carl by name. He can barely 
               move.

                                     CARL
                              (scared, in over his 
                              head)
                         Who've you been talking to?

                                     WILLIE
                         Talking to? What the hell do you 
                         mean? What's going on?

                                     CARL
                         Some woman knows all about you. The 
                         murder, everything. Where's she 
                         getting it from, huh?

                                     WILLIE
                         What the hell are you talking about? 
                         I haven't said a word.

               Sam is staggered. His body is shaking.

                                     CARL
                         She knows your name, goddamn it! She 
                         knows where you live!

                                     WILLIE
                         A lot of women know where I live.

               Carl is fuming.

                                     CARL
                         This isn't a joke, man. You find 
                         that bitch, whoever she is, and... 
                         get rid of her, you hear me? I've 
                         got four million dollars stuck in 
                         that fucking computer. If I don't 
                         get those codes, if that money's not 
                         transferred soon, I'm dead. If I 
                         lose Balistrari's money, we're both 
                         dead.

                                     WILLIE
                         Tell him you only wash dirty money 
                         on the first of the month.

                                     CARL
                         What is wrong with you? Is everything 
                         a joke? You were supposed to steal 
                         his wallet. You weren't supposed to 
                         kill him. Was that a joke?

                                     WILLIE
                              (casually)
                         I did you a favor. Freebee.

                                     CARL
                         Jesus!
                              (sickened)
                         These are drug dealers, man.
                              (pause)
                         Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've 
                         risked my job here. I could go to 
                         jail. A hundred thousand of that 
                         money goes to me. Now give me Sam's 
                         key. I'll get that address book 
                         myself.

               Willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out Sam's key. Sam, 
               unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage. Hauling 
               back, he slugs Carl with all his might. His fist has no 
               impact.

                                     SAM
                         You killed me, Carl. You had me 
                         killed. Look what you've done to me! 
                         Look what you've done!

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Carl is on the street heading back to his car. Sam is beside 
               him, yelling right into his face.

               He is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but Carl 
               doesn't hear him.

                                     SAM
                         You fucker! You mother fucker! I had 
                         a life, Goddamn you. I had a life!

               From the distance, we see Sam smashing into Carl. It is like 
               hitting the air. For all of his rage and bluster, there is 
               nothing he can do.

               EXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY

               Molly, neatly dressed, exits her building and hails a cab. 
               She hops inside. Seconds later she hops out again, yelling.

                                     MOLLY
                         You white fascist bigot. Who do you 
                         think you are? Bed Stuy's part of 
                         New York, you know. This is America.

               The driver speeds off. Molly gives him the finger.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - ELEVATED TRAIN - DAY

               Molly exits a subway station and walks toward 131st Street. 
               She is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as 
               she passes.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'?

               Molly pays no attention. Children run up to her, stare, and 
               run away.

               TRACKING SHOT

               When Molly turns down 131st Street, the crowds disperse and 
               she is all alone. There is a sense of menace in the air. A 
               group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks 
               by. One of them whistles. Molly keeps walking.

               EXT./INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING

               Molly sees Willie's building. She walks into the dank lobby. 
               It is dark and full of shadows. Leaning close, she examines 
               the mail boxes. Willie's name is there. She backs away, 
               afraid.

               INT. LIVINGROOM - DAY

               A dresser drawer opens and a box labeled "Sam's Things -- 
               Valuable" is slowly pulled out. A hand reaches inside it and 
               extracts Sam's address book. As THE CAMERA PULLS BACK, we 
               see that it is Carl standing in Molly and Sam's livingroom. 
               Carl opens the book and quickly jots down a series of code 
               numbers he finds in the back. His eyes sparkle with 
               excitement.

               INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Molly is sitting in a room opposite DETECTIVE SERGEANT THOMAS 
               BEIDERMAN, 48, and SERGEANT DOROTHY WALLACE, 29. Both officers 
               are staring at her as she speaks. She seems very 
               uncomfortable.

                                     MOLLY
                         Look, you've gotta believe me. I 
                         don't even believe this stuff, myself. 
                         But this is real. Do you think I'd 
                         come here if it wasn't real? You 
                         told me to come if I had any new 
                         information. Well, here I am.

               The officers don't respond.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Don't look at me like that. You guys 
                         use psychics all the time.

               There is dead silence.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Damn it. I know how this sounds. I 
                         hear myself saying it and I want to 
                         cringe. But this woman knew things 
                         she couldn't have known, intimate 
                         details.

                                     WALLACE
                         How intimate?

                                     MOLLY
                         Things Sam only said to me.

                                     WALLACE
                              (smirking)
                         Okay, let me get this straight. 
                         According to this psychic lady, there 
                         are ghosts and spirits all over the 
                         place, watching us all the time, 
                         huh?...
                              (she stands up)
                         I'm sorry. I've got important things 
                         to do.

               She leaves the room. Molly gives her a dirty look and turns 
               to Beiderman.

                                     MOLLY
                         I'm telling you. The killer's name 
                         is Willie Lopez. I've got his address. 
                         You've got to check it out.

               Sgt. Beiderman gets up and looks over to Molly.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         Okay. You just wait here. Let me see 
                         if this guy's got a record.

               He heads out of the room. Molly sits back with an air of 
               enormous relief and gratitude. Sergeant Wallace comes into 
               the room again and picks up a folder. Molly waits nervously. 
               After a moment Sergeant Beiderman returns with a police file 
               in his hands. Molly looks up at him, and then smiles at 
               Wallace as she sees it. She feels vindicated. He lays the 
               thick folder on the desk and opens it up. She hurries over 
               to him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MUG SHOTS OF ODA MAE

               and reams of police paperwork. WIDEN as Molly stares at it 
               all in sudden shock.

                                     MOLLY
                         What are you doing? Where's your 
                         file on Willie Lopez?

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         There's no file for a Willie Lopez. 
                         He was probably some old boyfriend 
                         she was trying to get even with. 
                         This psychic woman's record goes 
                         back a long way. Fraud, numbers 
                         rackets, you name it. She's a real 
                         pro.

               CUT BACK AND FORTH between the records and Molly's stunned 
               reaction. We see recent photos of Oda Mae and others going 
               back to her youth. They are fascinating and revealing. We 
               even see photos of her mother and grandmother. In addition, 
               there are pages of arrest records and prison files.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         1967. Shreveport, Louisiana. Forgery, 
                         selling false ID. Served one year. 
                         1971. Baton Rouge. Arrested for fraud, 
                         numbers racketeering. Served ten 
                         months. 1974. Hattiesburg, 
                         Mississippi. Fraud, seven months. 
                         1984. Albany, New York. Petty larceny. 
                         It goes on and on.

               Molly is overwhelmed by the evidence.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         This woman's a charlatan. You can't 
                         believe anything she said.

                                     MOLLY
                         This isn't possible. There were words, 
                         private things. How could she have 
                         known all that?

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         They have ways.

                                     MOLLY
                         Ways? What ways?

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         They've got a million cons. A lot of 
                         times they read the obits. All she 
                         had to do was see the word "banker". 
                         Hell, they even go through your 
                         garbage to find things they can use, 
                         letters, old papers. They don't need 
                         much.

               Molly turns away.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         I bet you threw stuff out, huh? It 
                         could have been anything. What about 
                         that underwear she knew all about?

               Molly's eyes widen.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         Green underwear. I'll bet she zeroed 
                         right in on that.

                                     MOLLY
                         No! She was real. She said things. 
                         She knew about a sweater I knitted, 
                         about songs we sang... She knew about 
                         this place we went, Montego Bay...

               Molly begins to cry.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         I'm sorry. I know this is hard. People 
                         want so much to believe. They're 
                         grieving, vulnerable. They'd give 
                         anything for one last moment... money, 
                         insurance policies. Believe me, these 
                         people know what they're doing. Look, 
                         I know how you must feel. You know, 
                         you can press charges.

               Molly shakes her head no. Sgt. Beiderman closes the file. 
               Molly sits for a long time. She is in terrible pain.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam.

               Sgt. Beiderman nods his head compassionately and then turns 
               away.

               INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (THE SAME DAY)

               Molly is sitting in her bedroom. The glow of the late 
               afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed. She 
               seems deeply depressed and alone. Gradually her gaze falls 
               on a jar sitting on the nightstand. In it is the penny Sam 
               found when they were first working on the loft. A label on 
               the jar says, "For Luck!" In a moment of sudden rage, she 
               picks it up and throws it against the wall. It SHATTERS on 
               the floor.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The code from Sam's address book, jotted on a piece of paper, 
               is sitting beside Carl.

                                     CARL
                              (excitedly)
                         God, let this be it!

               Anxiously, Carl punches the code into a computer and, 
               suddenly, Sam's old accounts appear on the screen. A look of 
               relief wafts across Carl's face.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Oh God, yes!

               Carl is staring at the same accounts Sam was examining the 
               afternoon before he was killed, the accounts with too much 
               money in them.

               Carl picks up the phone and punches a number. Someone answers.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set. 
                         We're fine. Everything's fine. Just 
                         tell me what you want me to do.

               A VOICE on the other end begins to speak.

                                     VOICE
                         We want you to transfer the money 
                         from the 12 separate accounts into a 
                         single account under the name "Rita 
                         Miller". Tomorrow, at five minutes 
                         before closing, 3:55 p. m., transfer 
                         the full account to First Island 
                         Bank of Nassau, registry number 486-
                         9580.

               Carl writes it all down.

                                     VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         Call us when it's done.

                                     CARL
                         Tell Mr. Balistrari there won't be 
                         any problems.

                                     VOICE
                         I'll do that.

               Carl hangs up. He seems deeply relieved.

               REVEAL SAM

               He is standing in front of Carl, watching. Quickly, Carl 
               begins punching commands into the computer. He is setting up 
               the dummy account. Rita Miller, #926-31043.

               INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT

               Molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. A 
               magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the 
               loft. She seems lost in the vast space. Sam is pacing back 
               and forth. There is a melancholy look in his eyes.

                                     SAM
                         Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need 
                         you.

               Suddenly the BELL rings. Molly jumps.

               Molly's finger is on the intercom. She seems unsettled.

                                     MOLLY
                         Who's there?

                                     CARL
                         Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up?

               Sam freezes. Molly is surprised. She hesitates a moment and 
               then pushes the buzzer to let him in. We hear Carl bounding 
               up the stairs.

                                     SAM
                         Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll!

               There is a KNOCK. Molly opens the door. Carl seems buoyant, 
               almost celebratory. He has a bag of fruit in his hand. He is 
               still in a suit and tie.

                                     CARL
                         Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm 
                         sorry to disturb you. I felt bad 
                         about last night. This supernatural 
                         stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. 
                         I don't even read horoscopes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Don't worry. It's okay.

                                     CARL
                         No it's not. You needed me to hear 
                         you and I didn't and that was wrong. 
                         I want you to know that I'm your 
                         friend, Moll.

                                     SAM
                         You were never our friend.

                                     CARL
                              (holding out a paper 
                              bag)
                         Hey, I brought you some Japanese 
                         apple pears. I know you like them.

                                     MOLLY
                              (taking the bag)
                         Oh, that's so sweet.

                                     CARL
                         Listen, can I come in for a minute? 
                         I won't stay long. I've had one of 
                         those days. Maybe a cup of coffee?

                                     SAM
                         No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him 
                         in!

                                     MOLLY
                              (hesitating)
                         Sure.

               OMITTED

               INT. LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Carl, in shirt sleeves and Molly in her robe, are sitting on 
               the couch drinking coffee. We notice that Carl is wearing 
               yellow suspenders. Sam is beside himself, watching them.

                                     MOLLY
                         Are you alright? You look nervous, 
                         upset.

                                     CARL
                              (glancing at her thighs)
                         What can I tell you. It's been tough. 
                         Hell, you know. It still hurts so 
                         much.
                              (he poses sadly)
                         Then on top of it all... it's the 
                         responsibilities. They've given me 
                         my own accounts, but I've had no 
                         time to adjust. My mind has been 
                         reeling.

               Molly reaches out and pats his arm. There is an awkward pause.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Where were you this morning? I thought 
                         you were coming to the bank to sign 
                         those papers.

                                     MOLLY
                         I didn't have time.
                              (beat)
                         I went to the police, Carl.

               Sam looks at her, amazed. Carl, on the other hand, stiffens. 
               He laughs nervously.

                                     CARL
                         You're kidding. You really did it? I 
                         don't believe... What did you tell 
                         them? What did they say?

                                     MOLLY
                         You were right, you know. I felt 
                         like such a fool. They brought out a 
                         file on this psychic woman ten inches 
                         thick. It was awful.

                                     CARL
                              (relieved)
                         A ripoff artist, huh?

                                     SAM
                              (shocked)
                         Molly, no.

                                     MOLLY
                         The sad part is that I believed her. 
                         I believed her, Carl.
                              (pause)
                         It was all a sham.

                                     CARL
                              (relaxing)
                         Sometimes we need to believe.

                                     MOLLY
                         Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe 
                         anything anymore. Why would people 
                         do such things?

               Sam is devastated.

                                     CARL
                              (milking it)
                         It's hard to face reality, Moll, the 
                         hard cold facts of it. What you have 
                         to remember is the love you felt. 
                         That's what's real. You have to 
                         remember how good Sam was. How much 
                         he loved you.

               Molly holds back tears. Carl reaches out tenderly and strokes 
               her hair.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         You were everything to him, Molly. 
                         You were his life.

                                     MOLLY
                              (finally crying)
                         I feel so alone.

                                     CARL
                         You're not alone. You're young. You've 
                         got so much talent. You're 
                         fantastically gorgeous.

                                     MOLLY
                              (appreciating his 
                              words)
                         Oh God, I don't know what's real 
                         anymore. I don't know what to think.

                                     CARL
                         Just think about Sam. Think about 
                         what he meant to you, the years you 
                         had together, how wonderful they 
                         were.

               Carl glides his hand slowly, lovingly across her cheek.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Let your feelings out.

               Almost imperceptibly, his hand moves down to the nape of her 
               neck. As she moves, her robe opens slightly. Carl notices, 
               glimpsing her nakedness beneath it. Sam notices, too. He 
               freezes.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Life turns on a dime, Moll. People 
                         think they have forever, that they'll 
                         always have tomorrow. But it's not 
                         true. Sam taught us that. We have to 
                         live for now, for today.

               Molly can barely contain her tears. Carl moves toward her 
               moist cheeks and kisses them gently. Slowly, he guides his 
               lips to her neck and kisses it, too. It is all hateful and 
               sensual at the same time. Sam turns away.

               Molly feels Carl's tenderness, needs it. She does not notice 
               his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling 
               it toward him. With a little tug the cord unravels and the 
               robe falls open. Molly is confused, aroused, not sure what 
               to do. She starts to pull it closed. He holds her hand. For 
               a moment they do nothing. Then his fingers reach for her 
               thigh. Her body quivers. Carl feels her openness and pulls 
               closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body.

               Molly's eyes close. She says nothing.

                                     SAM
                         No!!!

               OMITTED

               ANGLE

               Sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing 
               uncontrollably at the two of them. Unexpectedly his foot 
               kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and Molly that's 
               sitting on an end table. The picture CRASHES to the floor, 
               the glass SHATTERING.

               Molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken. She sees the photo 
               and recoils. Carl reaches for her. She backs away.

               Sam is stunned by what has happened. He jumps up and tries 
               kicking over another picture but nothing moves. His foot 
               goes right through it.

               Molly looks at Carl, drying her tears.

                                     MOLLY
                         I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's 
                         too soon... You've been great Carl, 
                         but... I need you to leave. Please. 
                         I need you to.

                                     CARL
                         Sure. It's okay. I understand. I 
                         really do.

               She reaches out and takes his hand.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow 
                         night? Just talk. Can I interest you 
                         in that?

                                     SAM
                         NO!!!

               Molly hesitates a moment and then nods her head "yes". Carl 
               smiles.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

               Sam rushes madly down a flight of stairs into a subway 
               station. A train is just leaving. He jumps on board.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

               Sam begins quickly casing the aisles, looking for something. 
               It is not there. Another train can be seen speeding past the 
               window. Sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it, passing 
               through the walls.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               ANGLE - SAM

               disappointed. Suddenly, an express train passes alongside 
               his local. Sam sticks his face inside it. Suddenly, he smiles 
               and rushes onto it.

               ANGLE

               Sam does not have to stand there long. Within seconds, the 
               terrifying Ghost he had seen before comes charging at him. 
               We notice him more clearly now. He is wearing a dark blue 
               pea coat. There is a grizzled look about him. He has stained 
               teeth and seems perpetually unshaven.

                                     GHOST
                         Get off my train!

               This time Sam does not back away. He holds his ground. The 
               Ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal. Posters come 
               flying off the walls. A bag of groceries topples from a 
               woman's arms, an old man's cane flies across the aisle, a 
               boy's Mets cap flips off his head. People on the train move 
               quickly to other cars.

               Unable to frighten him, the Ghost kicks Sam in the stomach. 
               Sam recoils, feeling it, but gets back up again. He is angry 
               now. He begins raging at the other Ghost. The Ghost is 
               shocked.

                                     SAM
                         Teach me how you do that! I want to 
                         learn! I'm not leaving til you teach 
                         me!

               The Ghost, exhausted, looks up at him and smiles with 
               appreciation.

                                     GHOST
                         You stubborn asshole.

               Sam nods in agreement.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM AND THE GHOST

               sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station. Sam is 
               trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         What are you doing? What are you 
                         doing? You can't push it with your 
                         finger. You're dead.

               The Ghost demonstrates, kicking a garbage pail onto its side. 
               Sam can't quite tell how he did it.

                                     SAM
                         I don't get it.

                                     GHOST
                         It's your mind, you idiot. It's all 
                         in the mind. The problem is you think 
                         you're still real, that you're 
                         standin' on the floor, that you're 
                         wearin' those clothes. Bullshit! You 
                         don't even have a body anymore. It's 
                         all up here. You wanna move things, 
                         you gotta use your mind. You gotta 
                         focus! You hear what I'm saying?

                                     SAM
                         How do you focus?

                                     GHOST
                         I don't know how you focus! You just 
                         focus!

               With surprising energy, the Ghost flicks a bottle cap and 
               sends it shooting across the subway platform.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         It's all in the anger. You gotta 
                         direct it. You gotta channel it.

                                     SAM
                         I'm angry all the time. It doesn't 
                         do a thing.

                                     GHOST
                         Cause you're angry all over. You 
                         gotta be angry here, in the pit of 
                         your stomach. Bring it down here. 
                         Let it explode.
                              (he makes an explosive 
                              gesture)
                         It's like a reactor, you know. Pow!

               He kicks a Coke can toward Sam. Sam tries to kick it back 
               and misses. The Ghost laughs. Sam gets angry. He tries again 
               and falls on his head. The Ghost laughs louder. Now Sam is 
               really angry. We see him forcing the anger down into his 
               stomach. He holds still for a moment and then kicks at the 
               can with all his might. To his shock and amazement, it sails 
               right through the Ghost's head. The Ghost smiles.

                                     SAM
                         I did it!

                                     GHOST
                         Way to go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM

               practicing. He smashes at an abandoned tennis shoe with his 
               fist. Nothing happens.

                                     GHOST
                         From your gut. What do I keep tellin' 
                         you?

               Sam's stomach bulges. He tries again. Nothing.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         Give it time! What else have you 
                         got?

               Undaunted, Sam tries once more. This time the tennis shoe 
               moves. The Ghost nods his head approvingly. Sam is thrilled.

                                     SAM
                         How long have you been here?

                                     GHOST
                         Since they pushed me.

                                     SAM
                         Someone pushed you?

                                     GHOST
                         Yeah, someone pushed me!

                                     SAM
                         Who?

                                     GHOST
                         What? You don't believe me? You think 
                         I fell? You think I jumped? Well, 
                         fuck you!
                              (an unexpected rage 
                              starts to build)
                         It wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed 
                         to go! I'm not supposed to be here!

               Venom spews from the Ghost's mouth. Suddenly he rams a 
               cigarette machine full force with his head. The glass SHATTERS 
               and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere. He throws himself 
               on top of them with terrible longing.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         I'd give everything for a drag. Just 
                         one drag.

               He rolls and wallows in terrible frustration, tossing the 
               cigarettes in all directions. Suddenly he looks up and sees 
               Sam. He is unable to control his fury.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         Who the hell are you? Why are you 
                         hounding me like this? Leave me alone.

               AN EXPRESS TRAIN

               is shooting through the station. The Ghost throws himself 
               into it and in an instant he is gone.

               OMITTED

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

               Sam, all alone, walks through the station. Suddenly, he 
               reaches out and pushes a garbage can lid. It swings back and 
               forth. He is delighted. A beer can is sitting on a bench. He 
               pushes it off, watching it roll across the platform with 
               childlike glee.

               Looking up, Sam sees an advertisement for Market Security 
               Bank and Trust. He stares at it with great interest. "Special 
               Banking for Special People. We make it easy for you." 
               Something registers in Sam's eyes. He yells and jumps straight 
               up, hitting a subway sign with his finger. With great 
               excitement, he runs for the stairs and rushes from the 
               station.

               OMITTED

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT

               ORTISHA JONES, a black woman with brassy red hair, is sitting 
               at Oda Mae's seance table surrounded by several of her 
               relatives. Clara and Louise stand behind Oda Mae helping 
               with the ritual. Oda Mae goes into her trance.

               ANGLE

               A GROUP OF GHOSTS is milling behind Oda Mae. Sam comes barging 
               into the room and looks at them in amazement.

                                     SAM
                         What the hell?

               Oda Mae, startled, jumps up in her chair. Everyone else jumps, 
               too. Clara and Louise look worried.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam?

                                     SAM
                         What is all this? What's goin' on?

                                     ODA MAE
                         What'd you do, tell every spook in 
                         town about me? I got spooks from out 
                         of town here. There's stuff goin' on 
                         you wouldn't believe. I can't hardly 
                         believe it myself.

               Ortisha and her relatives look up, confused.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae. You're doing it. This is 
                         for real. How do you like that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I don't.

                                     SAM
                         Come on. Look at this. You're doing 
                         great.

               One of the GHOSTS standing in the background butts in.

                                     GHOST
                         Can you hurry this up? My husband's 
                         in the waiting room.

                                     SAM
                         I need your help, Oda Mae. There's 
                         something we need to do.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Forget it. I'm not doin' anything. 
                         You're holdin' on to a life that 
                         don't want you no more. Give it up.

                                     SAM
                         Give it up? I'm already dead.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished 
                         dyin'. Give up the ghost.

                                     SAM
                         And how am I supposed to do that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         You're asking me?

               Ortisha looks at Oda Mae. She has no idea what's going on.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Are you speaking to me?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Does it look like I'm speakin' to 
                         you?
                              (continuing; to Sam)
                         So, are you gonna leave or not? I've 
                         got work to do.

               Ortisha is totally confused. Oda Mae turns back to her.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         What's a matter? You're supposed to 
                         be concentrating. How do you expect 
                         me to do this if you're not 
                         concentrating? Okay then. You ready? 
                         Let's do it.

               ANGLE

               Oda Mae and everyone in the room gets very quiet. One of the 
               ghosts draws close. Oda Mae's eyes roll up into her head. 
               Then, suddenly, an extraordinary thing occurs. We see the 
               spirit pull back and dive right into Oda Mae. Oda Mae gulps. 
               Her nostrils flare. Her eyes bulge.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh, Lord! Stop! Whatcha doin' to me?

               Oda Mae's body goes into bizarre convulsions as the Ghost 
               tries to move inside her. She looks strangely stuffed and 
               enormously uncomfortable.

               Sam and the others watch in astonishment as she tries to 
               speak, but nothing comes out.

               Then suddenly the GHOST speaks through Oda Mae.

                                     ORLANDO
                              (screaming)
                         Ortisha?!

               Ortisha and her relatives jump up in amazement.

                                     ORTISHA
                              (excitedly)
                         Orlando! Is that you?

                                     ORLANDO
                              (disoriented)
                         Ortisha, where are you? I can't see 
                         too good.

                                     RELATIVES
                         Here! She's here!

                                     ORTISHA
                         In front of you! I'm right here!

               Orlando suddenly zeros in on Ortisha. His eyes widen.

                                     ORLANDO
                         Mother of God, what've you done to 
                         your hair!?

               Ortisha smiles excitedly.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Orlando, do you like it? It's Autumn 
                         Sunrise.

               Suddenly Oda Mae's body begins to shake wildly and her voice 
               booms out, screaming with all her might.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Get out of here, you little shit!

               With frightening speed, she sends the spirit catapulting out 
               of her body. Clara and Louise jump up. Oda Mae is shaking.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Lord oh Lord, don't you ever do that 
                         to me!

                                     ORTISHA
                              (confused)
                         Orlando!?

               ANGLE ORLANDO

               He is lying on the floor, exhausted.

                                     ORLANDO
                         What happened to me? I can barely 
                         move.

                                     GHOST
                         You should know better than to try 
                         that. It's not worth it. It'll wipe 
                         you out for days.

                                     SAM
                         That was incredible, Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Never again. Never.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Where's Orlando?

                                     SAM
                         He spoke through you. It was amazing.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No more, uh uh, no more.

                                     ORTISHA
                         What happened to Orlando? Where'd he 
                         leave the insurance policy?

                                     SAM
                         You're great, Oda Mae! You're a real 
                         medium. It's what you were born for.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I want everybody out.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Orlando?

               Ortisha looks around the room, befuddled. Clara and Louise 
               aren't sure what to do.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Now!

               Ortisha and her relatives scurry out fast. The ghosts, too, 
               begin passing through the wall. Oda Mae lays her head on the 
               table. Suddenly her whole body begins heaving. She is starting 
               to cry. Sam is surprised.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae, what's wrong?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Out! I said out! That means you, 
                         too!

               Sam hesitates a moment and then respectfully follows the 
               others through the wall.

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Clara knocks on the seance room door and peeks in.

                                     CLARA
                         Oda Mae, there's a man here who says 
                         he has to see you right away.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I ain't seein' nobody.

               Willie pushes his way into the room. Clara isn't sure what 
               to do. Oda Mae looks up. She does not know him.

                                     WILLIE
                         Are you the one that can talk to the 
                         dead?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I beg your pardon! I'm not seeing 
                         customers right now.

                                     WILLIE
                         I said I need to know if you're the 
                         one.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm the one. But not now.

                                     WILLIE
                         This is important. I have a friend. 
                         He died recently. Some say he was 
                         mugged. I think he was murdered.

               Oda Mae stares at him curiously.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         I'm told you can contact people like 
                         that. Is that true?

                                     ODA MAE
                         It's been known to happen. But it's 
                         not gonna happen now, so come back 
                         later.

                                     WILLIE
                         I can't wait til later.

               He sits down across from Oda Mae and shows no signs of 
               leaving. Oda Mae observes him quietly for a moment.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What's your friend's name?

                                     WILLIE
                         Good question. Why don't you tell 
                         me?

               Oda Mae glares at him.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         You're the psychic, right?

                                     ODA MAE
                         This ain't no guessin' game.

                                     WILLIE
                         Then what is it, lady?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Lookit, I don't know what your trouble 
                         is...
                              (getting nervous)
                         Who are you?

                                     WILLIE
                         You're the mindreader. I hear you've 
                         been tellin' people about me for 
                         days. What's my name?

               ANGLE - ODA MAE

               confused and uncomfortable. Sam comes wandering back into 
               the room. His eyes bulge.

                                     SAM
                         Willie!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Willie!?

               Willie sits straight up in his chair, amazed.

                                     WILLIE
                         How'd you know that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Because I'm psychic.

               With a sudden thrust, Oda Mae sends her foot shooting into 
               Willie's balls. As he recoils she knocks the table into his 
               lap and rushes for the closet. We see her barricade herself 
               in the hidden chamber.

               Willie, shaking, scrambles to his feet and, before Sam can 
               stop him, BLASTS his gun at the closet door. It is riddled 
               with bullets. Sam screams out. Willie runs to the side door 
               and escapes to the street. Clara and Louise come rushing in.

               Sam charges into the closet and sees that Oda Mae is safe 
               behind the false door. Then he hurries to the street.

               OMITTED

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Sam rushes to the sidewalk and looks in all directions. Willie 
               is nowhere to be seen. He hurries back to Oda Mae.

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT

               The room is a disaster area, full of hysterical women. Oda 
               Mae is being dragged from the closet, unhurt but in a state 
               of shock.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He tried to kill me! Why? Why?

               No one answers.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Talk to me!

               Her sisters start talking but she shoos them away.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae, we're in trouble...

                                     ODA MAE
                         We're in trouble? Who's we? You're 
                         already dead.

                                     SAM
                         I can stop them. But I can't do it 
                         alone. You've gotta help me.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Help you? It's me they're tryin' to 
                         kill.

                                     SAM
                         You're right. And they'll be back. 
                         I'm your only chance.

                         and rattle some chains.

                         I need you Oda Mae. I need you to 
                         get some fake ID's.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Fake ID's? What for?

                         Help me now, they'll never bother 
                         you again. I promise.

                              (stopping, thinking)
                         Help you? Whataya talking about 
                         exactly? What else do I have to do?

               EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

               Oda Mae, dressed to the hilt, is walking with Sam toward the 
               main branch of Market Security Bank & Trust. She seems nervous 
               and upset.

                                     ODA MAE
                         This is crazy. This ain't gonna work. 
                         I don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'.

                                     SAM
                         I'll teach you. You'll learn fast.

               As they reach the entrance of the bank, they pass a pair of 
               NUNS collecting money to build a shelter for the homeless. 
               One of them holds out a collection box. Oda Mae passes her 
               by, carefully avoiding eye contact.

               INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Oda Mae enters Sam's bank. She seems completely out of place. 
               Sam, walking beside her, directs her every move.

                                     SAM
                         See where it says "New Accounts"? 
                         That's where you're going.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (paranoid)
                         I'm not givin' 'em any money.

                                     SAM
                         Just do what I say.

               Oda Mae approaches the New Accounts desk. She seems very 
               uptight. A woman OFFICER behind the desk looks up at her.

                                     OFFICER
                         Can I help you?

                                     SAM
                         Tell her you're here to fill out a 
                         signature card for a new account.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm here to fill out a signature 
                         card for a new account.

                                     OFFICER
                         And do you know your account number?

                                     SAM
                         Yes. 926-31043.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Yes. 926-31043.

                                     SAM
                         Rita Miller.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Who?

                                     OFFICER
                         What?

                                     SAM
                         Tell her Rita Miller.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Rita Miller.

                                     OFFICER
                              (eyeing her oddly)
                         Didn't they have you sign a card 
                         when you opened the account?

                                     SAM
                         Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for 
                         you by phone and asked you to come 
                         in today.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Carl Bruner opened it for me. He 
                         asked me to come in today.

                                     OFFICER
                         Ah.

               The Officer checks out the name and account number on her 
               computer screen. It all seems to jive. She pulls out a card 
               from her desk and hands it to Oda Mae. Oda Mae stares at it.

                                     SAM
                         Just sign you name at the bottom on 
                         the first blank line.

               Oda Mae nods and starts to sign "Oda Mae". Sam stops her.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         No, no, no. Rita Miller.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to the officer)
                         Can I have another one please? I 
                         signed the wrong name.

               Sam hits his forehead with his hand. The Officer gives her 
               another card. Oda Mae signs it.

                                     SAM
                         Tell her to see that it goes right 
                         up to the third floor file since you 
                         have a transaction to make.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I need you to put that in the third 
                         floor file cause I got a transfusion 
                         to make.

                                     OFFICER
                         A what?

                                     ODA MAE
                         You know what I mean.
                              (innocently)
                         Umm, can I keep the pen?

                                     OFFICER
                              (surprised, not sure 
                              what to say)
                         ...uh, sure.

               Oda Mae, delighted, walks away smiling and gives the officer 
               a wave. She is loving this.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Thanks.

               The clock on Carl's wall says 3:40. He seems anxious. The 
               phone RINGS. Carl jumps. He pushes down the speaker button.

                                     CARL
                         Hello. Carl Bruner speaking.

                         Carl?

                         Mr. Balsitrari

                                     VOICE
                         Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John. 
                         I've got the info on the Bradley 
                         portfolio.

                                     CARL
                         Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll 
                         pick it up later.

               He hangs up. His hand is shaking.

               INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Sam and Oda Mae approach a fancy part of the bank housing 
               administrative personnel. They approach a GUARD who is 
               standing there.

                                     SAM
                         Tell the guard you're here to see 
                         Lyle Furgeson.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Lyle Furgeson, please.

                                     GUARD
                         Do you have an appointment?

                                     ODA MAE
                         No. I'm here for the fun of it.

                                     SAM
                         Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's 
                         here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Tell him Rita Miller's here.

                                     GUARD
                         Just one moment, please.

                                     SAM
                         Don't embellish.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Yes, Sir.

                                     GUARD
                              (turning around)
                         Excuse me?

               She waves him on.

                                     SAM
                              (whispering)
                         Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a 
                         real jerk.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Why are you whispering?

                                     SAM
                              (he doesn't know)
                         Just be quiet and listen. I've known 
                         him five years and he still thinks 
                         my name's Paul.

               We see the Guard leaning over Mr. Furgeson's desk. FURGESON 
               looks up and sees Oda Mae. He shrugs his shoulders.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         He's a social moron. You don't have 
                         to worry about anything. Tell the 
                         guard Furgeson knows you. You spent 
                         time with him and his wife Shirley 
                         at the Brewster's Christmas party 
                         last year.

               The Guard comes back.

                                     GUARD
                         What is this regarding?

                                     ODA MAE
                         What? He doesn't remember me? We 
                         were together at the Brewster's 
                         Christmas party. With his wife 
                         Shirley. They had that lovely tree... 
                         all those presents. Why, I'll never 
                         forget all those beautiful...

               Sam pokes her. She yelps, surprised, and glances around. The 
               Guard gives her an odd look.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Oops. Gas.

               She forces a smile. He smiles back and then goes over to Mr. 
               Furgeson.

                                     SAM
                         This'll be easy. Furgeson was so 
                         drunk at that party, he could have 
                         had a conversation with Tina Turner 
                         and he wouldn't remember.

               The Guard whispers in Furgeson's ear. Furgeson appears totally 
               flummoxed. He looks up at Oda Mae, embarrassed, and waves. 
               The Guard motions her to come back. She walks proudly over 
               to his desk. He sticks out his hand.

                                     FURGESON
                         Hello, hello. Of course, of course. 
                         It's been so long.

                                     ODA MAE
                         A long time.

                                     SAM
                         Ask how Bobby and Snooky are.

                                     ODA MAE
                         How are Bobby and Snooky doin'?

                                     FURGESON
                              (perplexed)
                         Why, they're just fine, thank you. 
                         Nice of you to ask. And how is your... 
                         family?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Couldn't be better.

                                     FURGESON
                         Well, isn't that wonderful.

                                     SAM
                         Tell him you've been wondering how 
                         they did on the Gibraltar securities.

                                     ODA MAE
                         So tell me, Fergie, how did you do 
                         on the Gibraltar securities?

                                     FURGESON
                              (surprised)
                         The Gibraltar securities! Well, it 
                         looks like we topped out, huh?

                                     SAM
                         "We sure did!"

                                     ODA MAE
                         We sure did.

                                     FURGESON
                              (impressed)
                         That was a wonderful tip.

                                     SAM
                         "Good old Randy".

                                     ODA MAE
                         Good old Randy. Got a real head on 
                         his shoulders.

                                     SAM
                         "Her" shoulders.

                                     ODA MAE
                         "Her" shoulders.

                                     FURGESON
                         Sure does. Well... well. So what 
                         brings you here today?

                                     SAM
                         You're closing an account.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm closing an account.

                                     FURGESON
                         Well... wonderful. Do you have your 
                         account number?

                                     SAM
                         926-31043.

                                     ODA MAE
                         926-3143.

                                     SAM
                         31-0-43.

               She looks up into the air. Furgeson eyes her strangely.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm 
                         dyslexic.

               He punches Rita Miller's number into the computer. A figure 
               appears on the screen. He stares at it for a few seconds and 
               then punches it in again.

                                     FURGESON
                              (trying to be calm)
                         Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing 
                         four million dollars from us today, 
                         is that correct?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Four million dollars?!

                                     SAM
                         Say "yes"!

                                     ODA MAE
                              (gasping)
                         Yes! Four million. That's right. 
                         That's right.

                                     FURGESON
                         And how will you want that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Tens and twenties?

                                     FURGESON
                         Pardon?

                                     SAM
                         A cashier's check! Tell him a 
                         cashier's check.

                                     ODA MAE
                         A cashier's check.

                                     FURGESON
                         Fine. Of course, you realize we're 
                         required to get some identification 
                         from everyone. It's just procedural. 
                         You understand.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Of course.

               Oda Mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a DRIVER'S 
               LICENSE and a SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. Furgeson gets up and 
               walks away from his desk. He seems unsteady on his feet. An 
               OFFICER at the next desk is using a Brillo pad to clean a 
               stain on her desk. Oda Mae smiles.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You know, if you put that Brillo pad 
                         in the freezer, it'll last twice as 
                         long.

               The Officer nods appreciatively.

               INT. CARD FILE ROOM - DAY

               Furgeson lays Oda Mae's ID next to her signature card. The 
               signatures match up. He nods his head in approval.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY

               Carl looks up at the clock. It is 3:50. He pushes down a 
               button on the phone. A SECRETARY answers.

                                     SECRETARY (V.O.)
                         Yes, Mr. Bruner.

                                     CARL
                         Get me the First Island Bank of 
                         Nassau. It's on the rolodex.

               INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Mr. Furgeson returns with Rita Miller's signature card and a 
               cashier's check for $4,000,000. Oda Mae's hand shakes as she 
               examines it.

                                     FURGESON
                         I'll just need your signature right 
                         here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sure.

                                     SAM
                         Sign Rita Miller.

               Sam looks up and gulps. Molly has just entered the bank and 
               is heading toward them. He jumps up nervously.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         I'll be back in a minute. You're on 
                         your own. Don't say anything foolish.

               Oda Mae signs a form closing the account. Of course the 
               signatures match. Mr. Furgeson examines them both and smiles. 
               He shakes Oda Mae's hand.

                                     FURGESON
                         Now you be careful with this. It's 
                         like carrying cash, you know.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (positively glowing)
                         I sure do.

               Sam rushes over to Molly. He is not sure what to do. He 
               notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about 
               to pass. He hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a 
               hundred sheets, flying up into the air. Molly, confused, 
               thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up. Sam, 
               delighted, flicks another stack.

               Oda Mae is talking a blue streak when Sam returns to her.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Then my mother took all the money 
                         from the oil wells and put it in 
                         gasoline pumps. Every gas station 
                         has 'em you know, sometimes six or 
                         more. It adds up.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out 
                         of here. Say goodbye.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (abruptly getting up)
                         Well, I've got to leave. It's been a 
                         pleasure doin' business with you. 
                         Say "hi" to Shirley and Snooky for 
                         me.

                                     FURGESON
                         Thank you, Rita. I'll be glad to.

               Oda Mae smiles and leaves. There is a new lilt in her walk. 
               Suddenly Sam looks and sees Molly about to stand up.

                                     SAM
                         Hurry up, Oda Mae.

               At that second, Oda Mae spots a quarter lying on the ground. 
               She stoops down and picks it up.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (excitedly)
                         What a day!

               Molly sees her, does a double take, and starts to go after 
               her. Unfortunately, Oda Mae steps onto an elevator before 
               Molly can catch up. The doors close. Molly stops for a moment 
               and then looks back across to the executive area. She sees 
               Lionel Furgeson and hurries over to him.

                                     MOLLY
                         Lionel?

               He is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous.

                                     FURGESON
                         Molly. How are you?

                                     MOLLY
                         Lionel, a woman who just left, a 
                         black lady, about my height, did you 
                         see her?

                                     FURGESON
                         Well, yes. I just took care of her.

                                     MOLLY
                         What did she want? Did it have 
                         anything to do with me? Did she ask 
                         about Sam?

                                     FURGESON
                              (not understanding)
                         Sam? No. Why?

                                     MOLLY
                         Was her name Oda Mae Brown?

                                     FURGESON
                         No, Rita Miller. She just closed an 
                         account.

               Molly stares at Furgeson. She is not sure what to think.

                                     FURGESON
                              (continuing)
                         Is there a problem?

                                     MOLLY
                              (hesitating, not sure 
                              what to say)
                         No. I guess not. Thanks.

               She walks away, confused.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY

               Carl, in front of his computer, is going crazy. He keeps 
               punching buttons on the keyboard but the same response appears 
               over and over on the screen. "RITA MILLER, #926-31043. ACCOUNT 
               CLOSED. BALANCE $00.00."

               Panicked, Carl jumps up. He moves quickly, erratically around 
               the office and then back to the computer. He punches the 
               keys over and over. The same answer appears on the screen. 
               The account is closed.

               HALL OUTSIDE CARL'S OFFICE

               Carl runs through the office. He seems crazed. People look 
               at him.

                                     LEEDEN
                         Carl, is something wrong?

                                     CARL
                         Is someone playing with the computers?

                                     LEEDEN
                         What?

                                     CARL
                         Is this a joke? One of my accounts 
                         is closed.

                                     LEEDEN
                         Which account? What's wrong?

               Carl freezes. He doesn't answer.

                                     LEEDEN
                              (continuing)
                         You want me to call someone?

                                     CARL
                              (changing his demeanor)
                         No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's 
                         all right. I can do it.

               EXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Sam and Oda Mae are walking down the street in front of the 
               bank. Oda Mae is talking to herself.

                                     ODA MAE
                         $4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae. Take the check out of your 
                         purse.

               She stops. There is a nervous look on her face.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Take it out? Why?

                                     SAM
                         Just do it.

               Oda Mae, worried, removes the check but holds onto it tightly.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (in shock)
                         Endorse it? Why?

                                     SAM
                         Do what I say.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No!

                                     SAM
                         That's blood money, Oda. I was killed 
                         for that money. Endorse it now.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     SAM
                         We're giving it away.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Away? What do you mean? To who?

                                     SAM
                         Look to your left.

               Oda Mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless. 
               She recoils.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Are you outta your mind?

                                     SAM
                         Do what I tell you.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No!
                              (clutching the check)
                         I can't.

                                     SAM
                         Yes, you can. If you don't do it, 
                         they'll track you down. Your only 
                         protection is to get rid of it, now.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go 
                         to heaven for this.

               Oda Mae growls at him.

               With great difficulty, she approaches the nuns.

               The nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion.

                                     SAM
                         Write "St. Joseph's Shelter".

               With great hesitation, Oda Mae begins to write. We sense 
               that every word is a torment for her. The nuns politely avert 
               their eyes from the check.

                                     NUN
                         Bless you, child.

               Oda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over.

                                     SAM
                         I'm proud of you.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Don't you talk to me. I don't want 
                         you comin' round no more. I mean it. 
                         Understand?

                                     SAM
                         Come on, we're friends.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Friends? Friends?

               She turns on her high heels and wobbles away. Sam calls after 
               her.

                                     SAM
                         I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.

               She growls again. In the background we see the nuns secretly 
               peeking at the check. One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead 
               away. The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an 
               attempt to revive her.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               It is after hours. Almost everyone on the floor has gone. 
               Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands 
               on the keyboard. He looks haggard and worn.

               Sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the 
               monitor screen. Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches, 
               smiling.

                                     SAM
                         Search, you bastard! You'll never 
                         find it. It's gone.
                              (he smiles)
                         They'll kill you for this, Carl. You 
                         and Willie. They'll wipe you off the 
                         face of the earth.

               In a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against 
               the wall and the chair shoots across the room. Carl looks up 
               and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion, 
               and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate. Nothing 
               is working.

               Panicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and 
               storms furiously around the room. Sam approaches the computer, 
               hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The 
               computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around. He stares at the 
               computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off. 
               Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and FLICKS it 
               back on again. Carl stares at it.

                                     CARL
                         What the...?

               Carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and 
               letters begin appearing on the screen. He sits down, 
               mesmerized by what is happening. Then his face grows tense. 
               The word "M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R" is emerging before him.

               Carl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to 
               see who else is on the floor. He yells out like a madman.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Who's doing that?

               There is no one there. He hears the computer beginning to 
               type again and hurries back to look at the screen. One word 
               appears. "S-A-M".

               Carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist. It crashes 
               to the floor. Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for 
               breath.

               Sam cannot hold himself back any longer. With a horrifying 
               scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his 
               ribs.

                                     SAM
                         You bastard! You goddamn bastard!

               Carl grabs his side.

                                     CARL
                         Ah!

               He hits Carl again. Carl gasps in inexplicable pain.

                                     SAM
                         It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you 
                         have a date with Molly, you creepy 
                         son-of-a bitch?

               Sam keeps hitting deeper into Carl's mid-section. Carl doubles 
               over as though he's going to throw up.

                                     CARL
                         Jesus! Oh God!

               Sam is flushed with excitement. Carl kneels beside his desk. 
               He cannot understand what is happening to him. His face goes 
               stark white as the attack continues.

               Then, unexpectedly, the assault stops. Sam, exhausted, stares 
               hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor. Slowly 
               and dizzily, Carl gets up. He looks fearfully around the 
               office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room.

               INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT

               Molly, all dressed to go out, is sitting in Sam's easy chair, 
               asleep. Suddenly Carl arrives knocking at her door. He does 
               not look well. Sam is with him.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl? Where were you? I thought we 
                         were having...?

                                     CARL
                         I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy. 
                         I completely forgot.

                                     SAM
                         Old Carl had a little trouble at the 
                         office.

                                     MOLLY
                         Forgot? I was worried. Is everything 
                         okay? Are you all right?

                                     CARL
                         I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I 
                         talk to you for minute? Can I come 
                         in?

               Molly eyes Carl with concern as he enters the loft.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         I need to ask you a question.

                                     SAM
                         He needs to borrow four million 
                         dollars.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, I know what the police said, 
                         but when you thought Sam was here, 
                         when you thought he spoke to you, 
                         what did you feel? What did he say?

                                     MOLLY
                         Why? What happened?

                                     CARL
                              (very tense)
                         Molly, that psychic woman, I want to 
                         know what she told you. I want to 
                         know what she said.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax. 
                         I told you. It wasn't real. She's a 
                         charlatan.
                              (she hesitates and 
                              stares at Carl)
                         Does this have anything to do with 
                         her being at the bank today?

                                     SAM
                         Oh shit!

                                     CARL
                              (gulping)
                         At the bank?

               Sam tenses. He holds up his hand as if wanting her to stop.

                                     MOLLY
                         I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says 
                         she was taking out money. It turns 
                         out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. 
                         It's Rita Miller or something.

               Carl turns white. His eyes bulge. He feels sick.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         What's wrong?

                                     CARL
                         Stomach. My stomach. Do you have 
                         anything? Pepto Bismol.

                                     MOLLY
                              (worried)
                         Sure. Just a second. What's going 
                         on?

               Concerned, she hurries from the room. Sam digs his hands 
               into Carl's back. Carl jerks forward in intense pain and 
               begins flailing at the air.

                                     CARL
                         What are you doing to me. Get away! 
                         Get away!

               INT. KITCHEN

               Sam does not go away. Freaked, Carl runs into the kitchen 
               and rushes to the stove. Quickly he turns on the gas. He 
               looks crazed. Turning to the air, he begins whispering loudly.

                                     CARL
                         You touch me again and I'll set her 
                         on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her. 
                         I'll blow up the whole building if I 
                         have to. Stay away!

               Sam jabs at the knob on the stove and begins to turn it off. 
               Carl sees it move. Shocked and frightened, he grabs it and 
               pulls it off, leaving only the tiny stem in place.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Go on, try it again. Let me see you 
                         turn it off now.

               Sam, frightened, tries with all his might but he cannot twist 
               it. Carl pulls out a cigarette lighter and gloats.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if 
                         you hurt me.

               Sam rushes at Carl about to jam his full fist into his chest, 
               but then he stops, afraid. He pulls back, shaken. Carl stands 
               there waiting for a blow that doesn't come. He begins to 
               gloat.

                                     CARL
                         What's a matter? You believe me, 
                         huh? You better believe me! I want 
                         my money. I need that money and I 
                         want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that 
                         psychic lady doesn't bring it here, 
                         Molly's dead.

               Sam freezes. Molly enters the kitchen. She grabs her nose.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh my God. Is that the gas?

               Carl acts as if that's the reason he came into the kitchen.

                                     CARL
                         You must have left the stove on.

               He fiddles with the dials and turns it off.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Just glad I smelled it.

                                     MOLLY
                              (confused)
                         Me, too.

               She opens a window.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go. 
                         Look, there's something going on. I 
                         can't talk now. Some trouble at the 
                         bank.

                                     MOLLY
                         Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it 
                         that woman, the psychic?

                                     CARL
                         I don't have time to talk now. What 
                         if I come back? Around 11:00?

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, what's going on? Let me help 
                         you.

                                     CARL
                         I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but 
                         it's important. I'll be back.

               Molly is speechless.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Eleven!

               OMITTED

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Oda Mae is watching T.V. with Clara and Louise. Suddenly she 
               jumps, aware of Sam's presence in the room.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam!

               Clara and Louise jump, too.

                                     CLARA
                         Not again!

                                     ODA MAE
                         What're you doin' here?

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae! We're in trouble. They want 
                         the check. They're comin' to kill 
                         you. We gotta get outta here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         The check? What do you mean, "the 
                         check". You said they'd never find 
                         out.

                                     CLARA
                              (afraid)
                         What's happenin' Oda Mae?

               EXT. STREET

               A red Mustang SCREECHES to a stop on the street below. Sam 
               and Oda Mae run to the window. Carl and Willie are looking 
               up.

               INT. LIVINGROOM

                                     SAM
                         It's them.

                                     ODA MAE
                         They're comin' to kill me.
                              (to Sam, crazed)
                         What have you done?

               EXT. ODA MAE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Willie and Carl jump out of the car. They head for Oda Mae's 
               building.

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Sam steps back from the window.

                                     SAM
                         They're heading for the door.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (terrified)
                         Jesus have mercy.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Willie forces open a back door. They head into the building.

               INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Oda Mae and the others hurry into the hall. They rush down 
               the corridor and knock loudly on a neighbor's door. A WOMAN 
               opens it a crack.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Emergency! Let us in!

                                     WOMAN
                         Who you kiddin'?

               The Woman slams the door and locks it shut. Oda Mae looks 
               frightened.

               INT. APARTMENT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               Carl and Willie climb the stairs two at a time.

               INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Oda Mae and her sisters bang on another apartment door. No 
               one is home. Across the corridor an ELDERLY WOMAN sticks her 
               head out to see what is going on. Before she can say anything 
               they push their way inside.

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         What're you doin'? You can't come in 
                         here. The cat don't like visitors. 
                         She'll pee all over the couch. You 
                         wanna pay for...

               Oda Mae grabs the woman's mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - FISHEYE LENS VIEW

               just as Willie and Carl emerge from the stairwell. They head 
               down the hall toward Oda Mae's door. Willie pulls out a gun, 
               and fires. The lock shoots open. They rush inside.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               ODA MAE

               in the elderly woman's vestibule, peering through the 
               peephole. The old woman is struggling and still trying to 
               talk. Oda Mae's knees are wobbling.

                                     ODA MAE
                         They're gonna find us.

                                     SAM
                         No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that?

                                     SAM
                         Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I?

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Willie moves quickly through Oda Mae's apartment, his gun 
               pointed, ready to fire. He seems furious when he realizes no 
               one is there.

                                     WILLIE
                         Looks like someone just left.

                                     CARL
                         I'll check the building.

               ANGLE

               He rushes back out and down the stairs. Willie stays in the 
               apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS. Willie rushes over 
               and opens the door a crack. There is no one there. Confused, 
               he backs away. The doorbell rings again. Completely mystified, 
               he aims his gun and opens the door all the way. The hallway 
               is empty.

               As Willie stands there, wondering what is happening, Sam 
               steps inside and pushes the door closed. It slams shut. Willie 
               nearly jumps out of his skin.

                                     WILLIE
                         Damn!

               He stares at the door in total bewilderment. At that instant, 
               a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and 
               crashes into his legs. He backs away, spooked.

               Suddenly, the T.V. flicks ON at full volume and then the 
               STEREO and the RADIO. Lights begin flashing on and off. Willie 
               spins around in total dismay.

               Summoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie. Willie 
               recoils in unexplainable pain. He seems very disoriented. 
               His gun falls to the floor. He reaches for it and Sam pushes 
               it away. Willie jumps up, afraid. His eyes dart around the 
               room. Sam laughs.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         Who's there? Who's doing that?

               ANGLE

               A pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly 
               hit Willie in the head. He freaks. Grabbing his gun, Willie 
               runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot 
               water faucet turns on by itself.

               Willie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries 
               to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears 
               to dig his hands into his neck. Willie crumples to his knees.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh God!

               There is a SQUEAKING SOUND and Willie looks up. Letters are 
               appearing in the fogged mirror. He stares in disbelief as 
               the word "B-O-O!" emerges before him. He cries out.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         Let me outta here!

               Shaking uncontrollably, Willie FIRES his gun at the mirror. 
               Glass and tiles EXPLODE. Willie is cut and bleeding. He grabs 
               hold of the door and yanks it open.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Willie rushes to the hallway, charges for the back stairs 
               and stumbles down the three flights to the street. Carl, 
               running down the corridor, rushes after him. Willie drops 
               his gun. Carl picks it up.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

               Willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk. 
               People clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman. 
               Carl, confused, runs after him.

               Sam, too, races after Willie, unwilling to let him get away.

               Suddenly, a man obstructs his way. Willie goes flying over 
               him and lands face down on the cement. Before he can get up, 
               Sam is all over him and does not let up. People stand back 
               to watch as Willie does battle with himself. Panicked, he 
               calls out to a bystander.

                                     WILLIE
                         Help me!

               People back away. Carl watches in terror. He understands 
               exactly what is happening.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the 
               street. Cars are bearing down on him from all directions. He 
               does not get out of their way.

               One driver sees Willie coming and swerves to avoid him. His 
               car skids. Another car brakes to avoid a collision and 
               suddenly both cars crash right into him.

                                     CARL
                         Look out!

               Willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles 
               as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and 
               writhing. His ghostly form reaches out to people for help as 
               they rush past. No one stops.

               Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the 
               street. Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body 
               lying there. He begins to scream.

               A bizarre and frightening CLICKING SOUND fills the air. Sam 
               looks up. A group of strange dark figures has emerged from 
               the shadows.

               With a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down 
               and grab hold of Willie. Sam freezes. In an instant they are 
               dragging Willie, kicking and screaming, down through the 
               sewer grates into the bowels of the earth.

               ANGLE

               Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror. Carl, standing 
               in the crowd, turns and runs.

               INT. OLD LADY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Oda Mae and her sisters are huddling with the old woman in 
               the entryway to her apartment. They all appear frightened. 
               The door is opened a crack and they can see people gathering 
               in the hall outside.

               Sam walks up to Oda Mae. She feels his presence.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam? What happened?

                                     SAM
                         He's dead, Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Dead!
                              (she utters a sigh of 
                              relief)
                         Oh, thank God. It's over.

                                     SAM
                         No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's 
                         still Carl.

               Oda Mae freezes. She turns to Sam.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Who's Carl?

               INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

               Sam and Oda Mae are in a taxi speeding downtown.

                                     SAM
                         Tell him to hurry!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Can't you hurry up?

                                     DRIVER
                         Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I 
                         can.

               Sam leans forward and pushes at the gas pedal. The cab shoots 
               forward. The driver seems shocked.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Problems?

               He gives her a dirty look.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               There is a KNOCK at the door. Molly goes to it. Fastening 
               the latch, she opens it a crack.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, is that you?

               Oda Mae wedges her foot inside.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you 
                         think of me, but your life is in 
                         danger. You have to listen to me. 
                         Sam's here, too. You gotta let us 
                         in.

               Molly tries to slam the door but hits Oda Mae's foot.

                                     MOLLY
                         Get the hell out of here. I'm calling 
                         the police.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Go ahead. We want you to call 'em. 
                         You're in trouble. Let us in.

                                     MOLLY
                         No!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam's death was no accident. He was 
                         murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering 
                         money at the bank. Sam found out. 
                         He's dangerous. He tried to kill me. 
                         He'll kill you, too.

                                     MOLLY
                              (screaming)
                         Why are you doing this to me? Get 
                         away from me! I know all about you. 
                         You're a fake. You're just a fake. 
                         Leave me alone!

               We see Sam's inside the room with Molly. He gazes at her 
               lovingly for a moment and then calls back to Oda Mae.

                                     SAM
                         Tell her she's wearing the blouse I 
                         spilled the Margarita on and the 
                         earrings I gave her for Christmas.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam says you're wearin' the blouse 
                         he spilled the Margarita on and the 
                         earrings he gave you at Christmas.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               MOLLY

               grabbing hold of her beads. Her hand is shaking.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         See, I'm no fake.

                                     MOLLY
                         Go away!

                                     SAM
                         Gimme a penny quick.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What?

                                     SAM
                         Empty your purse. On the floor. Now.

               Oda Mae obeys. A pile of coins falls on the floor.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Push a penny under the door.

               Oda Mae obeys and a penny slides into the loft. Molly sees 
               it. Sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the 
               bottom of the door. Pushing gently, he moves the penny up 
               the door until it's eye level with Molly. She watches it, 
               amazed.

               Then, to her astonishment, the penny floats away from the 
               door and hovers in the air. There is a look of wonder in 
               Molly's eyes as it floats toward her.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing; calling 
                              to Oda Mae)
                         Tell her it's for luck.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                         Sam says it's for luck.

               Molly stands there dumbfounded. Her face is completely white. 
               After a moment she reaches for the penny. It falls into her 
               hand. There are tears in her eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HALLWAY

               Oda Mae standing in the hallway as the door to the loft begins 
               to open. Slowly Molly steps out onto the landing and stares 
               at her, nervously, uncomprehendingly. She hesitates for a 
               long moment and then invites Oda Mae in.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Molly is on the phone. Oda Mae is beside her.

                                     MOLLY
                         Right. Yes, it's right on the corner. 
                         We're a red brick building with the 
                         entrance on the left side. Please 
                         hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be 
                         waiting right here.
                              (she hangs up)
                         Police are on their way.

               Oda Mae takes her and leads her to the couch.

                                     MOLLY
                         What do we do now?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Just wait.

               There is a period of awkward silence.

                                     MOLLY
                         Is Sam here?

                                     SAM
                         I'm sitting beside you.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (pointing)
                         Right here.

               Molly reaches out tentatively. Sam meets her hand. She 
               flinches for a second but does not pull back.

                                     MOLLY
                              (fingering the air)
                         Can you feel me, Sam?

                                     SAM
                         With all my heart.

                                     ODA MAE
                         With all his heart, he says.

                                     SAM
                         I'd give anything to be alive again, 
                         just to feel you once more.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He wishes he could touch you, just 
                         one more time.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh, Sam.

               Oda Mae looks away uncomfortably. The CAMERA HOLDS on her 
               face. After a moment she turns around and addresses the air.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Okay, damn it, you can use me if you 
                         want.

               Sam looks oddly at Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Come on. Before I change my mind.

               Suddenly he understands what she means.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JUKEBOX

               Sam's finger presses down two keys. We see a record slide 
               out of its slot and move toward the turntable. We know what 
               it is going to play.

               ANGLE

               Oda Mae closes her eyes. "Unchained Melody" begins to play. 
               Sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously, awkwardly 
               slides his ghostly body into her solid form. We sense Oda 
               Mae's discomfort gradually give way as Sam emerges inside 
               her. After a second her body turns slowly toward Molly.

               Oda Mae's hand reaches out and with slow, deliberate gestures, 
               touches Molly's hand. Molly swallows hard. She closes her 
               eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               Sam. It is as though he alone is there with Molly. His eyes 
               are full of tears. He can barely move. His hand glides slowly 
               down Molly's cheek. He seems to be in a state of ecstasy and 
               pain.

               The experience is more than he can bear. He pulls back.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam!

               Molly reaches out, takes Sam's hand, and guides it to her 
               soft lips. Sam can barely breathe. He seems totally absorbed 
               in the experience, the sensation of human flesh.

               His eyes are absolutely still and full of light. He seems to 
               be glowing.

               Gently, Molly takes Sam's arm and guides him to his feet. 
               Effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft. 
               With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before 
               he knows what is happening, they are dancing. It is a strange, 
               touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their 
               new home. Sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down 
               over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips. 
               She stands motionless. Her face shines. She knows beyond all 
               doubt that it is him.

                                     MOLLY
                         I love you so much.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               A LOUD JARRING SOUND. It takes a moment to realize that it 
               is someone KNOCKING at the door. The light slams back into 
               its shadowy substance and Sam comes shooting back into his 
               ghostly form. Oda Mae is standing with Molly in the center 
               of the room. Sam is beside them. He appears shaken and dizzy.

               There is a another loud POUNDING at the door.

                                     MOLLY
                         The police!

               Molly heads for the door. Sam calls out. He can barely speak.

                                     SAM
                         No!

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to Molly)
                         Wait!

               Sam tries to go instead. To his amazement and ours he is 
               extremely weak, barely able to move.

                                     SAM
                         What's happening to me?

               His ghostly functions are diminishing.

               There is another KNOCK and a voice rings out.

                                     CARL (O.S.)
                         Molly, open up. It's me.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's Carl!

                                     SAM
                         Get out of here! The fire escape.

               Oda Mae grabs Molly.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Come with me.

               Oda Mae and Molly run for the fire escape window. We hear 
               Carl yelling in the hallway.

                                     CARL (O.S.)
                         Molly. Open up. Are you there?

               INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               Carl is standing on the landing. He is holding a gun. He 
               aims it at the lock and FIRES. The door to the loft flies 
               open.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Carl moves rapidly through the huge space.

                                     CARL
                         Molly!

               It is obvious that no one's home.

               ANGLE

               Sam, with great effort, rushes at Carl and attacks him with 
               his fists. To his great shock, he has no impact. Carl walks 
               right through him.

               EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               Molly and Oda Mae are climbing the fire escape.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Carl runs to the fire escape window. He looks out just in 
               time to see Oda Mae go into the 7th story window.

               INT. NEW LOFT - NIGHT

               Molly and Oda Mae run through a new loft that is under 
               construction. It is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls. 
               The fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them 
               half to death. They rush blindly toward the front door. It 
               won't open.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Back to the fire escape. Head for 
                         the roof.

               Oda Mae reaches the fire escape window just as Carl appears 
               on the other side. She screams. Carl tries shoving the window 
               open. It won't budge.

               Molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight. There 
               is an opening at the top.

                                     MOLLY
                         This way!

               Molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the 
               roof.

               With a huge shove, Carl opens the window and rushes inside. 
               The window slams behind him.

               Oda Mae rushes back toward Molly, but her foot catches on a 
               loose cable and she falls to the ground.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Help us, Sam!

               OMITTED

               ODA MAE

               A hand falls on Oda Mae's shoulder. She spins around. Carl 
               is standing behind her. She screams as he knocks her to the 
               floor.

                                     CARL
                         I want the check. Just give me the 
                         check.

               Molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream.

                                     MOLLY
                              (screaming)
                         God almighty, Carl! What are you 
                         doing? What have you done!?

               She descends quickly and runs toward Carl.

                                     CARL
                         Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's 
                         not her money.

               Carl kicks Oda Mae. Molly rushes at him, attacking him 
               violently. Carl aims his gun at her.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Keep out of this, Molly!

               He grabs Oda Mae by the hair.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Where is it?

               Oda Mae cries out.

                                     ODA MAE
                         In my purse.

                                     CARL
                         Where?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Over there.

               She points across the room.

               Carl sees the purse and yanks Oda Mae toward it. Yanking it 
               off the floor, he tears through it like a wild man. There is 
               no check. He grabs Oda Mae.

                                     CARL
                         Where is it, goddamn it? Where is 
                         it?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I gave it away.

                                     CARL
                         You're lying! Don't lie to me!

               He aims his gun at her eye and is about to FIRE when, 
               suddenly, something shoves him to the floor. Carl screams 
               and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae. Sam is standing there.

               In total panic, Carl scrambles to get up. Horrified, he SHOOTS 
               his gun blindly into the air. Molly and Oda Mae dive for 
               cover. The bullets have no impact. Sam musters all his 
               strength and shoves Carl again. White with fear, Carl grabs 
               Molly and aims his gun at her head.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll 
                         kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give 
                         me the check.

               The gun is cocked at her temple. No one moves. Slowly the 
               camera dollies toward Carl.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Sam, please. I didn't mean for him 
                         to kill you. It's not my fault. Come 
                         on, Sam, give me the check. Give it 
                         to me and I'll leave her alone.

               Nothing happens. Carl looks nervous.

               ANGLE

                                     CARL
                         Sam? Sam?

               In a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at 
               his gun. The weapon flies out of Carl's hand. Empowered by 
               an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with 
               a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and 
               floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack.

               Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the 
               floor. With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the 
               door. The lock explodes and the door flies open.

               Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With 
               growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment, 
               colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to 
               the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The 
               apartment looks like a scene from another world.

               Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from 
               Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he 
               scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot 
               see him.

               Carl shoves at the window. It is stuck. With a supreme effort, 
               he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass. 
               Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing 
               the window. Shards of glass fly in all directions. Sam turns 
               and sees Carl. He surges after him, but knows he cannot get 
               to him in time.

               Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an 
               electrical box attached to a dangling BX cable. It goes flying 
               toward the window. To his amazement, it hits the frame. A 
               huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. Carl 
               looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his 
               chest. Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs 
               and slices into his heart. His body quivers.

               Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to 
               spasm. He can't get up. A look of abject terror flashes 
               through his eyes. He tries to scream. There is no sound. He 
               tries to breathe. There is no breath.

               ANGLE

               With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement, 
               his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks 
               down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is 
               gone. There is no blood. Excited and confused, he turns around 
               and sees Sam. For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is 
               happening.

                                     CARL
                         Sam?

               There is a strange, silent moment between them.

               Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible CLICKING sound is 
               heard. Frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness. 
               Carl looks behind him and gasps. Past the figures coming 
               toward him, he sees his own dead body. It is pinned to the 
               window sill.

               Before Carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and 
               envelope him. In a flash, his spirit is caught and surges 
               with the dark forces back into the shadows. Far in some 
               invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream.

               And then it is silent. It is over.

               ANGLE

               Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly 
               against the wall. She is staring into space. The room is 
               filled with plaster dust. Slowly, emerging from the dust, we 
               see Sam approaching Molly. He gazes at her with terrible 
               longing.

               Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling 
               and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. Sam 
               turns to look at it. His eyes are full of surprise and wonder. 
               The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. As he 
               looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. 
               His body is beginning to fade. A faint smile forms on his 
               face. He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long, 
               silent moment.

                                     SAM
                         Goodbye, Moll.

               Molly's head lifts up. She looks around.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam? Is that you?

                                     SAM
                              (stunned)
                         Molly?!

                                     MOLLY
                         I hear you, Sam.

               She starts to cry.

               Gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near Molly is 
               beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow. To her astonishment, 
               Sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Oh God!

               Sam's luminous form appears before her. Molly is overwhelmed 
               by the sight of him. The two of them gaze at one another 
               without moving. They know it is for the last time. It is a 
               silent exchange, charged with emotion.

               Slowly, the two bodies reach forward. As their lips touch, 
               the plaster dust swirls sensuously through Sam's vaporous 
               image and he begins to disappear. Molly pulls back from him 
               as though from a cloud. His voice rises from the mist.

                                     SAM
                         I can't stay anymore.

               Tears roll down her cheek.

               The brilliant light intensifies. It is beautiful, like a 
               sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow. 
               Molly looks up and sees it all. Oda Mae sees it, too.

                                     ODA MAE
                         They're waiting for you, Sam.

                                     SAM
                              (smiling)
                         I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae.
                              (with deep felt 
                              gratitude)
                         Thank you. Your mama would be proud.

               Oda Mae smiles warmly.

               Sam turns to Molly. She is gazing at the last remaining 
               moments of him. Her eyes brim over with tears and love.

                                     SAM
                         I love you, Molly. I've always loved 
                         you.

               Molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Ditto.

               The light inside Sam intensifies. A sweet smile emerges on 
               his lips.

                                     SAM
                         It's so amazing, Moll...

               His face fills with joy.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         The love inside.

               He whispers, almost crying.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         You take it with you.

               They are his last words. His spirit dissolves within its 
               ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate. Molly looks up 
               silently for a moment, her face filled with love.

                                     MOLLY
                         See ya.

               We see Sam's spirit rise from the room. It passes effortlessly 
               through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. The room 
               grows dark.

               Molly sits quietly on the floor. There is a look of awe and 
               wonder in her eyes. After a moment, Oda Mae reaches down to 
               help her up. Molly looks at her lovingly and then gently 
               takes her hand. Arm in arm, supporting one another, they 
               walk quietly from the room.

                                         THE END
