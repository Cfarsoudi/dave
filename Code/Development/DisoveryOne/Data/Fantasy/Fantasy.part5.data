          The dragonhead prow of an ancient Viking ship cuts through the 
          thick fog of the rough North Atlantic Sea.

          Viking explorer LEIF ERICSON carefully studies his fob compass as 
          he dangles it above a parchment map. His SAILORS steal nervous 
          looks at a large, diabolical-looking IRON BOX in the hold.
           
          OLAF, a fierce, one-eyed Viking warrior approaches Ericson. NOTE: 
          Dialog is in OLD NORSE, with SUBTITLES)
           
          OLAF
          Leif, let's do the deed
          before another night falls. The crew's
          near mutiny.
           
          Ericson draws his broadsword with a flourish.
           
          LEIF ERICSON
          Know this! The first man to turn
          will taste my steel in his guts.
           
          OLAF
          But we've surely gone far enough.
           
          ERICSON
          That accursed box must be thrown
          off the edge of the world. We
          will go until we can go no more...
           
          Suddenly there is an ear-splitting SCREECH and the entire boat 
          rocks violently as it runs aground.
           
          The LOOKOUT is thrown from his crow's nest... and CRASHES 
          straight through the deck right in front of Ericson. His pained 
          voice floats up 
          from the black hole.
           
          LOOKOUT
          ...Land ho.
           
          Ericson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow.

          Olaf finishes digging a hole in the sand. He backs away, 
          terrified, as burly Vikings, led by Ericson, muscle the IRON BOX 
          over to the hole and 
          quickly bury it. Ericson turns to an exotic-looking Eurasian 
          WITCH.
           
          ERICSON
          Be quick, Witch. Let the deed
          be done.
           
          The Witch unravels a scroll and recites:
           
          WITCH
          Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief
          dwell now in waters, base and
          bland. And in waves and sand thy
          magic forever sleep...
           
          As the Witch speaks, a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of 
          clouds appears. The sky explodes in THUNDER and LIGHTNING. The 
          MEN 
          look about fearfully.
           
          ERICSON (CONT.)
          Back to the ship men, hurry.
           
          OLAF
          Captain, you've discovered a new
          world. It is your right to name it.
           
          ERICSON
          Leave that to the Italians. We're
          never coming back here. Never.
          This land is now cursed.

          Suddenly the PIPELINE BREAKS FREE, crushing the diver and 
          cracking open the box.
           
          SOMETHING (seen only in rippling shadow) explodes out of the box

          CHARLIE
          Look at those clouds rollin' in,
          man. Freaky weather.
           
          STANLEY IPKISS, a bright0eyed amiable young account exec pauses 
          by Charlie's desk and drops off a print-out.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey Charlie, can you go over these
          stats? We're supposed to have
          a complete report before lunch.
           
          Charlie takes one looks at the complex print-outs and tosses them 
          back.
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had
          my weave tightened and my head
          is killing me. Be a pal and take
          those over to Hinkleman, will ya?
           
          MAGGIE, a cute young blonde now strolls by.
           
          MAGGIE
          Hi guys. Did you have any luck
          with those concert tickets
          Stanley?
           
          Stanley perks up at the sight of her.
           
          STANLEY
          I sure did. Friday night, just
          like you wanted.
           
          MAGGIE
          Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful.
           
          STANLEY
          What time should I pick you up?
           
          MAGGIE
          Gee, I don't know. My best
          girlfriend just got into town and
          I know she'd love to go. Can we
          get an extra ticket for her?
           
          STANLEY
          Well... uh, actually it's sold
          out. I was kinda lucky to get
          these.
           
          MAGGIE
          She's only going to be in town
          a couple of days and I just can't
          let her sit at home all alone.
          Are you sure there isn't something
          we can do?
           
          Stanley considers the situation for a moment, then pulls the 
          tickets out of his pocket.
           
          STANLEY
          You know what? Here. You two
          go.
           
          MAGGIE
          Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that.
           
          STANLEY
          No really. Go ahead. It's okay.
          I hate concerts anyway. All that,
          you know... music floating around.
           
          Maggie snatches the tickets from Stanley's hand.
           
          MAGGIE
          That is so sweet. Sheila's just
          going to love this.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe you and I can get
          together over the weekend?
           
          MAGGIE
          I'm not sure what's going on, but
          just give me a call. You know
          I like to be spontaneous.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, sure. Me too.
           
          MAGGIE
          Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest
          guy.
           
          Maggie gives him a quick air-kiss and hurries off to her teller's 
          window.
           
          CHARLIE
          That's it.
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          The kiss of death. As soon as
          they use the "N" word it's all
          over.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe I am a nice guy. So
          what?
           
          CHARLIE
          You are a rug. I am talking
          astro-turf here. You're letting
          these women sharpen their cleats
          on you.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they
          can't appreciate that, it's their
          problem.
           
          CHARLIE
          You spend too much time being
          "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up
          sittin' around listening to her
          complain about the son of a bitch
          she really loves.
           
          STANLEY
          Charlie, you are a very sick
          puppy.
           
          CHARLIE
          Wake up, Stanley! These are the
          nineties. We're dealing with an
          entire generation of dysfunctional
          love junkies. You can't romance
          'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's
          the only thing that gets their
          attention.
          (PAUSES)
          Let me demonstrate. You see that
          girl over there?
           
          Stanley looks over at the coffee service where an attractive 
          young WOMAN is pouring herself a cup of coffee.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          Hi Lisa.
           
          LISA
          (forgets his name)
          Oh, hi...
           
          CHARLIE
          Charlie.
           
          LISA
          That's right. Sorry.
           
          CHARLIE
          Lisa, this may seem a little odd,
          but my friend over there and I
          were having this discusion and
          I thought maybe you could settle
          it for us.
           
          LISA
          I'll help out if I can.
           
          CHARLIE
          (SHEEPISHLY)
          Actually, I don't know... this
          is kind of a personal question.
           
          LISA
          That's okay. Go ahead.
           
          CHARLIE
          Alright. Just for the sake of
          argument, if I wasn't a happily
          married man... am I the kind of
          guy you'd go out with?
           
          LISA
          Oh, um... I don't know.
          (PAUSES)
          Well... yeah. I guess I would.
           
          CHARLIE
          Lisa, I have terrific news for
          you.
           
          LISA
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          I'm not married! Is this perfect
          or what? Listen, there's not a
          lot of women willing to come right
          out like that and admit they're
          attracted to a guy, but...
           
          Lisa SLAPS Charlie, turns on her heel, and marches off.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          Jeez... make up your mind.
           
          Stanley gives Charlie the fish eye as he returns.
           
          CHARLIE
          Okay. Bad example. Some
          of these women got so much baggage
          they need an emotional sky cap.
          I'll tell you what Stanley,
          tonight I'm gonna take you on a
          love safari, deep into the darkest
          heart of the urban jungle.
           
          STANLEY
          And where's that?
           
          CHARLIE
          The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new
          club in town. It's a guaranteed
          skirt alert and no dead beats
          allowed.
           
          STANLEY
          So how are we gonna get in?
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah, do I detect a little
          self-image problem there, buddy?
          You just leave everything to me.
          This, my friend is going to be
          the perfect night on the town.
           
          Suddenly a resounding peal of THUNDER rings out like the crack of 
          doom. Sheets of rain pour down on the bank's windows.

          Pedestrians scramble for cover in the sudden downpour.
           
          INT. BANK - FOYER
           
          A young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her 
          head. She's soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to straighten 
          herself out.
           
          Charlie immediately notices her...
           
          CHARLIE
          Hold the phone. Killer at three
          o'clock.
           
          Stanley follows his gaze.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.
           
          CAMERA does a classic CHEESECAKE TILT-UP starting with the 
          woman's million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the water out 
          of her 
          skirt... up past her body, which through her damp summer clothes 
          is undeniable proof that there is a God... up... up... to her 
          face as that 
          newspaper is tossed aside. She's a heart-stopping woman/child 
          with a Cupid's bow mouth and ice blue eyes. In other words she's 
          trouble. 
          Big trouble, also known as TINA CARLYLE.
           
          Charlie may as well have just seen the Virgin of Guadalupe.
           
          CHARLIE
          (hushed reverence)
          Oh my god... A perfect dime. The
          dame of dames. The Moby of my
          dick.
           
          STANLEY
          Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your
          eyes.
           
          Tina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie.
           
          TINA
          Excuse me, where can I open a new
          account?
           
          Charlie flashes his best 100 watt smile.
           
          CHARLIE
          You've come to the right place,
          ma'am. Just step right this way
          and pull up a chair...
           
          Charlie tries to steer Tina to his desk, but she's still 
          preoccupied with her damp clothing.
           
          TINA
          Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete
          wreck. Will you hold this please?
           
          She hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet 
          blazer, creating another awe-inspiring visual moment.
           
          CHARLIE
          Here, let me take that for you.
           
          Charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles.
           
          TINA
          Thanks.
           
          But Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at 
          his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it.
           
          STANLEY
          So, uh, what kind of account did
          you have in mind?
           
          TINA
          (smiles sweetly)
          Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
          just terrible with things like
          that. That's an interesting tie
          Mr...?
           
          STANLEY
          Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss...
           
          Tina extends her hand.
           
          TINA
          Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet
          you.
           
          STANLEY
          The, uh... pleasure's all mine.
           
          Tina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanley's desk.
           
          TINA
          May I? I'm such a mess.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh... of course.
           
          Tina takes out a compact and daintily blots the moisture from her 
          face.
           
          TINA
          As I was saying about that tie. It's
          like one of those, what do you
          call them, ink blot tests.
           
          STANLEY
          A Rorschach test.
           
          She twists open a tube of lip gloss andbegins to run it across 
          her incredibly lush liips.
           
          TINA
          That's it. It looks like... um.
          A young woman riding bareback.
          You know, like a Lady Godiva or
          something.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? I don't think I can...
           
          She slowly runs a finger along Stanley's tie.
           
          TINA
          Or... if that's not a horse it
          could be two lovers. A man and
          a woman. That would be the woman
          on top, of course.
           
          STANLEY
          (MESMERIZED)
          ...Of course.
           
          She licks her lips and blots them on the Kleenex, leaving a 
          perfect kiss impression and drops it on Stanley's desk.
           
          TINA
          What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?
           
          Stanley starts to get uncomfortable under her gaze.
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know. ...Bold colors.
          It's a power tie, y'know? They're
          supposed to make you feel...
          powerful.
           
          TINA
          Does it work?
           
          STANLEY
          Sort of. It's just a tie. Now,
          about that account.
           
          CLOSE-UP
           
          as Tina drops her compact back in her shoulder bag and we see her 
          flick a red L.E.D. light on. She carefully adjusts the bag, 
          aiming a tiny 
          CAMERA LENS neatly concealed within it.
           
          Tina's pointing the bag at the open bank vault that stands a 
          short distance from Stanley's desk.

          Dorian sips nervously on a Yoo-Hoo as he watches the show.
           
          DORIAN
          That's it sweetheart. A little

          His two gunsels, SWEET EDDY and CHUN WOO are busy at the back of

          DORIAN
          Yeah, well the meter's runnin'
          on this one. We got less than
          a week.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Not cool. What about the coin?
           
          DORIAN
          There's plenty. And I'll be happy
          to invest your share.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          What you talkin' about, man?

          This isn't about the lousy couple
          hundred thou' that's sitting in

          We gotta expand your horizons
          Doctor. Take a look.
           
          Dorian pulls back a curtain. An amazingly gaudy building stands 
          on a pier across the river from Dorian's club. A huge sign across

          World class sucker bait. The
          grand opening is Saturday night
          and it will drive this two bit
          club of mine out of existence.
          But I say if you can't beat 'em,
          take 'em over.

          Yeah? That's Arnie the Swede's

          Leave him to me. You pull off
          this heist and I promise you,

          A large WHARF RAT now creeps out along the garbage sniffing 
          curiously at its timeworn wooden surface. It takes a tentative 
          nibble.

          EXT. CITY STREET - EARLY EVENING
           
          Stanley and Charlie are riding along at breakneck speed in a taxi 
          cab.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it up right here, please.
           
          A gun port suddenly SLAMS open and the wild-eyed Albanian TAXI 
          DRIVER wheels about and cocks a huge .45 from his side of the 
          BULLET 
          riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic.
           
          DRIVER
          Hold up?! No hold up! I keel
          you very well! I splatter your
          guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man!
           
          Stanley dives for cover.
           
          CHARLIE
          No! No! He only wants you to
          stop the cab!
           
          The driver instantly SLAMS on the brakes, throwing his passengers 
          forward mercilessly.
           
          DRIVER
          (now totally calm)
          Hokay. Pardon you very much.
           
          Charlie helps Stanley sit back up.
           
          CHARLIE
          It's alright, Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTLY)
          I hate this town. I really hate
          this town.
           
          CHARLIE
          Why are you getting out here?
           
          STANLEY
          I gotta pick up my car.
           
          CHARLIE
          Fine. Now don't forget. Ten
          o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've
          already got us lined up with a
          couple of authentic dimes.
           
          Stanley steps out of the cab.
           
          STANLEY
          Charlie, please. The last time
          you said that you showed up with
          two lesbian mud-wrestlers.
           
          CHARLIE
          Well, I can't promise we'll get
          that lucky again... Later!

          Stanley enters the grease spattered, cluttered garage and scans 
          the area for signs of life. We can hear the CLANK-CLANK-CRASH of 
          SOME 
          less than light-fingered automotive work in progress.
           
          Stanley DINGS a little service bell sitting on a counter 
          plastered with naked playmate decoupage and Mrs. Power Tool '93 
          calendars.
           
          STANLEY
          ...Hello?
           
          IRV, a lumbering unshaven behemoth of a man with permanently low-
          slung refrigerator repairman pants, makes his way past half 
          rebuilt car 
          carcasses towards Stanley.
           
          IRV
          Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your
          panties in a twist.
           
          BURT, a thinner version of Irv with Coke bottle glasses and a mop 
          of greasy hair, pops up from beneath a car, RIPS out of chunk of 
          motor and 
          wiring and holds it up to Irv.
           
          BURT
          (examining part)
          Hey Irv, what the hell is this?
           
          IRV
          (eyes it carefully)
          Ohh... I dunno. About seven
          hundred bucks.
           
          They both laugh evilly as Irv slaps Burt on the back. Irv makes 
          his way over to Stanley, still chuckling to himself.
           
          IRV
          Now what can I do for you, Bub?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm here for the Civic.
           
          IRV
          Japanese car, right? Kind of a
          nasty pea soup green?
           
          STANLEY
          Well, they call it Emeral Forest,
          actually...
           
          Irv turns back to Burt.
           
          IRV
          Burt! Pea green Civic!
           
          Burt pops back up from beneath the hood.
           
          BURT
          Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh
          yeah! Brake drums are still on
          order and I'm only halfway through
          rebuilding the trans.
           
          STANLEY
          But I just brought it in for an
          oil change!
           
          IRV
          Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught
          those other problems before they
          caused some serious trouble.
           
          STANLEY
          Alright. Alright. When will it
          be ready?
           
          Irv looks over at Burt, who gives him a "Make something up" look.
           
          IRV
          Come back tomorro...
          (Burt shakes his head "no".)
          ...First thing next wee...
          (Burt shakes again)
          ...next month?
          (Burt shakes an enthusiastic "yes".)
          Yeah, first thing next month.
          That's if we can get the parts.
           
          STANLEY
          What am I going to do in the
          meantime? I can't afford to keep
          taking cabs all over town.
           
          Irv smiles a rotten-toothed smile.
           
          IRV
          Oh, hell... we can take care of
          that!
          (to Burt archly)
          Hey Burt, bring around the loaner.
          (to Stanley)
          And for you little buddy, only
          ten bucks a day.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT
           
          The joint is jumping with musclehead BOUNCERS picking and 
          choosing from the crowd of terminally trendy WANNABE'S gathered 
          around the 
          entrance. A light drizzle is falling.
           
          A parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as CAR HOPS scurry to 
          keep up with the flow;
           
          A glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce.
           
          A fire engine red Ferrari.
           
          A classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy.
           
          And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle 
          gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled 
          Stanley behind 
          the wheel.
           
          A car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut. 
          Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops 
          open with a SCREECH of 
          metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street.
           
          He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain 
          at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood.
           
          STANLEY
          It's a classic.
           
          The car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a 
          horrible GRINDING. He finally waves over two other car hops who 
          quickly push 
          it off down the street.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What
          is that, a Rolls Canardley?
           
          STANLEY
          A what?
           
          CHARLIE
          You know, a Rolls Canardley.
          Rolls down one hill canardley roll
          up the next.
          (he cracks up)
           
          STANLEY
          We are not discussing the car,
          okay?
           
          CHARLIE
          Whatever you say, man.
           
          Charlie gestures expansively towards the club.
           
          CHARLIE
          What do you think? Pretty
          terrific, huh? This place make
          Sodom and Gomorrah look like
          Mayberry.
           
          Stanley now notices a life-sized poster of Tina Carlyle standing 
          by the main entrance that reads "Featuring the Musical Stylings 
          of Miss Tina 
          Carlyle."
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, isn't that...
           
          CHARLIE
          Right. The wet dream from the
          bank.

          Hold on... I think I see my future
          ex-wife.
           
          Two rather tacky looking GIRLS beckon Charlie from the crowd.
           
          GIRLS
          Hey Charlie! Charlie!
           
          CHARLIE
          (WAVES)
          We're in luck. It's Barbie and
          Pebbles.
           
          STANLEY
          Doesn't it bother you that all
          the women you know are named after
          cartoon characters?
           
          Barbie and Pebbles hurry over through the crowd.
           
          BARBIE
          We've been waiting out here for
          hours. Can you get us in?
           
          CHARLIE
          No, problemo. Ladies, this is my
          pal Stanley Ipkiss.
          (leans closer)
          Stanley's very influential in the
          banking business.
           
          Charlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the 
          crowd dragging his entourage with him.
           
          EXT. THE FRONT DOOR
           
          Charlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry 
          way's velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking BOUNCERS 
          that guard the 
          door.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's
          happening man?
           
          Bobby completely ignores Charlie as he ushers a pasty faced ROCK 
          STAR and his underage TARTLET past the ropes.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          (to the girls)
          This will just take a second.
          (to the other bouncer)
          Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie!
           
          Nick is also completely oblivious.
           
          STANLEY
          Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to
          stand here waiting to be judged
          by these power-mad steroid
          jockeys.
           
          CHARLIE
          How much cash you got on you?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          You heard me. How much you got?
           
          STANLEY
          I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hand it over.
           
          STANLEY
          No way.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only
          carrying plastic. C'mon man, you
          want to stand out here all night?
           
          Stanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash. Charlie 
          snatches the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the 
          ropes.
           
          CHARLIE
          (subtly flashing bills)
          Hey Bobby!
           
          Bobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up.
           
          BOBBY
          Charlie, how you doin' man? Long
          time no see.
           
          Bobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake he 
          longs for.
           
          The crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step 
          by, briefly cutting Stanley off.
           
          He catches up just as the all-important rope is SNAPPED closed.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!
           
          But Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside. 
          Dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's 
          list.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          I'm with them! Hey, Bobby!
           
          But Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine. Stanley unsnaps 
          the rope himself and starts throgh. Bobby and BOUNCER #2 
          IMMEDIATELY 
          grab Stanley and quickly subdue him.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey! Leggo... awk!
           
          Dorian glares at Stanley.
           
          DORIAN
          Lose him.
           
          The bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously 
          toss him out into the rain-slick street.
           
          ANGLE ON THE STREET
           
          Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A 
          horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings 
          into the 
          club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water.
           
          Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina 
          Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR 
          carrying an umbrella. 
          She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting 
          a losing battle to restrain her decolletage.
           
          Their EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him.
           
          TINA
          (SMILES)
          Oh... Stanley. Hi.
           
          Stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little 
          wave hello anyway.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          Are you okay?
           
          Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose 
          against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls.
           
          With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the 
          car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him.
           
          Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the 
          car hop's tip money... nothing.
           
          He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. 
          The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of 
          NOXIOUS 
          exhaust fumes.
           
          DISSOLVE TO:
           
          EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT
           
          A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear 
          Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually 
          pulls into 
          sight on the dark rain-slick street.
           
          INT. CAR
           
          Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine 
          starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies.
           
          EXT. BRIDGE
           
          Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. 
          Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely 
          to restart the 
          engine.
           
          Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a 
          SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly 
          falls off with a 
          resounding CLUNK.
           
          Beat.
           
          The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's 
          side door CLATTERS to the ground.
           
          Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless 
          metal... his mind a complete blank.
           
          He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water 
          swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy 
          sweeps over 
          him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it 
          drops down... down to the river below.
           
          Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating 
          along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Hey... Hey mister!
           
          EXT. RIVER BANK
           
          Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. 
          He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and 
          HURRIES 
          as fast as he can.
           
          CAMERA DOLLIES with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a 
          black cat YOWLS as it races past him. He steps on and shatters a 
          discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans 
          against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.
           
          Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch 
          the body as it floats by.
           
          CLOSER - BODY
           
          As Stanley grabs it, the "body" falls to pieces... revealing that 
          it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits 
          of garbage all 
          clinging to the "head": an old wooden Mask.
           
          Stanley shakes his head in disgust... some lifesaver.
           
          Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic 
          symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie 
          empty eye holes.
           
          The faintest sound of a haunting "Mask SFX Theme" rises as 
          Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside... slowly 
          bringing it 
          closer and closer to his face. The surface of the Mask begins to 
          SHIMMER.
           
          But then... RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's 
          face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river 
          bottom.
           
          Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an 
          amplified voice calls out from a squad car.
           
          POLICEMAN
          Hey, you! What are you doing down
          there?
           
          Stanley squints into the light, trying to think of a reasonable 
          answer.
           
          STANLEY
          I was just looking for...
          (holds up Mask)
          My mask.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT
           
          The club is closing up. WAITERS stack chairs on top of tables in 
          the B.G. as Tina gathers her sheet music from her PIANIST.
           
          TINA
          Thanks Reno, you're the greatest.
           
          RENO
          G'night, doll.
           
          Tina crosses to the bar area where Dorian lounges with DR. 
          FREEZE, SWEET EDDY and CHUN WOO. Dorian toasts her as she pulls 
          up a bar 
          stool.
           
          DORIAN
          That was a great performance,
          baby. But not as great as the
          one you pulled off at the bank.
           
          TINA
          Yeah, well don't get used to it.
          I'm not going to start running
          cons for you again, Dorian. I'm
          a singer now and that's it.
           
          Dorian rolls his eyes at Freeze, "Get her".
           
          DORIAN
          Oh, really? And you had such a
          red hot career before you latched
          on to me?
           
          Tina pours herself a drink.
           
          TINA
          Who latched on to who?
           
          DORIAN
          Get real, Tina. You'll do what
          I say or I'll drop you back where
          I found you, slingin' hash and
          dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers.
           
          TINA
          (downs a shot)
          Don't push me, Nicky. I might
          just take a walk I should have
          taken a long time ago.
           
          DORIAN
          (CHUCKLES)
          Easy, baby. Easy.
          (to his men)
          I love it when she gets pissed.
           
          Dorian scoots over and puts an arm around Tina. She remains cool.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          C'mere. You take a hike and who's
          gonna kiss you like Dorian Tyrel.
           
          Tina pours another shot.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          C'mon. Who?
           
          Tina finally cracks a smile.
           
          TINA
          Nobody.
           
          DORIAN
          (pulls her close)
          That's right, baby. C'mere.
           
          Tina slowly leans in for a kiss, her lips softly parted... but 
          raises a finger to Dorian's lips, stopping him cold. She glances 
          over at Freeze.
           
          TINA
          Sorry. I never get personal in
          front of the help.
           
          Tina abruptly stands and exits as Freeze glares at her.
           
          Dorian breaks into laughter.
           
          DORIAN
          That broad kills me.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          She just might, man. The bitch
          is trouble.
           
          Dorian pours them all a drink.
           
          DORIAN
          C'mon Doctor, lighten up.
          (raises his glass)
          Here's to Edge City Bank.
          May it crack like an egg on Easter
          Sunday.
           
          Their glasses CLINK.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          The police car pulls up in front of Stanley's brownstone and he 
          wearily climbs out.
           
          OFFICER
          Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a
          little more careful next time.
           
          STANLEY
          Thanks Officer.
           
          The black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the 
          empty street.
           
          VOICE
          Hey, mister...
           
          Stanley turns.
           
          A razor-cut DEATH'S HEAD PUNKER hops down from a fire escape in a 
          darkened alleyway.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          You a cop or something?
           
          A half dozen other DEATH'S HEADS appear out of the shadows all 
          decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation-
          AS-FASHION 
          oddments.
           
          STANLEY
          Uh... no. They just gave me a
          lift.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          A cop chauffeur? I never seen
          that before. How about you boys?
           
          The other Death's Heads pipe up with "Not Me," "Nope," "Pretty 
          special," etc. as they slowly surround Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          Alright, you guys. It's been a
          tough night. I haven't got any
          money. I haven't got a car. All
          I have is this and you're
          welcome to it.
           
          Stanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask.
           
          He briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with 
          river slime, then tosses it back. He approaches Stanley.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          Hey, man. You got us all wrong.
          We don't want any trouble. I was
          just going to ask you for the
          time. That's all. You got the
          time?
           
          STANLEY
          Uh... yeah.
           
          As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's 
          Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he 
          slices straight 
          through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          (holding up his prize)
          See, I only wanted the time! Heh,
          he, heh...
           
          All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head 
          #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across 
          to #3 and 
          so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more 
          violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally 
          breaks free and 
          scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He 
          fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's 
          Heads roar with 
          laughter.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          Stanley's wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past -
           
          APARTMENT "A" - MANAGER
           
          A sign that reads "Quiet Please" hangs from the doorknob. Stanley 
          continues past it to Apartment "B". Just as he removes his keys - 
          THE 
          Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old 
          dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to 
          spite her 
          relatives.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what
          time it is?
           
          Reflexively, he looks at his (now empty) wrist.
           
          STANLEY
          Actually, no.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          It's three o'clock in the morning!
          First, you wake up the entire
          building laughing it up with your
          pals. Then, you come in and start
          squeak -
          (sees puddles)
          My new carpet! Just look at that!
          This is coming out of your
          cleaning deposit Ipkiss!
           
          Stanley, battered, bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban 
          shell-shock.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTLY)
          Are you done?
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          ...Yes.
           
          STANLEY
          I think I'll be going to bed now.
           
          Mrs. Peenman SLAMS her door.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUES
           
          Small, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation 
          cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks 
          the door behind 
          him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized mutt with 
          a big heart.
           
          STANLEY
          Hello, Milo.
           
          Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Easy, buddy. I missed you too.
           
          Stanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and 
          heads straight into...
           
          THE BEDROOM
           
          Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes 
          are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf.
           
          He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his 
          cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his 
          bed and 
          starts to strip off his shoes and socks.
           
          MILO
           
          enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          C'mon, Milo. I'm beat.
          (to the dog YIPS)
          Okay, okay. One throw.
           
          Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails...
           
          OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY
           
          Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots 
          back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap.
           
          STANLEY
          Easy. This is the best part.
           
          On the screen a cartoon dog ZZZIPS into frame and drops a 
          frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants. KA-BOOM! The 
          dog LAUGHS 
          maniacally.
           
          Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles Stanley's 
          framed cartoon cels.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (calls out)
          Sorry Mrs. Peenman.
           
          With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show POPS 
          on. Larry King and a guest.
           
          Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up.
           
          ANGLE ON T.V.
           
          King's guest, Dr. Arthur Neuman, is replying to a caller.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          That's correct. The truth is we
          all wear masks, metaphorically
          speaking. We repress the Id...
          our darkest desires and hide
          behind a more socially acceptable
          image of ourselves in order to
          cope with the frustrations of our
          day to day lives.
           
          Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as he 
          brushes his teeth.
           
          STANLEY
          Think I'm repressed, Milo?
           
          Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom 
          mirror, his mouth foaming with toothpaste.
           
          Milo does that doggie-head-cocked-sideways "What the hell?" look.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
          Nah.
           
          He spits and rinses.
           
          ANGLE ON T.V.
           
          as King wraps it up, displaying the doctor's book.
           
          LARRY KING
          The book is "The Masks We Wear,"
          by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you
          Dr. Neuman.
           
          Stanley pops off the T.V.with his remote.
           
          STANLEY
          No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
           
          As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing 
          at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. A 
          SUBTLE 
          SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off 
          the bed.
           
          We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"... echoes of the POUNDING 
          Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to 
          call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up 
          the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers 
          across the time 
          work wood. The music builds...
           
          He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask 
          to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.
           
          For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over 
          Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.
           
          Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Whoa.
           
          Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror. 
          Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Naw...
           
          He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under 
          the bed as...
           
          AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:
           
          RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around 
          Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place.
           
          STANLEY'S PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves... growing in all 
          directions.
           
          HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS, turning lime green as it unites with 
          the Mask.
           
          STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.
           
          Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier 
          and loonier as he becomes...
           
          A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his 
          voice jumps one, two, five octaves.
           
          STANLEY
          Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...
           
          A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The 
          whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise 
          FROM 
          the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing...
           
          THE MASK CREATURE
           
          He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley 
          material of Stanley's pajamas.
           
          The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright 
          green. The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small, 
          bony and beaked. 
          The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks 
          into a learning grin.
           
          The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether 
          unhuman. In fact, there's something downright charming about him.
           
          The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.
           
          THE MASK
          S-s-s-nazzy!
           
          He SNAPS his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          It's party time!
           
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
           
          Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the 
          darkened corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as 
          the Mask steps 
          with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT "A" with it's little "Quiet 
          Please" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the "SHUSH" 
          sign.
           
          Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of 
          Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          O, jeepers--!
           
          Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every 
          time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his 
          pocket and 
          starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. 
          Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but 
          those bells just keep 
          ringing.
           
          The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers 
          into the floor and reverberates through the building like 
          THUNDERBOLTS.
           
          The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out 
          covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look 
          at the Mask 
          with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and 
          SCREAMS bloody murder.
           
          The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and 
          his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.
           
          Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she 
          appears cocking an enormous shotgun.
           
          MASK
          Easy lady! I was just killin'
          time!
           
          The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal 
          laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.
           
          The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast 
          away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.
           
          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
           
          Sending his body SAILING our through the air towards the street 
          seven stories below.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
           
          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
           
          SPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. He 
          slow... painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING machine 
          turns a 
          corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down 
          the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.
           
          He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself 
          off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and 
          straightens his 
          zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Hey! You missed a spot!
           
          As if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and 
          RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3-
          D 
          by blowing into his thumb and hops up.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          And next time, no starch!
           
          Fully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting 
          like a prize fighter.
           
          VOICE
          Hey mister...
           
          Death's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the 
          Mask.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #1
          (grins evilly)
          ...You got the time?
           
          The Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head 
          punkers. He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that 
          they see his 
          face, they're totally freaked.
           
          MASK
          (wiggles eyebrows)
          Why of course, Cubbie. I got all
          the time in the world!
           
          He whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon-
          style). It's covered with crazily spinning watches, CHIMING 
          cuckoo clocks 
          and sun dials.
           
          MASK
          London, Paris, Rome, standard,
          substandard and no standards at
          all! And for our English friends
          we have... Big Ben!
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #1
          Big Ben?
           
           
          Stanley/Mask KICKS a nearby street post, snapping it in half and 
          sending a large decorative street clock PLUMMETING into the 
          sidewalk. 
          KA-BONG! It completely obliterates Death's Head #1. The other 
          gang members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the 
          corner.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #2
          Get him!
           
          The Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around 
          the corner into the alleyway.
           
          INT. ALLEY
           
          They come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask 
          dressed as a carnival barker. Multicolored lights and Calliope 
          music come from 
          out of nowhere.
           
          MASK
          And for my next trick...
           
          Long pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and he 
          instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into 
          AN 
          elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH.
           
          The Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all 
          this to do anything but stand there and stare. (These guys were 
          no rocket 
          scientists in the first place.)
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          And viola! We have a giraffe!
           
          Sure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture. He 
          hands it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a 
          little kid upon 
          receiving it.
           
          The Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting 
          more balloons. SCREECH POP.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A few more twists of the wrist
          and for you, Cubbie.
           
          He hands this next prize to Death's Head #3.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A French poodle! And finally my
          favorite...
           
          He goes into another flurry of motion.
           
          E.C.U. - BALLOON
           
          As the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens 
          out and MORPHS into...
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A Tommy gun!
           
          A real one! He immediately sprays the Death's Heads with hot 
          lead. RATATATATATAT!
           
          The greasy punkers dive for cover and scramble out of the alley 
          under a hail of bullets.
           
          Stanley/Mask tosses the gun aside, intoxicated with his newfound 
          powers.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Wait a minute. This is
          incredible! Why, with these
          powers I could be a superhero!
          I could fight crime... Work for
          world peace...
           
          C.U. - THE MASK
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          But first!...
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - NIGHT
           
          It's late, but there's still a light on inside.
           
          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
           
          Burt and Irv, both woozy from drink, attempt to finish a card 
          game. A dozen empty beer bottles and two half eaten chili dogs 
          adorn the table.
           
          Irv takes a big bite of his chili dog and pauses to regard it 
          like a true connoisseur.
           
          IRV
          Now these are serious chili dogs.
           
          BURT
          I know. Here's the proof...
          (lets out a long BUUURP)
          Aaah. Even tastier the second
          time around.
           
          Irv leans forward and sticks out his index finger.
           
          IRV
          Hey Burt, pull on my finger.
           
          BURT
          No way, man.
           
          IRV
          No, really. Go ahead.
           
          BURT
          Irv, don't...
           
          Irv raises a leg anyway and rips off a nasty fart. BRAAAP!
           
          IRV
          (PROUDLY)
          That, my friend is the sweet smell
          of success.
           
          BURT
          (SHRUGS)
          No style. I give it a five tops.
           
          IRV
          Okay, how about... Soprano.
           
          Irv shifts his weight and hits an amazing high note. PWEEEEEP! 
          Burt is impressed in spite of himself.
           
          BURT
          Fine muscle control.
           
          IRV
          And now for my grand finale,
          THX... The audience is listening!
           
          Irv lets one loose in perfect sensurround.
           
          Suddenly the front door EXPLODES inward. Stanley/Mask stands 
          there SILHOUETTED like a gunfighter from a Clint Eastwood movie.
           
          Irv squints into the light, unable to make out the mysterious 
          figure.
           
          IRV
          Hey, 40 watt... we're closed!
          Nobody's here.
           
          MASK
          Ah... but you're here.
           
          Irv rises.
           
          IRV
          What I mean is...
           
          He lets loose a sneaker to help make his point. POOOOT.
           
          IRV
          Nobody's here that wants to
          help you.
           
          Stanley/Mask now steps into the light.
           
          MASK
          But I'm here to help you.
           
          Burt and Irv's eyes go wide as they get a better look at their 
          nemesis. Fear loosens Irv's sphincter and a last feeble bit of 
          gas escapes with a 
          FWEEP!
           
          Stanley/Mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming 
          mufflers from the wall.
           
          MASK
          Sounds like you have a little
          exhaust problem there!
           
          There's a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers like two 
          huge pistols and SNAPS them to a halt.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          We better do a few touch ups
          before you have some serious
          trouble.
           
          The Mask TWIRLS out of frame like a human tornado.
           
          Camera PUSHES IN past Burt and Irv's shocked expressions into an 
          E.C.U. of the garage's bare light bulb as it JIGGLES on its wire. 
          We can't see the mayhem, but we can hear wacky/bizarre sound F.X. 
          as the Mask whirls about the garage. WHIZ! SCREECH! BANG! AHOOGA!
           
          BURT AND IRV
          No!... Wait! Eeeeeyaah!
           
          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
           
          As that light bulb becomes the morning SUN peaking over Edge 
          City's skyline. CAMERA PULLS BACK through Stanley's bedroom 
          window...
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
           
          Stanley slowly awakens. He grabs his head and moans, looking and 
          feeling completely hung over. Then suddenly he remembers - and 
          JUMPS 
          out of bed with a start.
           
          He looks in the mirror, touching his face. It's the same old 
          Stanley. He looks at his paisley PJ's. Same old PJ's.
           
          He picks up the mask. Same old mask.
           
          STANLEY
          A dream... It was only a dream.
           
          Stanley starts to relax. There's a KNOCK at the door.
           
          INT. HALLWAY - DAWN
           
          Stanley's greeted by LT. KELLAWAY (50). This hound-dog of a cop 
          can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Nice PJ's pal.
           
          STANLEY
          Can I help you?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          STANLEY
          That's right.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Some kind of prowler broke in and
          attacked Mrs. Peenman.
           
          STANLEY
          (swallows hard)
          Really? I didn't hear a thing.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Then you must be a pretty sound
          sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she
          unloaded a couple rounds of 20
          ott buckshot five feet from your
          door.
           
          Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better 
          view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall 
          tearfully speaking to 
          anither OFFICER.
           
          Stanley is flabbergasted to see:
           
          QUICK CUTS
           
          C.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls.
           
          C.U. - The pot holes left from the mallet.
           
          C.U. - The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock.
           
          All flashbacks from last night!
           
          STANLEY
          (GASPS)
          That's... impossible!
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Excuse me?
           
          Stanley quickly pulls himself together.
           
          STANLEY
          That's... a, possible. See, I
          have this inner ear problem.
          (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously)
          Sometimes I can't hear a thing.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SKEPTICAL)
          Is that a fact?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself 
          and shoots Stanley a dirty look.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Forget it.
           
          He hands Stanley his card.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Here. You remember anything
          unusual about last night, anything
          at all, call me.
           
          STANLEY
          Sure... thanks.
           
          Stanley SLAMS the door and throws his body against it, his heart 
          pounding in his chest. Milo gives him that curious 
          dog-head-cocked-sideways look.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Milo, it was real! How could it
          all be... real?
           
          Stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Oh my god. I'm late!
           
          He races into the bedroom.
           
          INT. HALLWAY
           
          Kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs. 
          Peenman.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta
          admit your description is pretty
          tough to swallow.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Then you can choke on it for all
          I care. I saw what I saw.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Right.
          (refers to notes)
          A green head the size of a
          pumpkin, purple zoot suit and
          spats. That's a pretty serious
          fashion risk for any
          self-respecting second story man.
           
          An OFFICER now hurries up the steps all out of breath.
           
          OFFICER
          Lt., we just got an emergency call
          from a mechanic on 67th Street.
           
          KELLAWAY
          What?
           
          POLICEMAN
          Some kind of assault and battery.
          Sound pretty bad.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SIGHS)
          Alright. Dont' worry Mrs.
          Peenman, we'll find this guy for
          you. Officer Deluca here has a
          few forms you'll have to fill out.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT
           
          Stanley rushes around the apartment, but he can't find his keys 
          anywhere. He finishes tying his tie as he searches.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo! Keys! Keys!
           
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
           
          Milo's ears prick. He leaps up and immediately starts sniffing 
          around. He pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys 
          just as Stanley 
          comes out, briefcaase in hand.
           
          STANLEY
          Good boy.
           
          He pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door... but he 
          pauses to take a last look at the mask... It's eerie black eye 
          holes and devilish 
          grin seem to mock him.
           
          On sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's 
          sliding glass door and exits.
           
          SLOW-MO - THE MASK
           
          Sailing end over end through the air.
           
          EXT. BUILDING
           
          As the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up.
           
          The mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands 
          balanced precariously on a narrow ledge. Its mocking grin seems 
          to glow 
          with triumph.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - DAY
           
          The place looks like it's been hit by cartoon graffiti 
          guerrillas: Everything's printed in polka-dots, checks, tartan, 
          etc. The 
          "Ripley Auto Finishing" sign hangs askew over the doorway. 
          Letters have been sprayed out to read "Rip Off!"
           
          Several REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as Kellaway 
          and his men take it all in. PARAMEDICS appear wheeling Burt and 
          Irv out of the building on two gurneys.
           
          They're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than 
          men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued 
          to their 
          foreheads, wire rims under each limb, and gleaming four foot long 
          mufflers sticking out of their rear ends.
           
          They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney.
           
          BURT AND IRV
          Ah!... Eeeh!... Ooh!
           
          Paramedic #3 speaks into his emergency radio-phone as Burt and 
          Irv are loaded into the van.
           
          PARAMEDIC #3
          I want a proctologist standing
          by! Yeah, you heard me! The best
          one you can find.
           
          An OFFICER steps out of the building and approaches Kellaway.
           
          OFFICER
          We were able to get a description
          Lt., but it's pretty weird.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SIGHS)
          Let me guess... Big green head.
          Zoot suit.
           
          OFFICER
          How did you...
           
          KELLWAY
          Whoever this guy is, he's a world
          class twisto.
           
          PEGGY BRANDT, an attractive young woman in her mid twenties, 
          appears besides the other reporters and approaches Kellaway, 
          notepad in 
          hand.
           
          PEGGY
          Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the
          Evening Star. Can you tell me
          what happened here?
           
          KELLAWAY
          Sorry. Too early to comment.
           
          PEGGY
          It looks like some kind of mob
          scare tactic.
           
          KELLAWAY
          I said no comment. Now break it
          up. This is a crime scene.
           
          As the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers, Peggy 
          slips away from the group. Even though it's closed off with 
          yellow police 
          tape, Peggy slips inside the garage.
           
          INT. MECHANIC'S OFFICE - DAY
           
          The empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare. 
          The same cartoon paint job covers the walls. Peggy looks around, 
          SIFTING 
          through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.
           
          Then she spies the COMPLAINT BOX. Peggy opens it and pulls out a 
          HANDFUL of pink "comment" slips. She looks at them. Almost all of 
          them are from one customer - STANLEY IPKISS.
           
          INT. BANK - DAY
           
          Stanley, still looking rumpled and unshaven, hurriedly takes off 
          his coat and powers up his computer. Charlie steps over to his 
          desk carrying a 
          newspaper.
           
          CHARLIE
          What happened to you last night?
          The girls and I were looking all
          over for you.
           
          STANLEY
          I uh, didn't feel so good. I
          decided to go home early.
           
          CHARLIE
          As a matter of fact, you don't
          look so good. You got to take
          better care of yourself, man.
           
          STANLEY
          How was the club?
           
          CHARLIE
          Are you kidding? It was hotter
          than a pistol. Did you see the
          paper?
           
          STANLEY
          No.
           
          CHARLIE
          Your girlfriend got a great
          review.
           
          Chralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star. 
          There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the 
          HEADLINE 
          "Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw."
           
          MR. DICKEY, the smarmy office manager who is younger than 
          Stanley, now appears.
           
          DICKEY
          Ipkiss! You're forty minutes
          late! Every time you do that
          you're robbing this bank of its
          time and money!
           
          STANLEY
          Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't
          happen again.
           
          DICKEY
          (snatches newspaper)
          If you weren't so busy ogling
          girlie pictures you'd get some
          work done around here.
           
          CHARLIE
          Ah... She's a prospective client
          of Stanley's, sir.
           
          DICKEY
          (sudden attitude change)
          She is? Well... Next time she
          comes in see that you send her
          directly to my office.
           
          STANLEY
          Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.
           
          Dickey tosses the paper back on Stanley's desk and marches off 
          through the bank.
           
          CHARLIE
          Look at that little creep. If
          it wasn't for his daddy he'd be
          out somewhere shakin' down school
          kids for lunch money.
           
          Stanley toys with the Kleenex that bears Tina's lipstick "kiss".
           
          STANLEY
          You think she ever will come back,
          Charlie?
           
          CHARLIE
          Who knows? Forget about her,
          Stanley. A dame like that is
          always looking for the B.B.D.
          The bigger better deal. Ask her
          what her sign is and she'll say
          dollar.
           
          STANLEY
          You don't know that. She's an
          artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
           
          CHARLIE
          Yeah. She can sense a guy's
          credit line at two hundred yards.
          Stanley, you need a girl you can
          depend on. Someone a little more
          down to earth... someone like...
           
          ANGLE ACROSS THE BANK
           
          as Peggy Brandt stops by a teller's window, looking sharp and 
          pretty in a blazer and jeans.
           
          PEGGY
          Excuse me, can you tell me where
          I can find Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          BACK TO CHARLIE
           
          CHARLIE
          Like her! Someone like her.
          (straightens tie)
          As a matter of fact I could use
          someone like her myself.
          (rises as Peggy approaches)
          Hel-lo there. May I be of some
          assistance?
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          Charlie begrudgingly points to Stanley.
           
          PEGGY (CONT.)
          Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with
          the Evening Star.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, hi. I already have a
          subscription, thanks.
           
          PEGGY
          Oh no, actually I just wanted to
          ask you a few questions.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? About what?
           
          PEGGY
          Ripley Auto Finishing. You're
          a customer of theirs aren't you?
           
          STANLEY
          I... uh. No. I think you must
          have made a mistake.
           
          Peggy produces one of the complaint slips.
           
          PEGGY
          Isn't this a form of theirs you
          filled out?
           
          STANLEY
          (nervous chuckle)
          Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess
          I have stopped in there once or
          twice, Miss... what did you say
          your name was?
           
          PEGGY
          Peggy Brandt.
           
          STANLEY
          Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of
          "Ask Peggy"?
           
          PEGGY
          That's right.
           
          STANLEY
          (brightens up)
          You printed my letter last year,
          remember? "Nice Guys Finish
          Last."
           
          PEGGY
          You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do
          you realize how much mail we got
          about that letter? There's
          hundreds of women out there who
          are looking for a man just like
          you.
           
          STANLEY
          Are you serious?
           
          PEGGY
          Of course. DO you know how hard
          it is to find a decent man in this
          town? Most of them think monogamy
          is some kind of wood.
           
          STANLEY
          Why are you covering this story?
           
          PEGGY
          They cut my salary. I just can't
          make it by on "Dear Peggy"
          anymore. The truth is, I want
          to be a real reporter and if I
          can break this story I know
          they'll let me.
          (sits closer)
          Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto
          is a crooked operation. They may
          even have had ties to the Mob.
          I'm not out to get you. I just
          want the truth.
           
          STANLEY
          I wish I knew the truth, Peggy.
          I really do.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. MONKEY'S PAW ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON
           
          A well dressed MAN checks from beneath his sunglasses to see 
          nobody's watching and RAPS on the door. It opens and he quickly 
          DISAPPEARS 
          inside.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          Sweet Eddy escorts him inside. The man removes his glasses and 
          glances about nervously. Dorian sits at his desk. Dr. Freeze and 
          Chun Woo 
          are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out 
          on the air hockey table.
           
          DORIAN
          Good afternoon, Councilman Snell.
          Nice of you to drop by.
           
          SNELL
          Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so
          important that I had to come here
          in person?
           
          Dorian gazes out the window to the Valhalla Casino.
           
          DORIAN
          I got a little job for you, Tom.
          I want you to pull the Swede's
          gambling license.
           
          SNELL
          That's impossible. He was
          approved six months ago.
           
          DORIAN
          Pull a few strings. Find
          something in the fine print. I
          don't care how you do it, but do
          it. You owe me.
           
          SNELL
          (CHUCKLES)
          I owe you nothing, you little
          piece of shit. I got your
          liquor license when nobody else
          would touch...
           
          Dorian suddenly EXPLODES, overturning his desk and sending Snell 
          tumbling backwards. In less than a heartbeat, he grabs Snell by 
          his shirt 
          ffront, SLAMS him up against the wall, SMASHES a whiskey bottle 
          and presses the jagged edge to his throat.
           
          Snell hangs there whimpering. Dorian has a crazed look in his 
          eyes as he gazes at the Councilman's lapel.
           
          DORIAN
          (SOFTLY)
          That's pretty. What is that, a
          carnation?
           
          Snell nods. Dorian takes a deep whiff.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Nice. Hey, Eddy... call my
          florist. Two dozen pink
          carnations to Mrs. Snell with my
          regrets over her husband's
          untimely accident.
           
          Tears begin to well up in Snell's eyes.
           
          SNELL
          (GASPING)
          No... please. I can do it. I
          can make it happen.
           
          Dorian eases back... brushes off Snell's coat.
           
          DORIAN
          That's smart. You're a very smart
          man. Now pull yourself together.
          Look at you.
           
          Dorian picks up an Uzi from Dr. Freeze's equipment.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Shut the Swede down, Snell. We'll
          buy him out cheap with a little
          collateral the bank is about to
          provide us.
          (looks at his men)
          And Gentlemen... we are going to
          be in the casino business.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. STANLEY'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
           
          Distant sirens can be heard over the occasional sound of a 
          gunshot. It's a reasonably peaceful night in Edge City.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
           
          CAMERA SLOWLY PANS off of Tina's picture, which is now taped to 
          Stanley's dresser mirror... to Stanley himself as he tosses and 
          turns in a 
          fitful sleep. Milo lies curled up at the foot of the bed. He 
          looks concerned over the little noises Stanley is making in his 
          sleep.
           
          CAMERA PUSHES INTO AN E.C.U. of Stanley as we
           
          DISSOLVE THROUGH INTO:
           
          STANLEY'S DREAM - a 1940s noir-style montage:
           
          Huge soft-lit faces loom over him, one dissolving into the 
          next... Tina, luminous and breathtaking speaks under heavily 
          lidded eyes.
           
          TINA
          Or it could be two lovers.
          That would be the woman on top,
          of course...
           
          Charlie looms up out of the darkness.
           
          CHARLIE
          Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what
          her sign is and she'll say dollar.
           
          Mr. Dickey appears, glaring down angrily at Stanley.
           
          DICKEY
          Every time you're late Ipkiss,
          you're robbing this bank!
           
          The shrink from the "larry King Show" floats by on a cloud of 
          pipe smoke.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          We must repress our Id... our
          deepest darkest desires.
           
          Finally Tina again standing beside the limo as she was that night 
          in the Monkey's Paw alley:
           
          TINA
          Hey, are you okay.
           
          Stanley stands at the curb, but this time he's not splattered 
          with mud. He's decked out in first class Armani and looks suave 
          as hell. He looks 
          straight into her eyes.
           
          STANLEY
          I am now. C'mere, baby.
           
          TINA
          (SWOONS)
          Oh, Stanley!
           
          She runs to his arms and they embrace in a passionate kiss. But 
          Tina suddenly pulls back and begins rapidly licking Stanley's 
          ear... which is 
          kinda weird.
           
          E.C.U. - STANLEY
           
          STANLEY
          Tina?
           
          Stanley suddenly realizes Milo is licking his ear... and he's 
          just woken up.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Milo, down.
           
          He pushes Milo away, tosses back the covers and rises out of bed. 
          It's still the dead of night and Stanley is all in a huff from 
          his dream.
           
          He spots Tina's clipping on his dresser mirror and rips it off, 
          upset with himself.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Stupid, stupid. She'd never...
           
          Stanley wheels about and to his complete surprise sees...
           
          THE MASK
           
          Through his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge. 
          Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the 
          POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme.
           
          STANLEY
           
          stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost 
          hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly 
          siren song above 
          the pounding drums.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTLY)
          No...
           
          He backs away from the window.
           
          E.C.U. - THE MASK
           
          shimmers as the WHISPERS grow louder.
           
          STANLEY
           
          takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and 
          finally loses control. He bolts from the room.
           
          EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
           
          Stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow 
          ledge. Milo tugs at his pajama leg, but Stanley kicks him away 
          and climbs out 
          over the ledge.
           
          THE LEDGE
           
          Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then 
          catches his balance. His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at 
          the leering face. 
          F.X. music THUNDERS in his head.
           
          THE MASK
          (faint echos)
          Stanley... Stanley.
           
          Stanley tries to steady himself, his eyes transfixed on his 
          prize.
           
          STANLEY
          Just... one... last... time.
           
          He lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time 
          towards the mask.
           
          MILO
           
          watches from the apratment window, whimpering softly.
           
          C.U. - THE LEDGE
           
          Narrow masonry begins to crumble.
           
          STANLEY
           
          carefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he 
          teeters out over nothingness. Night traffic whizzes by down 
          below.
           
          THE MASONRY
           
          cracks away.
           
          STANLEY
           
          SCREAMS as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face.
           
          INT. APARTMENT
           
          The window suddenly EXPLODES inwards as the whirling Stanley/Mask 
          tornado bursts into the room. Milo dives for cover.
           
          The tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room, then 
          SCREECHES to a halt, revealing the Mask in his full glory. He 
          strikes a grand 
          entrance pose with his arms held high.
           
          MASK
          (SINGS)
          I gotta be me! I just gotta be me!
           
          He ZZZIPS into the bathroom
           
          INT. BATHROOM
           
          The Mask sticks the picture of Tina on the bathroom mirror and 
          blows her a kiss.
           
          MASK
          (a'la Big Bopper)
          Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what
          you likah!
           
          He sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth, 
          sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at 
          once.
           
          He ZZZIPS into the bedroom.
           
          INT. BEDROOM
           
          The Mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself 
          out. With a magical "hands are quicker than the eye" move, he 
          CHANGES 
          wardrobe instantly... now posing in an effete fashion victim Don 
          Johnson-style suit.
           
          MASK
          The G.Q. look?... Naw.
           
          In a TWINKLING he's changed again: now in MTV Rapper-style over-
          sized jeans and backwards baseball cap.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          501's?
          (shakes his head)
          For buttonheads only.
           
          He changes again in a flash... This time he's naked except for 
          his Calvin Klein underwear (his stomach muscles appear super-cut 
          washboard-style).
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Marky Mark, eat your heart out.
           
          He changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot 
          suit complete with a snap brim fedora. That's the ticket!
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          S-s-s-mokin! Now let's see...
           
          The Mask quickly searches his pockets. He pulls his pants pockets 
          inside out and a moth flutters out.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          What? Seems to be a minor cash
          flow problem here! I don't like
          to keep a lady waiting, but...
          (points a finger in the air)
          First things first!
           
          The Mask ZZZIPS out of frame.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT EDGE CITY BANK - NIGHT
           
          The street is quiet and empty, except for a Dipsy Doodle Diaper 
          delivery van parked across from the bank.
           
          INT. TRUCK
           
          Crowded with Dorian's men, it's been set up as a makeshift 
          control room for the robbery. Dr. Freeze SLAPS a clip in his 9mm 
          and looks down 
          through the van's false bottom to Sweet Eddy, who is standing in 
          an open manhole working on a bundle of underground wiring.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          What's the E.T.A.?
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Another five minutes.
           
          Freeze synchronizes his watch.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Counting down... now.
           
          Freeze presses a button on the side of a miniaturized headset 
          he's wearing

          INTERCUT - DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          He sits at his desk, speaking into a high tech walkie talkie. In 
          the B.G. Dorian's wall-mounted video monitors display live shots 
          of the club in full 
          swing.
           
          DORIAN
          Nice work, Freeze. You boy are
          on your own now. I've got to make
          sure I'm seen downstairs.
           
          DR. FREEZE (V.O.)
          Do it, man. The Doctah is about
          to operate.
           
          INT. VAN
           
          Freeze turns to his men.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Gentlemen...
          (cocks his gun)
          Let's do our duty and grab the
          booty.
           
          The burglars gather their gear when suddenly the bank alarm 
          starts RINGING.
           
          Freeze looks down the hole to Sweet Eddy.
           
          DR. FREEZE (CONT.)
          What the hell you doin', fool?
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Nothing! I didn't do nothing!
           
          FREEZE
          (to the others)
          C'mon! You keep that motor
          runnin'!
           
          EXT. BANK
           
          Freeze and company race across the street with guns drawn.
           
          ANGLE ON THE BANK DOORS
           
          Freeze and Chun Woo flatten themselves on either side of the door 
          as Burglar #4 drops to one knee and quickly picks the lock.
           
          Suddenly the glass doors EXPLODE wide open as a HUMAN WHIRLWIND 
          bursts out of the bank, shoots right past them and zig-zags up 
          THE 
          street. Twenty dollar bills slowly drift down onto the stunned 
          robbers in its wake.
           
          In an instant the whirlwind does a U-turn, zig-zag races back up 
          to them and SCREECHES to a halt. The Mask, still in his banana 
          yellow zoot suit 
          and carrying huge sacks of money like Santa Claus, plucks those 
          stray twenties from the air, one, two, three.
           
          MASK
          Sorry, fellas. Waste not want
          not!
           
          And ZZZOOM, he's off again. HOOTING laughter like a maniac.
           
          Freeze pulls his gun.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Get that sucker!
           
          Two cop cars now SQUEAL around the corner, their sirens blaring 
          and ROAR up the street at the bank robbers.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Oh, shit!
           
          The robbers race back to the van, dive inside and PEEL OUT. The 
          police open fire as they roar after them in hot pursuit. Bullets 
          tear into the 
          van, blowing out the rear windows.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. MONKEY'S PAW
           
          The die-hard crowd of TRENDIES is piled up outside as usual 
          clamoring to get in. But a buzz of excitement begins to travel 
          through the crowd 
          as one by one they notice...
           
          A LIMOUSINE
           
          But not just any limousine. As it slowly pulls up by the front of 
          the club we realized it's long... longer... the longest limousine 
          we'vve ever seen. 
          Finally the passenger door rolls into sight and the limo comes to 
          a halt.
           
          The door bursts open and out leaps the Mask.
           
          THE MASK
          Ah... my public!
           
          The crowd parts like the Red Sea as the Mask sashays to the front 
          door. Bobby the Bouncer gets one look at the Mask and actually 
          loses his 
          cool.
           
          BOBBY
          Er, uh... Are you on the list?
           
          THE MASK
          No, but I believe my friends are.
          (fans a wad of cash)
          Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.
           
          He tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club 
          as the crowd scrambles for the cash.
           
          INT. MONKEY'S PAW
           
          This is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and 
          it's a real eyeful. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO REVEAL its wild tropical 
          DECOR 
          complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. 
          WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the 
          crowded dance 
          floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks.
           
          CAMERA ENDFRAMES as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite 
          ringside table and removes the "reserved" sign. The lights dim an 
          all eyes 
          go to the bandstand.
           
          ANGLE OF THE BANDSTAND
           
          A spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a 
          gigantic fan revealing...
           
          TINA CARLYLE
           
          in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and 
          mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress 
          would be arrested 
          for disturbing the peace.
           
          She talks/sings the intro of her number a capella.
           
          TINA
          There's all kinds of men
          In this old world
          That seek the affections
          Of a beautiful girl.
           
          But of the men from
          Which to choose
          There's only one type
          That I... ap...aprooove.
           
          And now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina 
          sings "Checks Appeal". She works the room throughout the song, 
          driving the 
          men crazy as she lingers by each table.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          You can keep your cowboys
          on the farm
          The gigolos don't make me warm
          It's mink my fingers
          crave to feel
          I need a man with checks appeal.
           
          ANOTHER ANGLE
           
          The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and 
          immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina.
           
          His eyes BUG OUT on stalks, an AHOOGA horn sounds and his heart 
          starts POUNDING wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with 
          EACH 
          beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          Pretty boys are such a bore
          There's manly macho types galore
          But you'll always know
          The diamond's real
          If you've got a man with checks appeal.
           
          The Mask snatches a bottle off a passing WAITRESS' tray and sucks 
          it down in one gulp. His head VIBRATES like an electric paint 
          shaker. 
          WWWOOOING! He CLAPS both hands on his head to hold it still.
           
          DORIAN'S TABLE
           
          Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          What the hell are you doing here?
           
          EDDY
          We got trouble. You better come
          upstairs.
           
          Dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards 
          his office.
           
          ANGLE ON THE MASK
           
          as he continues to ogle Tina. His face now elongates into a 
          wolf's. He HOWLS, WHISTLES, pounds his fist on the table and 
          stomps his foot on 
          the floor.
           
          TINA
          Don't want to see too fanatic
          But dollar signs are so romantic
          I want a love
          That's deep and real
          Just with a man that's got...
          (big finish)
          Checks ap-peaaal.
           
          The audience goes crazy. Tina takes a bow.
           
          Suddenly the Mask ZZZIPS around the perimiter of the club, leaps 
          up on top of the piano and SNAPS his fingers. A spotlight hits 
          him.
           
          THE MASK
          Let's rock this joint!
           
          He grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed PIANIST'S stool and spins it hard. 
          When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, 
          BEATNIK 
          BE-BOPPER who immediately starts pounding out a mean BOOGIE-
          WOOGIE.
           
          The Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around 
          and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, WAILING 
          out a 
          driving rock 'n roll tune.
           
          Satisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance 
          floor, grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into 
          a wild special 
          FX JITTERBUG.
           
          THE CROWD
           
          watches amazed as...
           
          THE MASK AND TINA
           
          put Fred and Ginger to shame. Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask 
          movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov. He SHOOTS 
          TINA 
          beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a 
          baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat.
           
          THE MASK
          S-s-s-smokin!
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, 
          gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound 
          in his side.
           
          DORIAN
          What the hell happened to you?
           
          FREEZE
          I'll be okay. Nobody puts the
          chill on Freeze.
           
          DORIAN
          Where's the money?
           
          FREEZE
          Deal went south, Bro'. Someone
          else hit the place before we did.
           
          DORIAN
          Who?
           
          FREEZE
          Don't know. Dude looked like
          a freakin' goblin or something.
          Next thing we know there's cops
          all over us, man.
           
          DORIAN
          Where's Chun Woo?
           
          FREEZE
          Takin' a dirt nap. It was bad,
          man. Real bad.
          (swallows hard)
          I need a smoke.
           
          DORIAN
          Yeah... sure.
           
          Dorian taps out a cigarette, places it between Dr. Freeze's lips 
          and lights it... but the flame doesn't draw.
           
          Beat.
           
          The cigarette tumbles from Freeze's mouth.
           
          Dorian glances back up and sees that Dr. Freeze's eyes are glazed 
          over in death.
           
          Dorian leaps to his feat and hurls his chair across the room in 
          anger. It SMASHES the mirror over his bar.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Son of a bitch! Who did this
          Eddy? Who?
           
          Eddy is staring at Dorian's T.V. monitor. On it the Mask can 
          still be seen in the midst of his wild dance with Tina.
           
          EDDY
          That's him... That's the guy!
           
          Dorian grabs a .45 from his desk, checks the barrel and jams it 
          in his coat.
           
          DORIAN
          Come on!
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. DANCE FLOOR
           
          The Mask spins Tina all around him like a top and then SHOOTS her 
          straight up into the air.
           
          Amazingly, she continues somersaulting at the apex of her ascent, 
          suspended in mid-air by her magical momentum.
           
          THE MASK
           
          stands there nonchalantly filing his nails, whistling to himself.
           
          Tina continues to SPIN in place high above him.
           
          THE MASK
           
          casually checks his watch. Without looking up he holds out one 
          hand for the catch.
           
          TINA
           
          perfect timing... A final somesault and she drops right back down 
          into his arms. They go straight back into a rockin' hitterbug 
          without missing a 
          beat.
           
          THE WINDING STAIRCASE
           
          Dorian and Eddy race down the steps, guns drawn. Dorian calls to 
          Bobby by the hostess' stand.
           
          DORIAN
          Clear the club. Now!
           
          DANCE FLOOR
           
          The dance's grand finale. The Mask spins Tina around and around 
          his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances.
           
          As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask 
          SCREECHES Tina to a halt, bends her over backwards and nails her 
          with a Valentino 
          kiss that literally blows her shoes off; SSSMACK! KAPOW!
           
          She hangs onto the Mask's tie for support when BANG the tie is 
          shot in half. Tina falls on her cute behind.
           
          C.U. - TIE
           
          The shot-away piece of the Mask's tie flutters to the floor and 
          MORPHS back into a piece of Stanley's pajamas.
           
          DORIAN
           
          stands at the edge of the dance floor, his smoking gun trained on 
          the Mask.
           
          THE MASK
          (gasps in mock horror)
          Gee willickers! Does this mean
          we won't make the Star Search
          finals?
           
          DORIAN
          This means you won't make it out
          of this club alive if you don't
          tell me where my money is.
           
          THE MASK
          Okay...
           
          The Mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle 
          calculator, snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating. KA-
          CHING.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          (fast talking)
          You got a 27.5% in T-Bills
          amortized over the fiscal yeah
          16-3/4% in stocks and bonds/
          (KA-CHING, KA-CHING)
          Carry the nine and divide by the
          Gross National Product...
           
          DORIAN
          Now cut that out!
          (turns to Eddy)
          Ventilate this goon!
           
          Eddy pulls out his .38 and starts blasting BLAM. BLAM.
           
          The Mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon-flexible 
          body.
           
          BLAM. The Mask SPINS once and freezes in a pirouette, now dressed 
          in a tutu.
           
          BLAM. The Mask SPINS again and stops dressed as a matador, the 
          bullet whizzes under his cape.
           
          BLAM BLAM BLAM
           
          A hockey goalie bats the bullet away.
           
          A Russian Dancer leaps over the shot.
           
          A Cowboy DING! takes the hit.
           
          The Mask staggers back... the forwards in a classic Western death 
          scene. He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support.
           
          MASK
          Ak... you got me Pahdnuh.
          (cough... cough)
           
          Eddy seems touched by the Mask's dying words as he holds him in 
          his arms.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Hold me close, Red. It's a
          gettin' dark.

          Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller
          out.
          (cough... cough)
          Tell Tint Tim I won't be makin'
          it home for Christmas.
          (COUGH)
          Tell Scarlet I do give a damn...
          I... I... UUG!
           
          And the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the 
          side of his mouth. Eddy bursts into tears.
           
          Suddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the 
          foreground, applauding wildly. An off-camera ARM shoots into 
          frame handing 
          the Mask an Oscar.
           
          The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Thank you! You love me! You
          really love me!
           
          Dorian pulls out his own .45 and opens fire.
           
          The Mask starts HOOTING laughter and ricochets off the dance 
          floor.
           
          Dorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are KICKED 
          OPEN and Kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with 
          THEIR 
          guns drawn.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Drop it, Tyrel!
           
          Dorian lets his .45 CLATTER to the ground. Kellaway retrieves it.
           
          DORIAN
          Hello, Kellaway. You got a
          warrant or did you just drop by
          for a night cap?
           
          KELLAWAY
          I got probable cause. A couple
          of your boys were spotted knocking
          over Edge City Bank.
           
          One of his men begins to roughly frisk Dorian
           
          DORIAN
          Easy, junior. You're givin' me
          a woodey.
           
          KELLWAY
          One of them was wearin' some kind
          of big green mask.
           
          DORIAN
          For once you're on the right
          track, but that's not one of my
          men. Maybe you ought to try a
          little actual police work instead
          of this harassment bullshit.
           
          KELLAWAY
          This isn't harassment. You want
          to see some harassment?
          (to his men)
          Search the place, boys.
           
          His men begin to tear the club apart.
           
          DORIAN
          Ever wonder why you didn't make
          Captain, asshole? I got friends
          so high up they'd give you a nose
          bleed.
           
          Kellaway hauls off and CRACKS him in the face with a solid right 
          cross.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Well what d'ya know? I guess they
          gave you one too.
           
          Dorian shakes it off and glares at him.
           
          DORIAN
          (SOFTLY)
          You're a dead man.
           
          One of the officers now appears on the stairway.
           
          OFFICER
          Lt., we got a stiff upstairs.
          One of the guys from the heist.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (cuffs him)
          Better call that high-priced
          lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're
          comin' downtown.
           
          DORIAN
          I'll be back on the streets before
          sunrise and you know it.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Then just think of this as the
          city's way of showing you a little
          hospitality.
          (pats him on the cheek)
          I'll stop by to tuck you in
          myself.
           
          As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on 
          the dance floor.
           
          CLOSER
           
          Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the 
          Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric 
          Kellaway saw Stalney 
          wearing that morning.
           
          EXT. CLUB
           
          Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened 
          into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the 
          Mask. The eyes 
          follow Kellaway as he speaks to TWO COPS guarding the door.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You're on your own, boys.
           
          COP
          Don't worry, Lt. If he's in
          there, well get him.
           
          Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket.
           
          KELLAWAY
          And if he's not, I got a
          feeling I know where to find him.
           
          As Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster 
          (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind 
          unsuspecting policemen 
          and around the corner to safety.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - DAWN
           
          Milo GROWLS, Frisbee in mouth. Stanley wakes up with a massive 
          headache and dark rings under his eyes. The Mask, which lies on 
          the pillow 
          next to him is taking a greater and greater toll. There's a 
          BANGING on the door.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
          Police. Open up.
           
          Stanley runs to the closet to hide the Mask. The instant he opens 
          the door, an avalanche of CASH pours out, suffocating him.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh my god!
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
          Ipkiss! I know you're in there.
           
          Stanley grabs the Frisbee and starts shoveling the money back 
          into the closet. Now the doorbell starts RINGING.
           
          STANLEY
          All right, I'm coming!
           
          Stanley tosses the Mask and the Frisbee into the closet and SLAMS 
          it shut. He scoops up a few stray dollars and throws them under 
          the bed.
           
          He hurries to the door and opens it, an easy smile on his face.
           
          STANLEY
          Lieutenant, what a surprise! What
          can I do for you?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You can answer a few questions.
           
          STANLEY
          I've got to get ready for work.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Trust me. Your bank's opening
          late today.
           
          Kellaway steps into the apartment, without waiting for an 
          invitation. Stanley glances nervously back at the closet. Milo is 
          scratching at the door.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Where were you last night?
           
          STANLEY
          Here... mostly. Is something
          wrong?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe
          it's all just a crazy coincidence
          that this so called "Mask"
          character always seems to be
          wherever you are.
           
          STANLEY
          Mask -- who?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Don't insult my intelligence,
          Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in
          your building, then the bank where
          you work and now I find this at
          the Monkey's Paw.
           
          He displays the TORN PIECE OF FABRIC. It matches the piece 
          missing in Stanley's pajamas. Stanley wilts.
           
          Milo YAPS and leaps up, trying to open the closet door.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo. No!
          (moves the dog away)
          Okay, so I went out on the town
          last night. A guy's got to have
          a little fun.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          In your jammies?
           
          Milo is back at the closet door. He's just about got it open as 
          Stanley turns the detective to the door.
           
          STANLEY
          Naw, I just took 'em with me in
          case I didn't make it home. I
          don't know about you, Lieutenant.
          But I've got a pretty good track
          record with the ladies.
           
          Kellaway pulls away from Stanley and begins suspiciously SNIFFING 
          the air around him.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Wait a second... you smell that?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SNIFFS)
          Bullshit. I hate the smell of
          bullshit. Don't even think about
          leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be
          in touch.
           
          Kellaway SLAMS the front door, just as the closet door falls open 
          -- spilling all the cash. Milo happily snatches his Frisbee. 
          Stanley sinks back 
          down on his bed.
           
          STANLEY
          What are we gonna do, Milo? What
          are we gonna do?
           
          C.U. - VIDEO MONITOR
           
          A replay of the bank robbery, from the bank's grainy videocams. A 
          blurred image of the Mask is visible as he zig-zags around the 
          bank at high 
          speed.
           
          WIDER
           
          Kellaway sips a cup of brackish coffee as Oliveras FREEZE-FRAMES 
          the best image of the Mask. There's a wild-eyed look of glee on 
          his face as 
          he stuffs sacks full of money.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          I don't know, boss. That's one
          helluva rubber mask.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Where's the lab report?
           
          Oliveras hands it over.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          We got fingerprints on some of
          the currency, but nothing matches
          Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy
          beat 'em to the punch.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Get the bank's employee files and
          run down the prints on a guy named
          Ipkiss.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          You figure it was an inside job?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Yeah, and all I need is a couple
          of prints to lock this wack job
          up 'till doomsday.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE - DAY
           
          Dorian's assembled a war council. At the table are Sweet Eddy and 
          assorted Button Men from the city's underworld. An open attache 
          case filled 
          with stacks of money sits before Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          A fifty thousand dollar reward
          to the man who finds this "Mask"
          character before the cops do.
          Get the word out to every street
          hustler and low life in this town.
          (pounds his fist)
          I want him here. In my office.
          Alive. By tomorrow! Now get
          going!
           
          Everybody scrambles out of their seats.
           
          Tina sits in the corner of the room, painting her nails. She 
          glances up at Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          What are you looking at?
           
          TINA
          You. You're losing it Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          I'm losing nothing. Except maybe
          some extra baggage I don't need
          around here.
           
          TINA
          What's that supposed to mean?
           
          DORIAN
          You weren't putting up much of
          a fight when that green goon
          kissed you last night.
           
          TINA
          C'mon, did it look to you like
          I had a choice?
           
          DORIAN
          Maybe you did and maybe you
          didn't, but I know this, one day
          real soon I'm gonna run this town
          and when I do there's gonna be
          payback for anyone who crossed
          me.
          (glares at her)
          I mean anyone.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. BANK - DAY
           
          The place is in general disarray but still functioning, jammed 
          with worried depositors. Stanley makes his way to his desk, his 
          face pale and 
          unshaven. Dark circles ring his eyes.
           
          MR. DICKEY
          Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our
          hands here and you stroll in over
          an hour late. If I have to put
          up with your slovenly...
           
          Stanley develops an odd facial TWITCH, then...
           
          STANLEY
          (EXPLODES)
          Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell
          your daddy how you're running this
          branch like it's your own personal
          piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw
          some of those files we could
          arrange a little vacation for you
          at Club Fed!
           
          Dickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst, 
          then...
           
          MR. DICKEY
          That will be all, Ipkiss.
           
          Dickey turns on his heels and exits. Charlie Schumacher now 
          appears glowing with new respect for Stanley.
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah! What side of who's bed did
          you wake up on?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm not sure.
          (TWITCHES)
          I haven't exactly been myself
          lately.
           
          For a split second, Stanley's entire face CONTORTS into an 
          alarming Mask-like expression.
           
          CHARLIE
          (WARILY)
          Yeah, well you look like you
          could use a little R and R there
          buddy... and as a matter of fact
          I've got just the ticket. Or
          should I say tickets?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm afraid to ask.
           
          Charlie flashes two tickets.
           
          CHARLIE
          Saturday night. Grand opening
          of the Valhalla Casino. Serious
          skirt alert. Everybody who's
          anybody will be there. What do
          you say?
           
          STANELY
          I don't know Charlie, I...
           
          Stanley suddenly spots Tina making her way across the room to his 
          desk.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Excuse me a second.
           
          ANGLE ON STANLEY'S DESK
           
          STANLEY
          Tina... What are you doing here?
           
          TINA
          I heard about the robbery. I
          guess I just wanted to make sure
          you were okay.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, don't worry about me.
          (TWITCHES)
          I'm fine.
           
          TINA
          Are you sure? You look a
          little...
           
          STANLEY
          I'm just having a little trouble
          sleeping is all.
          (BEAT)
          I guess you won't want to open
          that account after all this...
           
          TINA
          I'm not so sure I'll have much
          to open an account with anymore.
           
          STANLEY
          What about the nightclub? I
          thought you were doing great.
           
          TINA
          I don't know how much longer I
          can stay there Stanley. Things
          are getting a little intense.
           
          STANLEY
          Well, there must be plenty of
          other places you could sing.
          Maybe even get a record deal...
           
          TINA
          I wish it was that easy. There's
          thousands of girls out there just
          like me who...
           
          STANLEY
          Not just like you. You've got
          a voice like... like an angel.
           
          TINA
          (lights a cigarette)
          An angel huh? That's the first
          time I've heard that one.
           
          STANLEY
          No, I mean it. You really do.
           
          TINA
          I can vamp my way through a tune.
          But that's not really singing.
           
          STANLEY
          What is it with you, Tina? Why
          don't you believe in yourself?
           
          TINA
          (SIGHS)
          I guess I've just heard a lot of
          promises from a lot of guys. In
          the end they all wanted the same
          thing and it wasn't a song.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe you've been singing for
          the wrong guys.
           
          TINA
          I'm not so sure there's any other
          kind. Not for me, anyway.
          (RISES)
          Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt.
           
          STANLEY
          Yeah.
           
          TINA
          What about this guy, the Mask?
          Do the cops have a line on him?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm not sure. Why are you
          interested?
           
          TINA
          Promise you won't say anything?
           
          STANLEY
          Sure.
           
          TINA
          He came to the club last night
          and he was just so... well,
          different. I haven't been able
          to get him off my mind.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? They say he's pretty
          weird looking.
           
          TINA
          Yeah. He's ugly... but he's kinda
          cool... y'know, like Mick Jagger.
           
          STANLEY
          You really think so?
           
          TINA
          Yeah. If you hear anything about
          him, would you call me at the
          club?
           
          Stanley nods - unsure of what to say. Tina opens the door, but 
          before she exits...
           
          STANLEY
          Actually... I sort of know the
          guy.
           
          TINA
          What?
           
          STANLEY
          The Mask. We're - old college
          buddies him and I.
           
          TINA
          Are you serious?
           
          STANLEY
          Oh yeah. To tell you the truth,
          I'm sorta covering for him on this
          bank thing. He's not such a bad
          guy, really. He just gets a
          little carried away.
           
          TINA
          I'll say. Do you think you could
          give him a message?
           
          STANLEY
          I suppose so.
           
          TINA
          Tell him I want to see him again
           
          STANLEY
          When? I mean, I'd need to tell
          him exactly.
           
          TINA
          How about seven o'clock tonight
          at Peninsula Park.
           
          STANLEY
          I'll be... I mean, I'll make sure
          he's there.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - GARAGE - AFTERNOON
           
          Peggy parks her car in her space, locks it up and beeps on the 
          car horn.
           
          When she turns, she notices a shadowy FIGURE watching her from a 
          bark corner of the garage.
           
          She hurries down the row of parked cars, clutching her purse to 
          her side.
           
          The figure follows at a slow but relentless pace.
           
          Peggy fumbles for her keys, finally finds the correct one and 
          enters the building.
           
          INT. APARTMENT HALL
           
          Peggy is relieved as she reaches her apartment door and slips the 
          key in the lock... but the lock is jammed.
           
          She tries and tries again... nothing. Suddenly, a hand enters 
          frame and SLAPS an eviction notice on her door.
           
          LANDLORD
          Sorry, doll. I had the locks
          changed this afternoon.
           
          PEGGY
          You what? You can't do that!
           
          LANDLORD
          You've known we're going condo
          for six months, Peggy. I can't
          stall the owner a minute longer.
          Either you pony up the downpayment
          or you're out.
           
          PEGGY
          Just a couple more days, Phil.
          The paper's ready to give me a
          full time job.
           
          LANDLORD
          I've heard that one before.
           
          PEGGY
          C'mon, at least let me get a few
          of my things.
           
          Phil considers this a beat, then unlocks the door for her.
           
          LANDLORD
          Don't make me regret this. We
          get a certified check by noon
          tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort
          you out of here.
           
          PEGGY
          Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart.
           
          Phil exits. Peggy picks up her things when she hears an off-
          camera "Pssst." She turns.
           
          THE FIGURE
           
          stands in the shadows by the fire escape. He's got a voice that 
          sounds like he's been gargling glass.
           
          THE FIGURE
          I heard you were lookin' for a
          story.
           
          PEGGY
          Who... Who are you?
           
          THE FIGURE
          Just a guy with a little
          information lookin' to make a
          buck. But maybe I heard wrong.
          You don't look like much of a
          reporter to me.
           
          Peggy gulps back her fear, determined to live up to her job.
           
          PEGGY
          You give me something worth
          printing and I'll get you your
          money. What's this about?
           
          FIGURE
          The guy they call the Mask and
          why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay
          fifty large to get him.
           
          PEGGY
          How do I find this Tyrel?
           
          FIGURE
          Careful, sweet meat. You break
          this story and he just might find
          you.

          Dorian and Sweet Eddy casually step through the front door of the

          Sweet Eddy takes a position by the door as Dorian greets Artie 
          the Swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated 
          SMORGASBORD
           
          The Swede is flanked by his gunsels as he's served by a big 
          blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume.
           
          SWEDE
          Dorian... thanks for coming by,
          kid.
           
          DORIAN
          My pleasure, Swede. It's been
          too long. I was worried you were
          still pissed about that little
          thing with Harry the Hat.
           
          SWEDE
          That? It was nothing. He was
          a pain in my ass anyway. Here,
          sit down, sit down.
           
          DORIAN
          Congratulations on the new casino.
           
          SWEDE
          Thanks, but it might be a little
          early to celebrate. As a
          matter of fact that's why I asked
          you to stop by.
           
          DORIAN
          Is that right?
           
          SWEDE
          Here... have a little something
          to eat. That's Svenska meatballs,
          kid. The real thing.
           
          DORIAN
          Thanks.
           
          Dorian starts to eat.
           
          SWEDE
          So, I tell you Dorian, it's a
          terrible shame. I put all my hard
          work into this beautiful casino
          and what do you think? All the
          sudden I got all kinda problems
          with the city. Big problems.
          The whole deal could fold.
           
          DORIAN
          Maybe I can help you out. I'm
          expecting to come into a little
          investment capital shortly. If
          worse comes to worse and you
          really need to bail out...
           
          SWEDE
          What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy
          a sweetheart? Thanks for the
          offer Dorian, but I think maybe
          I can solve this myself.
           
          DORIAN
          Is that right?
           
          SWEDE
          That's right. You know that
          Councilman you got in your pocket?
           
          Dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth. 
          He notices a PINK CARNATION squashed into the gravy.
           
          SWEDE (CONT.)
          Well now you've got 'im in your
          mouth. How you like that?
           
          The Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his 
          meatball. The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin.
           
          Sweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up, 
          jamming a barrel to his temple.
           
          SWEDE (CONT.)
          (to Dorian)
          Now listen close scumbag! You
          want to bw in business with me?
          Okay, we're partners now. I'm
          takin' fifty per cent off the
          Monkey's Paw. You screw with me
          again and I'll send you straight
          down to Hell with your scumbag
          councilman. You can apologize
          for eatin' him for lunch.
           
          DORIAN
          Sure, Swede. Take it easy.
           
          SWEDE
          Good. Now get out of my sight.
           
          Dorian rises.
           
          SWEDE
          Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets
          to my grand opening. Stop by.

          Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just
          obsessional dellusion. What you

          a piece of wood.
           
          STANELY
          But your book says masks...
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          My book uses masks as a metaphor
          for our complex personalities.
          The masks we must present to the
          outside world... to suppress the
          id. To protect our innermost
          desires.
           
          STANELY
          Yeah, well this one works in
          reverse.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          You're going to have to be willing
          to work on this delusion or...
           
          STANLEY
          It's not a delusion! Alright,
          I'll prove it to you if I have
          to, but I won't be responsible
          for the consequences.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no
          such thing as a magical mask.
           
          STANLEY
          (holds up mask)
          Last chance to hide all dangerous
          objects.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Alright then, go on. You're not
          going to frighten me.
           
          Stanley takes a deep breath and shoves the mask onto his face.
           
          STANLEY
          Whooooooooaaaaa...
           
          He starts spinning around.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Whoa, what?
           
          Stanley just stands there like an idiot. Nothing happened. He 
          tries it again. Same result.
           
          STANLEY
          It didn't work?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Does that surprise you? The mask
          is nothing but a reflection of
          you - the inner you.
           
          Stanley isn't listening. He's thinking out load.
           
          STANLEY
          It worked last night. And the
          night before. Maybe it only works
          at night... What kind of mask
          did you say this was.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Scandinavian. It looks like a
          representation of Loki, the Norse
          God of Mischief. He supposedly
          caused so much trouble that Odin
          banished him from Valhalla
          forever.
           
          STANLEY
          (GASPS)
          What if he banished him... into
          a mask?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          (SIGHS)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we're out
          of time.
           
          STANLEY
          But what should I do about my date?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Your date?
           
          STANLEY
          You know. Tonight. The park.
          Tina. Do I go as myself of the
          Mask?
           
          Dr. Neuman puts an arm around Stanley and leads him to the door.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven't you
          been listening to anything I've
          been saying? Go as yourself.
          And as the Mask.
          (a beat)
          Because they are the one and the same,
          beautiful person
           
          Stanley sees this is a losing battle. He turns and walks out.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. FORD TAURUS - DAY
           
          Lt. Kellaway sits in this unmarked police car, finishing up 
          lunch. The police band comes on. Kellaway grabs it.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Yeah?
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          I've got that cross-check from
          the bank files.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          And?
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          It's Ipkiss, Alright. Stanley
          Ipkiss.
           
          Kellaway smiles to himself. At that moment -
           
          STANLEY
           
          comes out of Dr. Neuman's office building. He gets in his car and 
          drives off.
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          You want us to pick him up?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Don't do a thing until I tell you.
          Just keep the SWAT team standing
          by. If this guy's half as bad
          as he's supposed to be we'll need
          all the help we can get.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
           
          fires up his engine and pulls away.
           
          EXT. PARK - SUNSET
           
          Topiaried ivy reads: "Welcome to Peninsula Park." A small sign 
          below that reads: "No dumping."
           
          Carrying his briefcase, Stanley enters the park.
           
          EXT. BENCH
           
          Stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into 
          Tina.
           
          TINA
          Stanley, what are you doing here?
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early.
           
          TINA
          A little.
           
          STANLEY
          I just... wanted to make sure you
          two got together okay.
           
          TINA
          That's nice.
          (sits down)
          You know, I hardly ever stop by
          here. It's hard to believe it
          was just a garbage heap.
           
          STANLEY
          (looking at the sky)
          It's always beautiful at sunset.
          Those methane emissions really
          pick up the colors.
           
          TINA
          Wow. They really do. All those
          pinks and greens.
           
          STANLEY
          Well... I'm sure my cousin will
          be along any minute. He never
          shows up anywhere 'till after
          sundown. He's sort of strange
          that way.
          (RISES)
          I guess I'll get going.
           
          TINA
          No, Stanley. Stay for a second.
          I was thinking about what you said
          and I, uh, I want you to know I
          appreciate it. Maybe you're
          right. If I believed in myself
          a little more I wouldn't rely on
          guys like Dorian.
           
          STANLEY
          Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel?
           
          TINA
          Yeah. He's sort of my manager.
           
          STANLEY
          Tina, you've got to be careful
          of that guy. He's a dangerous
          criminal.
           
          TINA
          You really mean that, don't you?
           
          STANLEY
          Absolutely. You ought to hear
          the stories...
           
          TINA
          No, I mean, you're really worried
          about me. That's... real sweet,
          Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          C'mon, Tina this is serious. How
          involved are you with this guy?
           
          TINA
          I can take care of myself,
          Stanley. I always have.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, really? People close to Tyrel
          have a nasty habit of turning up
          dead, or haven't you noticed?
           
          TINA
          Look, this may sound a little cold
          but I do what I have to do to get
          by, okay? I'm nobody in this town
          without Dorian.
           
          STANLEY
          And who are you with him Tina?
          I'm not exactly sure who I am
          anymore but at least I'm trying
          to find out. If you really had
          any faith in yourself, you
          wouldn't be hanging on to some
          kind of free ride.
           
          That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over 
          them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (SIGHS)
          I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better
          get going.
           
          Stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees.
           
          TINA
          (RISES)
          Stanley... wait!
           
          But he's already disappeared. Tina starts to follow after when 
          she hears a strange WHOOOSH. A whirlwind begins to kick up the 
          leaves all 
          around her.
           
          The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory 
          and literally sweeps her off her feet. With his lower lip thrust 
          out he romances 
          Tina in a deep syrupy French voice.
           
          THE MASK
          Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je'
          taime, Je any old tame! At last
          we are together mon petite bon
          bon!
           
          ANGLE ON THE BUSHES
           
          Kellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a 
          distance. He speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones.
           
          KELLAWAY
          This is Kellaway. I need back
          up and I need it now! Every
          available man down to Peninsula
          Park.
           
          INT. NEWSROOM - BULLPEN
           
          MURRAY, an old timer newshound hurries into the room, grabs his
          notebook and pulls on his coat.
           
          MURRAY
          Looks like it's gonna be a long
          night. My wife is gonna kill me.
           
          PEGGY
          What is it, Murray?
           
          MURRAY
          The cops got your pal Ipkiss
          staked out at Peninsula Park.
          We just picked it up over the
          police band.
           
          PEGGY
          Let me cover it, Murray! You go
          on home to Claire.
           
          MURRAY
          I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey
          said...
           
          PEGGY
          (grabs her coat)
          I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks
          a million. I owe you one.
           
          She gives Murray a quick peck on the cheek and runs out the door.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. PENINSULA PARK
           
          The Mask is all over Tina like a cheap suit, stroking her hair 
          grabbing her bod. She's definitely having second thoughts about 
          him as he backs 
          her up to the bench.
           
          THE MASK
          Our love is like a red red rose,
          and I'm feeling so thorny already,
          I'd like to nip you in the bud!
           
          She ducks his grab, but he recovers smoothly, flipping out a pack 
          of cigarettes. He pops one in her mouth.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Cigarette?
           
          His hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes in 
          her mouth.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Regular? Menthol? Filter?
          Cigar? Cigarette? Tiparillo?
           
          He produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on 
          the flame.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Let me get that for you!
           
          He grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one, puts 
          them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch. With one mighty 
          SSSUCK 
          he smokes them all down to gray ash.
           
          Beat.
           
          The ash tumbles away.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          (exhales a huge cloud of smoke)
          Aaaaaah. And now... amore!
           
          He throws his arms wide and lunges at Tina.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Freeze!
           
          The Mask freezes in mid-air, arms outstretched and feet suspended 
          off the ground.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Put your hands up!
           
          The Mask's lips barely move as he speaks in a tiny voice out the 
          side of his mouth.
           
          THE MASK
          But eu 'tol me 'oo freeze!
           
          KELLAWAY
          Alright, alright. Unfreeze!
          You're under arrest!
           
          The Mask instantly drops to the ground and throws himself into 
          wildly exaggerated expressions of remorse and pain.
           
          THE MASK
          Under arrest! My god! The Law!
          I knew I'd forgotten something!
          (TEARS)
          I was so young! So foolish! So
          full of life!
           
          Tears are gushing from Stanley/Mask's eyes like twin water taps. 
          He puts his hands out and Kellaway slaps on the cuffs.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          What... What'll they do with me,
          Sarge?
           
          KELLAWAY
          Sorry, son. That's not my
          department. Search him!
           
          Doyle reaches into the Mask's zoot suit and starts tossing stuff 
          on the ground.
           
          DOYLE
          Comb - Flintstones vitamins -
          Sousaphone - Bazooka -
          (PAUSE)
          picture of Kellaway's wife...
           
          Kellaway looks down at the photo. It really IS a picture of his 
          wife with a handwritten note: "Call me, lover - 555-1234!"
           
          KELLAWAY
          What the --?
          (PAUSE)
          Margaret!
           
          Furious, Kellaway LUNGES at Stanley/Mask's neck. Two other 
          officers restrain him.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You son of a bitch -- !
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Jeez, I figured you had a sense
          of humor!
          (PAUSE)
          After all, you married her!
           
          Stanley/Mask honks Kellaway's nose which makes a loud AHOOGA 
          noise and runs for it.
           
          Kellaway starts to follow, but discovers he's now handcuffed to 
          Doyle.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Get him!
           
          The other police officers draw their guns and give chase as 
          Stanley RICOCHETS off through the trees hooting laughter.
           
          EXT. PARK ENTRANCE
           
          A twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park. Stanley/Mask 
          races through the entryway, SLAMMING the park's huge wooden gates 
          behind him.
           
          CLOSER - THE GATE
           
          The Mask throws an iron bolt, SNAPS on a huge padlock, SLAMS down 
          a steel plate ZZZIPS up a gigantic zipper, HAMMERS in dozens of 
          nails at high speed and throws himself against the gate 
          panting...
           
          But then his eyes BUG OUT on stalks as he sees what lies on the 
          opposite side of the gate.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.
           
          COPS... more COPS than seems humanly possible. They're in cars, 
          armed antipersonnel carriers, hanging from trees, parachuting 
          FROM 
          helicopters...
           
          And they're all aiming serious looking guns at HIM.
           
          BULLHORN VOICE
          It's all over! Put your hands
          over your head or we'll open fire.
           
          Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out 
          of this mess - then -
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Hit it!
           
          With that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park 
          entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes a 
          pose, 
          now wearing a straw hat "boater" and weilding a cane.
           
          Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as 
          a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. 
          Stanley/Mask SWAYS seductively in time to the music.
           
          A FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over 
          her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song.
           
          FEMALE COP
          They rave about Sloppy Joe - the
          Latin lothario - but Havana -
          has a new sensation.
           
          It's "Cuban Pete RUMBA" by Desi Arnaz! (Yes, this is a real 
          song!)
           
          FEMALE COP (CONT.)
          He's really a modest guy -
          although he's the hottest guy -
          in HavAAAAna - and here's what
          he has to saaaay -
           
          Stanley/Mask steps up to the "stage" and tilts the boater over 
          his eyes, casting a sly glance toward the crowd.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          ("Latin" voice)
          They call me Cuban Pete - I'm
          King of the Rumba beat - every
          time I play the maracas I go chick
          chick chickie boom!
           
          Gene Kelly on acid, Stanley/Mask punctuates his number with any 
          number of sly gestures - winking, nodding, sliding seductively 
          down a 
          street lamp post, doing repeated "splits" on the sidewalk - it's 
          his big number!
           
          The cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment.
           
          ANGLE ON STONE WALL
           
          Kellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall. He can't 
          believe his eyes. Doyle clamors up beside him.
           
          DOYLE
          Hey, he's not bad.
           
          Kellaway shoots him a dirty look.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
           
          waltzes into the street, prancing just inches from the heavily 
          armed cops. His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then 
          his upper torso 
          SPINS until they're straightened out again.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          (still singing)
          Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete! The craze
          of my native street! When I start
          to dance everything goes chick
          chick chickie boom!
           
          Like some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits 
          for the "musical break" to coax the armed cops into JOINING him 
          on the 
          number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of CHORUS GIRLS!
           
          ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN FROM HELICOPTER
           
          The street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops 
          HIGH STEP in time to the infectious RUMBA beat.
           
          EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT
           
          Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and 
          scrambles to his feet. He can't believe his eyes. His cops, his 
          tac squad, his 
          friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing with this 
          crazy maniac!
           
          Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer, 
          "dirty dancing" her across the street -
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          The senoritas they sing, and how
          they sling their sombreros --!
          (It's very nice! So full of
          SPIIIIICE--)
          (dip!)
          And when they're dancing they
          bring a happy ring to their
          vaqueros - they sing their song,
          all the day loonnnggg -
           
          Doyle crash lands beside Kellaway and starts out to join the 
          others, but Kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You go out there and I'll blow
          your brains out!
           
          Furious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car, 
          pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air. The sharp REPORT 
          AND 
          stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music 
          suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the 
          CHORUS 
          line, looking confused.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Goddamn it! Arrest that thing!
           
          The cops - shaken back to reality - fumble for their weapons.
           
          THROUGH THE SMOKE
           
          The Mask takes off - dashing into the crowd.
           
          KELLAWAY
           
          spots the Mask and races after him, calling his men.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          This way!
           
          THE MASK
           
          bumps into an OLD LADY who SCREAMS at his hideousness.
           
          The Mask realizes how obvious he is. He turns away and brings his 
          arms to his head. There's a RIPPPING sound. And when he turns 
          around, 
          the Mask has now transformed back into...
           
          STANLEY
           
          Carrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd.
           
          KELLAWAY
           
          followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Halt! Halt or we'll shoot!
           
          Stanley quickly cuts down...
           
          A NARROW ALLEY
           
          Stanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail. Bullets 
          EXPLODE all around him. Just as he reaches the next street...
           
          A CAR
           
          screeches to a halt - almost running Stanley over. The window 
          rolls down revealing...
           
          PEGGY BRANDT
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley! Get in!
           
          Stanley jumps into the passenger seat.
           
          INT. PEGGY'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
           
          Peggy rips around the bend, easily outdistancing the cops.
           
          STANLEY
          Thanks. Where are we going?
           
          PEGGY
          Someplace where we'll be safe.
           
          EXT. DAILY TRIBUNE BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          The streets are empty.
           
          INT. NEWS SHIPPING ROOM - NIGHT
           
          Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast 
          shadowy shipping room. In the b.g., a huge machine spews out 
          hundreds of 
          newspapers on an assembly line. Everything's mechanized: 
          printing, folding, wrapping.
           
          Peggy hands Stanley a cup of coffee. He's a complete wreck, 
          clothes disheveled, rings under his eyes.
           
          PEGGY
          I saw it. I saw the whole thing.
          What's happening to you, Stanley?
           
          STANLEY
          It's crazy... I've lost all
          control. When I put on this mask
          I can do anything... be anything,
          but it's ruining my life.
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley, I don't know what's
          happening to you, but I do know
          this. That letter you sent my
          column was from a guy with more
          guts and heart than any of the
          creeps I've met in Edge City.
          Whatever this mask is, you don't
          need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss,
          are already all you ever need to
          be.
           
          STANLEY
          Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean
          that?
           
          PEGGY
          (PAUSES)
          Actually... no.
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          We now hear a door open and footsteps.
           
          PEGGY
          (RISES)
          What took you guys so long? I've
          been vamping here for twenty
          minutes.
           
          Dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained 
          on Stanley.
           
          DORIAN
          This is him?
           
          PEGGY
          You have the fifty thou?
           
          Sweet Eddy FLICKS open a briefcase lined with cash.
           
          PEGGY (CONT.)
          Right. When he puts on the mask
          he becomes that green thingamajig.
           
          STANLEY
          (still dumbfounded)
          Peggy, what are you doing?
           
          PEGGY
          Sorry, Stanley. You really are
          a great guy, but I just can't lose
          my condo. You know how hard it
          is to find an apartment in this
          city.
           
          Sweet Eddy and a second thug grab Stanley and hang him over the 
          steel maw of the whirring news press.
           
          DORIAN
          Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money
          from the heist?
           
          STANLEY
          My aparment. It's in my
          apartment!
           
          DORIAN
          Thanks. Now I believe you have
          a pressing engagement.
           
          PEGGY
          Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt
          him!
           
          Dorian toys with the wooden mask, enjoying his control over the 
          situation.
           
          DORIAN
          You're right. Easy boys. One
          thing at a time. Tell me about
          this mask, Ipkiss. How does it
          work?
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know... You just put it
          on!
           
          The Mask FX theme builds, Dorian raises the mask to his face.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Better be careful, boss.
           
          With a CRACK of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls 
          around Dorian's figure. Unlike Stanley's transformation, Dorian's 
          is much more 
          diabolical. He grows and changes within a nimbus of ROARING 
          light. Finally the light dies away and Dorian/Mask rises from a 
          circle of swirling 
          smoke.
           
          C.U. DORIAN/MASK
           
          While Stanley was a zoot suited bee-bopper in hyper-drive, 
          Dorian/Mask is more like a hulking evil GENIE, fresh out of the 
          lamp and pissed at 
          the world. His diamond earring and touches of his neuvo-gangster 
          look is still apparent, but his huge grin stretches out like a 
          TYRANNOSAURUS 
          Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is 
          a deep inhuman RUMBLE.
           
          DORIAN
          What a rush.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Whoa, boss... are you okay?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          I'm better than ever, you idiot.
          Now stop the presses. There'll
          be a new headline tonight.
           
          Sweet Eddy stands there looking disappointed with Ipkiss still 
          held dangling above the churning presses.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          But what about him?
           
          Dorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          DO AS I SAY! I have other plans
          for Ipkiss. Everything's become
          so clear to me now!
           
          Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase.
           
          PEGGY
          Ah... excuse me. If you don't
          mind, I'll just take my money and
          be going. You guys make
          yourselves at home.
           
          Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Must you go? What a shame. You
          and I could make beautiful
          headlines together.
           
          Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder.
           
          PEGGY
          Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part
          of the deal.
           
          Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Of course. You only want what's
          coming to you, don't you?
           
          Peggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat.
           
          PEGGY
          Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't
          born yesterday.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Ah... But you might die today!
           
          Dorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a 
          flash he snatches Peggy off her feet.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          A girl like you deserves
          to have her face plastered all
          over page one.
           
          He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper.
           
          CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' 
          huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and 
          hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers 
          roll out on a conveyor belt.
           
          Headlines in blood red ink now read: "Reporter Killed in Freak 
          Accident" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking 
          Peggy, her mouth open 
          in a silent scream.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          What do we do with Ipkiss?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          The police are looking for the
          Mask. We shall give them the
          Mask. And Eddy...
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Yeah, Dorian?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Get the boys ready. The Swedes'
          expecting us at the casino opening
          tomorrow night. We wouldn't want
          to disappoint him, would we?
           
          Dorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep BOOMING 
          LAUGH. It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in 
          RESPONSE 
          and elbows the other thugs to join in.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
           
          The door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into 
          the room. Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the 
          curtains. They 
          yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into 
          plastic garbage bags.
           
          EXT. STREET - CAR
           
          Stanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and 
          half hidden under a blanket. A thug in the driver's seat pokes 
          his .45 under 
          Stanley's nose.
           
          THUG
          That money better be where you
          said it was, Ipkiss or you can
          Ipkiss your ass goodbye.
           
          He chuckles at his own little joke.
           
          INT. APARTMENT
           
          Milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish 
          their job. He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window.
           
          MILO'S P.O.V.
           
          of the henchmen's car. Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the 
          car window. The henchmen pushes him back down.
           
          MILO
           
          His ears perk up. The boss is in trouble! He checks back outside 
          the curtain.
           
          THE HENCHMEN
           
          finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags. Milo 
          races right by them, just out of sight.
           
          EXT. STREET
           
          The henchmen hop in and start the engine. As the car peels out 
          into traffic, Milo appears, valiantly racing along the sidewalk, 
          DODGING 
          pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
           
          Dejected, Lt. Kellaway heads up the steps with Sgt. Doyle.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          I still can't believe it.
          Hardened cops dancin' in the
          streets... and broadcast all over
          the ten o'clock news.
           
          DOYLE
          The SWAT team got an offer to open
          for Wayne Newton.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          I'm history. The Captain's going
          to have my badge for breakfast.
          With a little pension on top.
           
          DOYLE
          C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your
          fault. Something will turn up.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going
          to fall right into my lap...
           
          A car SCREECHES BY. The door flies open and a BODY comes tumbling 
          out - knocking Kellaway down. He looks up at the body sitting in 
          HIS 
          lap -
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          ...Ipkiss!
           
          STANLEY
          I can explain everything...
           
          DOYLE
          Don't bother.
           
          Doyle pulls a GREEN RUBBER MASK out of Stanley's pocket. Kellaway 
          starts hauling him up the precinct steps.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You have the right to remain
          silent, you freakin' Looney Tune.
          Anymore of your half-baked
          wisecracks can and will be used
          against you by me, personally...
           
          STANLEY
          You've got to listen to me!
           
          Kellaway and Doyle drag Stanley into the precinct - just as MILO 
          charges up. But the dog is shut out of the station.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
           
          Bruised, beaten and exhuasted - Stanley's thrown into a small 
          cell. The KEY-GUARD locks the cell up - then walks away.
           
          Stanley looks around his dismal quarters. A filthy toilet. The 
          cot even worse. There's a YOWLING. He climbs up on the cot and 
          looks out the 
          small, barred window.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.:
           
          There's a dumpster below the window, overflowing with trash. Next 
          to the trash heap - is MILO. The dog looks up at Stanley and YIPS 
          happily. 
          Stanley forces a smile.
           
          STANLEY
          Go find yourself a new home, Milo.
          It looks like I'm going to be here
          for a long long time...
           
          Milo watches Stanley recede back into the cell.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - DAWN
           
          Stanley lies on his cot - staring at the ceiling. The Guard bangs 
          on the door.
           
          GUARD
          Wake up. You gotta visitor.
           
          STANLEY
          About time you found me a
          lawyer...
          (a beat)
          ...Tina?
           
          TINA
          Hello, Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick
          you out for not delivering me on
          schedule?
           
          TINA
          Is that what you think - that
          I set you up?
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know. But I've got plenty
          of time to figure it out.
           
          TINA
          You're just going to have to trust
          me on this.
           
          STANLEY
          Now is not the best time for
          me on trusting women.
           
          TINA
          I ran out on Dorian last night,
          Stanley. I just came to tell you
          I'm sorry. Sorry about
          everything.
           
          STANLEY
          You ran out on him?
           
          TINA
          That magic mask of yours turned
          him into some kind of monster...
           
          STANLEY
          He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa
          in the first place.
           
          TINA
          He's going to the casino opening
          tonight and he's planning to do
          something terrible.
           
          STANLEY
          A real change of pace for him.
           
          TINA
          Half this town will be there
          Stanley. I tried to tell the
          cops, but they wouldn't listen
          to me.
           
          STANLEY
          As long as he's got the mask,
          there's nothing they can do to
          stop him anyway. There's nothing
          anyone can do.
           
          TINA
          There must be some way. How does
          it work?
           
          STANLEY
          (PAUSES)
          It's like it brings you innermost
          desires to life. If deep down
          inside you're a little repressed
          and... a hopeless romantic, you
          become sort of a love-crazy wild
          man.
           
          TINA
          And if you've got a black heart?
           
          STANLEY
          Then the world's going to be a
          very dark place. And if I were
          you, I'd get out of town. Fast.
           
          Tina takes a beat and absorbs this information.
           
          TINA
          Thanks.
           
          STANLEY
          For what?
           
          TINA
          Lots of things. For really
          believing in me when I couldn't.
          For sharing a sunset with me.
          For being the first guy to treat
          me like I was a person instead
          of a slab of meat.
          (a beat)
          And for being any kind of
          romantic. Even a hopeless one.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTENING)
          You're welcome.
           
          TINA
          You know, that night at the club
          I knew I met someone special.
          Someone like nobody I'd ever met
          before.
           
          STANLEY
          The Mask.
           
          TINA
          No... the guy that was inside the Mask
          all the time. You. Stanley Ip -
           
          They draw closer. The iron bars scrunch up their faces...
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          --kiss.
           
          They KISS. A sweet, soft and romantic kiss. Then... the KEY-GUARD 
          pulls her away.
           
          KEY-GUARD
          Time's up, lady.
           
          TINA
          I've got to disappear for awhile
          Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll
          go but I'll let you know as soon
          as I can.
           
          Stanley takes a long last look at Tina as she's escorted out.
           
          EXT. STATION - DAY
           
          Warily, Tina slips out of the precinct. She's about to cross the 
          street, but spots a SUSPICIOUS LIMO, engine idling. Quickly, she 
          doubles back 
          and heads -
           
          INTO THE ALLEY
           
          Behind the station. She looks over her shoulder. No one's there. 
          Tina hurries toward the next street and -
           
          A BIG SEDAN
           
          roars up, cutting her off. She turns and runs back the way she 
          came - but freezes when THE LIMO screeches up, blocking her.
           
          Sweet Eddy and Hicks jump out of the limo. She SCREAMS.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S CELL - AT THE WINDOW - SAME TIME
           
          Stanley watches helplessly as Tina is dragged into the limo. 
          Frantic, Stanley runs to the cell door.
           
          STANLEY
          (to the Key-Guard)
          Hey! A girl's being kidnapped
          out there! Do something!
           
          THE GUARD tunrs up the volume on JEOPARDY, drowning Stanley out.
           
          EXT. DORIAN'S HOUSE - DAY
           
          A slick/modern house on the hills overlooking Edge City. Sweet 
          Eddy pulls Tina from the limo.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S HOUSE
           
          Sweet Eddy and Huey enter and push Tina roughly into the room. 
          Dorian rises to meet her.
           
          DORIAN
          (SARCASTICALLY)
          Baby, there you are...
          (he embraces her)
          I was gettin' all worried about
          you.
           
          TINA
          I just went out for a little while
          Dorian.
           
          Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder 
          bag he got from her car.
           
          DORIAN
          Looks like maybe a long little
          while, right baby?
           
          Dorian grabs her by the throat and SLAMS her against the wall. 
          The pictures rattle.
           
          DORIAN
          You know what happened to the last
          bitch that ran out on me? Do
          you?!
           
          TINA
          (CHOKING)
          No...
           
          DORIAN
          Nobody else does either. Nobody
          ever will.
           
          He tosses her onto the bed. She lies there gasping for breath.
           
          DORIAN
          Now fix yourself up, baby. And
          pick out something pretty to wear
          tonight.
           
          Dorian picks up the mask and admires it.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          We're going to make a big splash
          at that opening. One this town
          will never forget.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
           
          Agitated, Stanley paces around the room. Stanley's eyes pop open. 
          An IDEA! He stands up, clunking his heaad on the upper bunk. 
          STANLEY 
          peers down the hall and sees
           
          THE KEY GUARD
           
          watching a TV boxing match. He's CHEWING on the leather key-chain 
          strap. There's a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the 
          desk.
           
          STANLEY
           
          climbs up on the cot and looks out the window.
           
          STANLEY
          (stage whisper)
          Milo!
           
          EXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME
           
          Just a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then... a RUSTLE. A filthy 
          blanket moves... and MILO emerges from it - tail waggling as he 
          sees Stanley.
           
          The little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window.
           
          STANLEY
          Come on, boy!
           
          Milo gets an idea. He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them 
          as steps. He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top 
          of the 
          dumpster.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Come on, Milo!
           
          Milo jumps from the dumpster. He almost reaches the window, but 
          falls back down again into the trash heap.
           
          The dog leaps a second time. On this jump, Stanley grabs him and 
          brings him through the bars.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS
           
          Stanley gathers Milo up in his arms. The dog licks his face and 
          YELPS joyously. Stanley muzzles him and peeks -
           
          DOWN THE HALL
           
          The Key-Guard's SNORING in his chair. The chewed leather key-
          chain strap is still in his MOUTH. His half-eaten sausage and 
          cheese still lies 
          before him.
           
          STANLEY
           
          shows Milo the guard, then whispers in the dog's ear.
           
          STANLEY
          Keys, Milo. Get the keys!
           
          Milo cocks his head at the sound of the word KEYS. He zips out 
          through the bars.
           
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
           
          Milo trots down the hall and approaches the key-guard's station. 
          The dog stares and sniffs at the SNORING man.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S CELL - A MOMENT LATER
           
          Milo returns, slipping back into the cell.
           
          STANLEY
          Good boy...
           
          He pulls the wedge of cheese out of the dog's mouth.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          I said "keys" not "cheese"! Keys.
          K-E-Y-S... keys!
           
          Stanley pushes the dog back out the cell.
           
          FOLLOWING MILO
           
          He approaches the guard and stops - staring at the keys dangling 
          from the man's mouth. Milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on 
          THE 
          key-chain. He starts to pull when...
           
          The guard stirs and almost wakes up. Milo freezes. A moment 
          later, the guard starts SNORING again. Milo grabs the keys and 
          trots back to 
          Stanley's cell.
           
          STANLEY
          Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see
          if we can get out of here.

          EXT. VALHALLA CASINO - SUNSET
           
          Built on pilings at the edge of the marina, the extravagant 
          Vegas-like structure looks like a stylized Viking castle. 
          (Production note: Key mater 
          shots will be matte paintings.)
           
          REPORTERS and tuxedoed GUESTS crowd around as the Swede and town 
          DIGNITARIES prepare to cut a huge red ribbon and officially open 
          the casino.
           
          Two statuesque BLONDES in scanty Valkyrie (Viking goddess) 
          costumes present the Swede with a gigantic pair of SCISSORS. The 
          CROWD 
          applaudes and flashbulbs POP.
           
          THE SWEDE
          So, ladies and gentlemen with a
          special thanks to Mayor Tilton
          and everyone else who made this
          possible, I give you... the
          Valhalla Casino.
           
          With a mighty SNAP of the scissors the Swede cuts the ribbon and 
          the doors of the casino open wide.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. STREETS - SUNSET
           
          Dorian's limo barrels through the streets of Edge City followed 
          by two sedans full of his men.
           
          C.U. - THE SUN
           
          as it disappears behind the clouds. CAMERA PULLS BACK as the 
          limo's moon roof slides shut. We tilt down to discover Dorian and 
          Tina, 
          dressed to the nines for the opening. Dorian holds the mask in 
          his lap.
           
          DORIAN
          It's almost time.
           
          Tina nervously starts to light a cigarette. Dorian snatches the 
          lighter away from her.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          I wouldn't do that, Sweetie. We
          don't want to start the
          celebration early.
           
          Dorian flips back a blanket covering four compact wooden crates 
          marked "C-7 - Caution U.S.M.C. Demolition Materials."
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Now sit back and try to relax.
          I've got to change for the party.
           
          Dorian slowly raises the mask to his face as Tina watches in 
          horror.
           
          EXT. LIMO
           
          The tinted glass LIGHTS UP from inside like muted fireworks as

          CUT TO:
           
          INT. POLICE STATION - C.U. - SLEEPING GUARD
           
          CAMERA PANS from his snoring mouth down to his gun as a hand 
          carefully lifts it out of his holster.
           
          WIDER
           
          Gun in hand, Stanley silently backs away with Milo at his side.
           
          The Guard chokes off a snore and begins to wake up. He sees 
          Stanley's cell door standing open and goes for his gun... but 
          grasps air.
           
          STANLEY
           
          puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as 
          hard as he can on the Guard's head. THONK. The Guard drops back 
          DOWN 
          on his chair unconscious.
           
          Stanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work. Not 
          bad. Milo yips happily.
           
          STANLEY
          Come on.
           
          Stanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into 
          Lt. Kellaway.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Ipkiss!
           
          Stanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun. He 
          points it at Kellaway with greater authority.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it! I warn you! I'm
          seriously stressed out here!
           
          KELLAWAY
          Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot.
          You're in the middle of a police
          station. There's no way you're
          just going to walk out of here.
           
          STANLEY
          (PAUSES)
          You're right.
           
          Stanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the 
          Guard's gun. He pulls the handcuffs from Kellaway's belt and 
          begins to 
          handcuff the two of them together.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Now what are you doing?
           
          STANLEY
          Putting myself in your custody.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You are certifiable.
           
          Stanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo!
           
          Milo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up. He now 
          looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Okay. Now we have to hurry or
          we'll miss the party.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Of course. We wouldn't want to
          keep Alice and the white rabbit
          waiting.
           
          Keeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his 
          jacket over his gun hand. We hear it cock beneath the jacket. KA-
          LATCH.
           
          STANLEY
          Now move.

          as the CAR HOP attempts to open the passenger door, it EXPLODES 
          off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate Car 
          Hop with it. 
          Dorian/Mask steps out of swirling mists within the limo in all 
          his wicked green glory.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Don't be shy, Tina. I know how
          you like to make an entrance.
           
          He pulls her out of the limo.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          And I must say, that's a dress
          to die for. Or should I say in?
           
          Dorian's men scramble, hauling the C-7 out of the limo and racing 
          off into the darkness with their automatic weapons.

          Lt. Kellaway and Stanley march past POLICEMEN, FELONS and 
          CITIZENS in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as 
          hell. Doyle 
          waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate 
          doughnut.
           
          DOYLE
          Hi Lieutenant. Where are you
          taking Ipkiss?

          Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay...
          ouch!
           
          Stanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun.
           
          DOYLE
          What did you say?
           
          Milo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley 
          instantly pushes it back down. Doyle does a double-take wondering 
          what's wrong 
          with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out 
          the door. Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten 
          doughnut.

          CAMERA ENDFRAMES on Charlie Schumacher as he snatches a drink off 
          a passing WAITRESS' tray and turns to a gorgeous Valkyrie change 
          girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking out of it.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful.
          One look at you and I know how
          your hat feels.
           
          Suddenly Mrs. Peenman appears, pushing her way past Charlie with 
          a paper bag filled with quarters.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels
          lucky tonight.
           
          She jams a quarter in a slot machine right behind Charlie and 
          throws her weight behind the handle.

          Dorian/Mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging Tina after 
          him. He's flanked by a half dozen of his heavily armed men.

          off the exits. They frisk down their captives for loot and 
          jewelry. Orlando runs 
          up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money.
           
          ORLANDO
          We scored over half a mil from
          the safe!
           
          A SECURITY GUARD now pops out from behind a mock-stone pillar and 
          opens fire on Dorian. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
           
          Orlando dives for cover. The bullets seem to have no effect as 
          Dorian rips a Viking spear off a wall display and hurls it 
          straight across the room 
          with supernatural force.
           
          The spear SKEWERS the Security Guard, sends him flying back and 
          PINS him to a slot machine which immediately rings TILT and 
          spills out 
          quarters.

          You can come out now, Orlando.
          I think he got the point.
           
          Dorian hauls Tina over to the Vikin ship where his men are wiring 
          up boxes of C-7 and sticks of dynamite. He slams her up against 
          the prow as 
          his men lash her in place with coils of rope.

          Stanley spots a THUG standing guard outside the kitchen's double 
          doors. He ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea. The

          The Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge 
          wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one 
          OF 
          the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town 
          dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes.

          Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and 
          casually begins to juggle them.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to
          grind with you. In fact I got
          a couple and I'm afraid they may
          give you a splitting headache!
           
          He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the 
          captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          Round and round she goes. Who

          next to him in half.
           
          Dorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat.
           
          Stanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
           
          Dorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and he 
          extends his slimy tongue.
           
          C.U. - TONGUE
           
          The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle.
           
          Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking 
          shield and protects Tina and himself.
           
          Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley.
           
          RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT.
           
          They batter the shield. Stanley's knocked backwards from the 
          impact.
           
          A HUGE GREEN CLAW
           
          drags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One 
          of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          How touching! The two love birds.
          Just to show you there's no hard
          feelings, I'm going to let you
          spend the rest of your lives
          together.
           
          TINA
          You've got it all wrong! I could
          care less about this creep.
          Nobody could replace you, Dorian.
          Nobody!
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          If you think a line like that's 
          going to save your life, you're
          dumber than he is.
           
          TINA
          (SOFTLY)
          Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then
          all I want is... a kiss.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          A kiss?
           
          TINA
          One last kiss.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          (a beat)
          Sure, why not...
           
          Dorian/Mask sticks out his slimy TWO-FOOT TONGUE, and stick his 
          eyebrows back. Hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up. But 
          Tina turns 
          her head way.
           
          TINA
          No! From the real Dorian. The
          guy I used to love.
          (BREATHY)
          Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian
          Tyrel.
           
          ORLANDO
          No time, boss. This building's
          going down any minute...
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          I make the decisions! And I've
          decided...
           
          Tina stares at him dreamily. Ego gets the better of him. He 
          reaches up and RIPS the mask off. SSSSHUPP!
           
          DORIAN/MASK TRANSFORMS BACK INTO DORIAN
           
          DORIAN
          ...to give the girl one last
          thrill.
           
          He plants his mouth on Tina's -- kissing her roughly. Tina really 
          gets into it. But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg 
          that he 
          freed up. And...
           
          TINA DROP-KICKS THE MASK
           
          right out of Dorian's hand. It flies into the air.
           
          A SERIES OF SLO-MO SHOTS AS...
           
          THE MASK SOARS THROUGH THE AIR...
           
          DORIAN, ORLANDO and SWEET EDDY ON THE RUN...
           
          THE MASK REACHES ITS SUMMIT THEN TUMBLES DOWN THROUGH THE AIR...
           
          HANDS REACH HIGH... FINGERTIPS GRAZE IT...
           
          But then suddenly... shockingly...
           
          A SNOUT, FLAPPING TONGUE AND BARE TEETH
           
          soar straight up through thr human hands and...
           
          MILO GRABS THE MASK
           
          as though it were a Frisbee. Everyone's stunned.
           
          REAL TIME
           
          The dog lands back on the ground -- the mask firmly in his mouth. 
          He starts to run away but... Dorian grabs his hind leg.
           
          DORIAN
          C'mere, you ugly little mutt...
           
          MILO
           
          legs pumping frantically, is losing ground. At the last second, 
          he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it. Lightning FLASHES.
           
          DORIAN'S
           
          eyes widen as
           
          MILO TRANSFORMS INTO -- DOG/MASK!
           
          His pint-sized doggy body now has a giant-sized GREEN HEAD with a 
          double-row of JAGGED CANINE TEETH. The plain collar now sparkles 
          with GLEAMING STUDS. RAZOR-TOENAILS distend. The eyes glow hell 
          fire green.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Whoa!
           
          Reflexively, Dorian lets go. Dog/Mask unleashes an incredibly 
          loud SONIC WOOF that explodes glass front slot machines all 
          around them.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Don't let it get away!
           
          Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs 
          between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks 
          BIG 
          Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.
           
          STANLEY
           
          watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less 
          than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope 
          into a 
          FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH.
           
          Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn.
           
          DOG/MASK
           
          uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Get him off me!
           
          Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask 
          leaps away in the nick of time.
           
          ORLANDO
          C'mon! We've got the money.
          Let's get the hell out of here!
           
          DORIAN
          I gotta have that mask!
           
          Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.
           
          STANLEY
           
          burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the 
          detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12
           
          IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES
           
          Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of 
          WATER now trickles down on him from above.
           
          Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie 
          laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but...
           
          DOG/MASK
           
          pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight.
           
          VIKING SHIP
           
          Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks 
          down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer 
          stops. Tina exhales, 
          relieved, as Stanley unties her.
           
          TINA
          (kissing him)
          You did it...
           
          C.U. - TIMER
           
          as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0!
           
          A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards.
           
          EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT
           
          The two front support pilings BLOW UP.
           
          INT. CASINO - SAME TIME
           
          The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to 
          slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo! Milo, come!
           
          Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the 
          boat as...
           
          THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP!
           
          The entire casino floor drops straight down.
           
          THE SHIP SLIDES
           
          straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors.
           
          DORIAN
           
          SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.
           
          EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT
           
          The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in 
          the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water.
           
          EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT
           
          It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog 
          emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables.
           
          They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect 
          romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces.
           
          TINA
          Stanley... we made it. We're
          alive!
           
          Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms. 
          Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back 
          into a 
          regular dog.
           
          DORIAN
          I'll take that.
           
          They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a 
          gun pointed right at them.
           
          Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye 
          holes and holds it overboard.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it right there or you'll be
          looking for this on the bottom
          of the harbor.
           
          Dorian stops in his tracks.
           
          DORIAN
          Drop it and I'll kill you all.
           
          STANLEY
          You can have it. But she gets
          to go.
           
          DORIAN
          Fine.
           
          TINA
          Go where?
           
          STANLEY
          Swimming. We're still close to
          shore.
           
          DORIAN
          Five seconds, Ipkiss.
           
          Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina.
           
          STANLEY
          Go ahead. Hurry...
           
          Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in.
           
          DORIAN
          Okay. Put it down. Right over
          there.
           
          Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table. Stanley starts 
          to put down the mask. But at the last instant -- he tosses it
           
          INTO THE PILE OF TNT
           
          As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him. Dorian 
          FIRES but misses. Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away.
           
          Dorian falls into one of the WALL TORCHES -- toppling it.
           
          The TWO MEN slug it out as a FIRE STARTS. It burns closer and 
          closer to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile.
           
          IN THE WATER
           
          Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel.
           
          TINA
          (sees fire)
          Stanley! The dynamite!
           
          BACK ON BOARD
           
          Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the 
          FIRE SEARS toward the explosives.
           
          But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back. 
          Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees...
           
          The FIRE licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies.
           
          Dorian lunges for the mask. Stanley jumps overboard. The dynamite 
          explodes!
           
          FROM THE WATER
           
          Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up. The fireball burns 
          bright, smoke everywhere.
           
          TINA
          ...Stanley?
           
          Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over to 
          the barrel and Milo licks his face.
           
          And then the smoke parts revealing...
           
          DORIAN/MASK
           
          standing on the remains of the boat. Like Wile E. Coyote, he's 
          charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes. But like a 
          cartoon -- he just 
          shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome 
          Dorian/Mask glory.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          What a BLAST! This mask makes
          me a god!
           
          He picks up the last fizzing, but UNDETONATED STICK OF TNT and 
          laughs.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          I'm immortal...
           
          He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens. At that moment -- 
          the SUN peaks over the horizon.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          Do you hear? I'm immortal!
           
          The sun's rays hit the Mask. In an instant, he transforms back to 
          regular Dorian. The mask pops off Dorian's face -- useless.
           
          Dorian stares dumbfounded at the TNT stick in his hand as it --
           
          KA-BOOM! Dorian is blown to smithereens.
           
          EXT. MARINA - DAWN
           
          There are cops everywhere. Lt. Kellaway wraps Tina in a dry 
          blanket. Stanley holds out his arms.
           
          STANLEY
          Back to jail, Lieutenant?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up
          for the rest of my life. But the
          mayor and a hundred other witnesses say
          Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and
          you're the good guy. So no jail.
          Just a downtown parade at noon.
          (RESIGNED)
          And I've got to be your escort.
           
          Stanley smiles and puts his arms around Tina. They head down the 
          beach. The two young lovers and Milo walk past --
           
          CHARLIE SCHUMACHER
           
          standing near the crowd of post-party VICTIMS being helped by the 
          POLICE and MEDICAL PERSONNEL. He's still hitting on that 
          STATUESQUE 
          Valkyrie change girl.
           
          CHARLIE
          So I deck this thug, grab his gun
          and tell Stanley, "Take cover,
          Buddy. I'll get these folks out
          sae and sound." Y'know
          we should go back to my place so
          I can tell you the rest of the
          story.
           
          ANGLE ON SHORELINE
           
          Mrs. Peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she 
          notices the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from 
          the boat.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Just look at this mess...
           
          She picks it up out of the surf and The Mask FX theme begins to 
          pound in her head.
           
          Back to Charlie and his Valkyrie.
           
          CHARLIE
          So what do you say, sweetheart?
          Let's you and me go back to my
          place and scramble some eggs.
           
          Suddenly Mrs. Peenman/Mask ZZZIPS up and sweeps Charlie off his 
          feet. She's the most whacked-out Mask creature yet with a huge 
          GREEN 
          Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN/MASK
          Hello short, dark and handsome!
          C'mere and give Momma a kissy-poo!
           
          She starts SMACKING her king-sized lips horribly.
           
          CHARLIE
          (TERRIFIED)
          Yah! Put me down!
           
          She jams a hand down the front of Charlie's pants.
           
          MRS.PEENMAN/MASK
          Let's see what caliber pistol
          you're packing there, soldier boy!
           
          She gets a grip and squeezes. AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Charlie SCREAMS, 
          ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life. 
          CAMERA 
          PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting 
          laughter. We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the 
          BIZARRE 
          spectacle pass them by. They turn and embrace for a well deserved 
          kiss as Milo yips happily and squirms up between them.
           

          THE END

	--------------------------------------------------------------

	EXT. ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM

	A patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.  BACK
	FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to
	massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River
	manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.

	INT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM

	MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into
	an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with
	Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists
	and trees and small boats and distant humans.

	INT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM

	MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
	ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping
	occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a
	man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.

	Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.
	Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity
	of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes
	up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the
	wind itself:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		... Yes.

	Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is
	not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,
	the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.

	He rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze
	outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes
	up:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Yes...

	It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has
	heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He
	can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild-
	ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,
	trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't
	heard; he is not sure.

	He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his
	eyes.

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Yes.

	Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one
	there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,
	should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute
	stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a
	light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but
	then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and
	finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.

	EXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING

	The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
	rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and
	adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,
	speakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's
	older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
	relishing every moment.

	A Painter approaches.

			     PAINTER
		The big tent, Miss Allison --

			     ALLISON
		Paint is rust and moss green.
		Medieval colors -- Daddy's like
		an old knight.

	A Florist stops her.

			     FLORIST
		The head table --?

			     ALLISON
		What about it?

			     FLORIST
		The flowers, ma'am--?

			     ALLISON
		Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy
		loves freesia -- and you, over there,
		lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking
		for a saffron glow -- sort of tea-
		dance twenties.

	EXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING

	Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-
	ing the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his
	watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family
	retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish
	passes.

			     PARRISH
		What do you think of all this, May?

			     MAY
		It's going to be beautiful.  And
		Miss Allison says the President may
		come.

			     PARRISH
		Oh, the President's got better
		things to do than come to my
		birthday party.

			     MAY
			(smiling)
		What?

	Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who,
	on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.

			     ALLISON
		Daddy!

			     PARRISH
		Hi, Allison --

			     ALLISON
		Have you got a minute?

			     PARRISH
		Not much more.  Big day in the big
		city.  What's on your mind?

			     ALLISON
		Fireworks.  Update -- we're con-
		structing the number '65' on the
		barge, archers from the State
		College at New Paltz will shoot
		flaming arrows at it, when it
		catches fire it will give us the
		effect of a Viking funeral with none
		of the morbidity... The Hudson River
		Authority says, for you, they'll
		make a special dispensation - of
		course there'll be an overtime bill
		for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...

			     PARRISH
		Allison, I trust you.  This is your
		thing.

			     ALLISON
		But it's your birthday.

	Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break-
	fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is
	grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.

			     SUSAN
		Good morning, Dad.

			     PARRISH
		Hi, honey.

			     ALLISON
			(to Susan)
		I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.

			     SUSAN
			(smiling)
		Drew called from the AStar, they're
		still two minutes away.

			     PARRISH
		Drew's aboard?

			     SUSAN
		He wanted to ride back down with
		you. Now sit and relax, get some-
		thing in that flat tummy of yours --

	But Parrish only pours coffee.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
			(to Allison)
		You coming?

			     ALLISON
		You've got patients waiting, I've
		got three hysterical chefs, one
		loves truffles, the other hates
		truffles, the third one doesn't know
		what truffles are.  I'd better drive
		down.

	Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing
	in intensity.

			     PARRISH
			(unconsciously)
		I hate parties --

			     ALLISON
		Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're
		going to love it.

			     PARRISH
		Isn't it enough to be on this earth
		sixty-five years without having to
		be reminded of it.

			     ALLISON
		No.

	Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.

			     SUSAN
		Will you relax?  I know it is a big
		deal day --

			     PARRISH
		How did you know?

			     SUSAN
		Drew told me.

			     PARRISH
		Does Drew tell you everything?

			     SUSAN
		I hope so.

			     PARRISH
		You like him, don't you?

			     SUSAN
		Yeah.  I guess so.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		I don't like to interfere.

			     SUSAN
		...Then don't.

	The helicopter CHOPS in overhead.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		-- Here comes our boy now --
		Shall we?

	EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING

	A BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as
	led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter.  En route
	they pass QUINCE, 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a
	portable bar with AMBROSE, the head caterer, tasting wines.

			     QUINCE
		...This shit's not bad.

			     AMBROSE
		-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr.
		Quince, a possibility for dessert.

			     QUINCE
			(pointing to another
			 bottle)
		And that?

			     AMBROSE
		Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it
		for the appetizer.

	Ambrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it
	in a bucket.

			     QUINCE
		What do you do that for?

			     AMBROSE
		Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.

			     QUINCE
		9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come
		from, the sun's over the yardarm,
		m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.

	Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is
	hailed by Allison.

			     ALLISON
		Quince!  Everybody's waiting!

	Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as
	DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it,
	approaches Parrish and Susan.

			     DREW
			(to Susan)
		Hello, Beautiful.

			     SUSAN
		Hi.

	Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for
		coming out.

			     DREW
		Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to
		line up a few ducks before kickoff.
		Any thoughts?  Last minute refine-
		ments or variations?

			     PARRISH
		'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did
		hear a voice last night.

			     DREW
		A voice?

			     PARRISH
		In my sleep.

			     DREW
		What'd it say?

			     PARRISH
		'Yes'.

			     DREW
		'Yes' to the deal?

			     PARRISH
		Maybe, who knows?  You know how
		voices are.  Let's go.

	Quince comes running up now.

			     QUINCE
		Hi, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		How're you doing--?

			     PARRISH
		I'm doing great.  You ready?

			     QUINCE
		I am, this is it.  B Day.

			     PARRISH
		How's that, Quince?

			     QUINCE
		Bontecou Day.  Going to close
		with Big John -- Look at you, Bill,
		all cool as a cat and over at
		Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting
		in his pants.

			     ALLISON
			(to Quince)
		Honey, please.

			     QUINCE
		Okay.  All aboard - New York, New
		York!

			     ALLISON
		Remember everybody, tonight, dinner
		in the city at Daddy's.  You too,
		Drew.  We've still got some loose
		ends --

			     PARRISH
		Not my birthday again?

			     SUSAN
		You're only six-five once.

			     PARRISH
		Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's
		get this day started.

	Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and
	Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him
	As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors.

	INT. ASTAR HELICOPTER - DAY

	The configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front
	of them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats.
	Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache
	case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the
	pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up
	and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
	over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
	He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
	that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into
	her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the
	work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.

			     SUSAN
		I thought you were in a meeting--?

			     PARRISH
		I am.  With you.

	He peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat-
	ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the CHOP
	of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Do you love Drew?

			     SUSAN
		...There's a start for a meeting.

			     PARRISH
		I know it's none of my business --

	Susan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her
	father on the cheek.

			     SUSAN
		No, it's none of your business.

	Another moment.

			     PARRISH
		Do you love Drew?

			     SUSAN
		You mean like you loved Mom?

			     PARRISH
		Forget about me and Mom -- are you
		going to marry him?

			     SUSAN
		Probably.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
			(smiles)
		Don't get carried away.

			     SUSAN
		Uh oh --

			     PARRISH
		Susan, you're a hell of a woman.
		You've got a great career, you're
		beautiful --

			     SUSAN
		And I'm your daughter and no man
		will ever be good enough for me.

			     PARRISH
		Well, I wasn't going to say that --

			     SUSAN
		What were you going to say?

			     PARRISH
		Listen, I'm crazy about the guy --
		He's smart, he's aggressive, he
		could carry Parrish Communications
		into the 21st century and me along
		with it.

			     SUSAN
		So what's wrong with that?

			     PARRISH
		That's for me.  I'm talking about
		you.  It's not so much what you say
		about Drew, it's what you don't say.

			     SUSAN
		You're not listening --

			     PARRISH
		Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of
		excitement, not a whisper of a
		thrill, this relationship has all
		the passion of a pair of titmice.

			     SUSAN
		Don't get dirty, Dad --

			     PARRISH
		Well, it worries me.  I want you
		to get swept away.  I want you to
		levitate.  I want you to sing with
		rapture and dance like a dervish.

			     SUSAN
		That's all?

			     PARRISH
		Be deliriously happy.  Or at least
		leave yourself open to be.

			     SUSAN
		'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going
		to do my upmost --

	He smiles.

			     PARRISH
		I know it's a cornball thing but
		love is passion, obsession, someone
		you can't live without.  If you
		don't start with that, what are you
		going to end up with?  I say fall
		head over heels.  Find someone you
		can love like crazy and who'll love
		you the same way back.  And how do
		you find him?  Forget your head and
		listen to your heart.  I'm not
		hearing any heart.
			(a moment)
		Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll
		come back.  Because, the truth is
		there is no sense living your life
		without this.  To make the journey
		and not fall deeply in love -- well,
		you haven't lived a life at all.
		You have to try.  Because if you
		haven't tried, you haven't lived.

			     SUSAN
		Bravo.

			     PARRISH
		Aw, you're tough.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry.  But give it to me again.
		The short version.

			     PARRISH
		Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning
		could strike.

	Silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Forgive the lecture --

			     SUSAN
		I won't.  And when I tell Drew about
		it, he won't either.

			     PARRISH
		You won't tell him, and even if you
		did, he'd clock it and punch it into
		his laptop in order to pull out some
		key phrases when he gives the
		Commencement Speech at Wharton.

			     SUSAN
		You're terrible.

			     PARRISH
		I know.  But I'm the only father
		you've got.

	She kisses him on the cheek.

			     SUSAN
		Thank God.

			     PARRISH
		He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.

	EXT. 34TH STREET HELIPAD, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	The AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart,
	rushes to open the door and unload the bags.  The passengers,
	Parrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the
	rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator.

	INT. ELEVATOR, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	Parrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride
	downwards.

			     QUINCE
		Hey, this is it, the hour approach-
		es, I'm getting all excited.  So
		what do you think, is it --
			(indicates Drew and
			 Parrish)
		-- just the 'Executive Committee' or
		could you guys use me?

			     DREW
		Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer,
		but it's all set for just me and Bill.
		More people might --

			     QUINCE
		I know.  Gum up the works.

	Parrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince
	when the Voice suddenly intrudes:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		'...I know, it's none of my
		business.'

			     PARRISH
		What?

			     DREW
		I was saying to Quince we won't
		need --

			     PARRISH
		Did you just hear something?

			     DREW
		Why yes, Bill, I was saying to
		Quince --

			     PARRISH
		No no, not you.

			     SUSAN
		Daddy, what's the matter?

			     PARRISH
		Nothing.  I'm sorry.

	A respectful silence, the elevator continues downwards,
	suddenly the Voice intrudes again:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		'...I want you to levitate.  I want
		you to sing with rapture and dance
		like a dervish.'

	Parrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts:

			     SUSAN
		What is it, Daddy --?

			     PARRISH
		Nothing.

	Parrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a
	thing but him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Just talking to myself again.  You
		know me --

	The elevator door opens.

			     PARRISH
		Well, here we are --

	Parrish leads the group out.

	EXT. 34TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	They exit the building.

			     SUSAN
			(to Parrish)
		Are you okay?

			     PARRISH
		A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears
		pricked.  I'm ready for action.

			     SUSAN
		Well, go get 'em, Pops.

			     PARRISH
		Yer damn right.

	Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine,
	Quince looks longingly after them.  Susan, blowing a kiss
	goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a
	cab.

	INT. LOBBY, BONTECOU WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

			     DREW
		...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo
		opportunity, you and Big John, it'll
		lead network news.  Okay so far?

			     PARRISH
		Sounds good.

			     DREW
		It's going to be great --

			     PARRISH
		Do you think I need a haircut?

			     DREW
		Bill, after this deal, you'll be
		able to afford one.

	Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.

	INT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY

	Parrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing
	the overkill decor.

			     DREW
		Their PR guy asked me, what did I
		think Parrish Communications stood
		for, that's principle and ethics-
		wise?  I came up with something, but
		then it occurred to me, why don't I
		ask Bill?  What do you think?

	A moment, Parrish shrugs.

			     PARRISH
		Our first annual report, must be
		thirty-five years ago now, I owned
		two stations, I wrote down a state-
		ment of purpose, that one day you
		would wake up to a Parrish radio
		station, read a Parrish paper at
		breakfast, catch our news on tele-
		vision during the day, and go to bed
		with one of our books or magazines
		and you would always be told the
		truth and in the bargain, have a
		good time.

			     DREW
		That's great!  Wait 'til I show it
		to Bontecou.

	Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec-
	utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white-
	haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55.

			     BONTECOU
		Bill, thanks for coming over...
			(to Drew)
		And how're you doing today, Drew?
			(to Parrish)
		You've got a firecracker here, the
		kid's really set the table.

			     PARRISH
		Good, good.  Glad to hear it.

			BONTECOU
		We've met before, y'know, that White
		House function, the President had
		you on his right and you know where
		I was?

			     PARRISH
		I'm sorry, I don't recall --

			     BONTECOU
		Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I
		want to come in from the outfield,
		bat cleanup like you have, learn the
		plush ropes --

			     PARRISH
		I thought you were buying my company.

			     BONTECOU
		Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy
		Parrish Communications.  I could pay
		for it, of course, but it would
		always have your imprint.

	Silence.  Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits',
	Bontecou holding away.

			     PARRISH
		Well, that's very nice to hear.

	Drew nods excitedly.

	EXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL CORNELL MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

	The busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue.

	INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK AVENUE - DAY

	A thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's
	entrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters
	juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors,
	residents and interns.

	Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman,
	with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front
	of her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for
	the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her
	speaking into the pay phone.

	An attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at
	his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder.

			     YOUNG MAN
		...Honey, you've got to go on...
		there's a time to sow and a time to
		reap, you sow now and forget about
		him... yeah, I liked him, I don't
		like him anymore... because you're
		my honey and anybody messes with you
		messes with me -- I'm on a plane in
		a minute... as soon as I get my
		phone in, you're my first call,
		that's a promise... where you going
		now?... good, hit the books, get that
		degree, one day we'll hang out a
		shingle together... you bet, honey...
		later.

	The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an
	overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the
	counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the
	breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take
	her eyes off him.  He senses her eyes, glances over, his
	cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Good morning, I was talking kind of
		loud there, sorry.

			     SUSAN
		Not at all.  It was fascinating.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating'
		about it?

			     SUSAN
		You and 'Honey'?

			     YOUNG MAN
		My kid sister.  She just broke up
		with her boyfriend and she's
		thinking about dropping out of
		law school.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Nothing to be sorry about.  That's
		the way with men and women, isn't
		it?

			     SUSAN
		What's the way?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Nothing lasts.

			     SUSAN
		I agree --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Why?

			     SUSAN
		I was just being agreeable, now I've
		got to explain why?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I'm not trying to sharpshoot you,
		but that 'nothing lasts' stuff,
		that's what was the trouble with
		Honey's guy.  He was fooling around
		and Honey caught him at it.  One
		girlfriend wasn't enough for him.

			     SUSAN
		So you're a one-girl guy?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Damn right.  Looking for her right
		now.  Who knows?  You might be her.

	Susan laughs.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		Well, don't laugh.  I just arrived
		in town, got a new job -- I'm trying
		to get into this apartment.  You a
		doctor?

			     SUSAN
		How'd you know?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Everybody's a doctor around here.
		This apartment house is all green
		pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm
		waiting for to vacate is a doctor.
		What kind of doctor?

			     SUSAN
		Me?  Internal medicine.

	The Young Man smiles.

			     YOUNG MAN
		So if I needed a doctor, you could
		be it?

			     SUSAN
		I could be her.

			     YOUNG MAN
		'Her'.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Yes, I could.
			(a moment)
		I have an office in the hospital.

			     YOUNG MAN
		-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive
		in this big bad city and I not only
		find a doctor, a beautiful woman as
		well.

	Susan looks into her coffee.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		I'm sorry, you mind my saying that?

			     SUSAN
		Not at all.

			     YOUNG MAN
		How 'bout another cup of coffee?

			     SUSAN
		I've got patients coming in --

			     YOUNG MAN
		And I want to get into my apartment
		and go to work.  Please, what do you
		say, another cup of coffee?

	Two pots are warming behind the counter, he reaches over and
	refills her cup and his.  Pushes a container and pitcher to-
	wards her.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		I see you use lots of sugar and
		cream.  Me, too...

	They smile at each other, fix up their coffee.

	EXT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in
	the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.

	INT. OUTER LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish and Drew enter, no particular fanfare but an aware-
	ness the 'Chief' has arrived, everyone giving Parrish the
	appropriate wide berth, Drew right beside him.

			     DREW
		I'm all excited --

			     PARRISH
		Me, too.

			     DREW
		I thought it was great, I thought
		you and Big John would be like a
		couple of bulls in a china shop --
			(faltering)
		Instead it was --

			     PARRISH
		Like a marriage made in heaven?

			     DREW
		You have a way with words.

	They stride to the main bank of elevators.

	INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICES, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish, Drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but
	tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished
	desks.  Neither looking right or left, somehow Parrish man-
	ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods
	despite his swift entrance.

	He passes through an open set of doors and he is into his
	own suite, commanded by JENNIFER, his assistant.

			     JENIFER
		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Hi, Jennifer.

	Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at
	the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this
	is as far as he goes without being invited.

			     DREW
		So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll
		recommend, we close and it's a deal,
		right?

			     PARRISH
		As close as a deal could be.

			     DREW
			(bursting)
		Olympic.

	Parrish disappears into his office.  Drew, on his way out,
	glides past Jennifer's desk.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		This is our lucky day.

	Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to
	Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but
	Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes
	it, returns to her desk.

	INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY

	Alone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately
	changes.  Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares
	out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the
	Manhattan skyline: cogitates.

	He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he
	flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp
	but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he
	ignores it.

	Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
	pain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to
	massage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands,
	trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some-
	thing is unmistakably wrong.  Now a SOUND which he has
	come to recognize, makes itself heard:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Yes.

	Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the
	source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction,
	yet surrounds him.  Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply
	intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a
	corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other
	clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently
	seized the upper part of his body.  He breaks out in a sweat,
	his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself:

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
		...Yes.

	Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him
	on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer,
	each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself,
	consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a
	hallucination but which he is certain is not.  Parrish is
	possessed.  He angles his face in every direction, arbi-
	trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously,
	enrage, responds to the Voice.

			     PARRISH
		'Yes' what?

			     VOICE
		'Yes' is the answer to your
		question.

			     PARRISH
		I didn't ask any question.

			     VOICE
		I believe you did.

	Parrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and
	consternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence
	and reality.

			     PARRISH
		Who are you?

	Silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Goddammit, what is going on?!

			     VOICE
		I think you know --

			     PARRISH
		I don't!

			     VOICE
		Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried,
		you haven't lived'.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		What are you talking about?

			     VOICE
		What you were talking about.

	Parrish gasps.

			     PARRISH
		What is this?  Who is this fucking
		guy?

	He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping,
	his skin ashen.  Now he addresses the Voice again, searching
	for it in another direction:

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Tell me who you are!

			     VOICE
		Are you giving me orders?

			     PARRISH
		I'm sorry, I --

			     VOICE
		No, you're not.  You're trying to
		'handle' the situation but this is
		the one situation you knew you never
		could handle.

	A spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is
	an eerie silence in the room, a VOID, almost more disturbing
	than the voice that has filled it.

			     PARRISH
		Where are you?  Are you there?

			     VOICE
		It's enough now.

			     PARRISH
		Please.  Talk to me --

			     VOICE
		There's going to be plenty of time
		for that.

			     PARRISH
		What do you mean?!

			     VOICE
		I think you know --

			     PARRISH
		Know what?
			(a moment)
		Know what, goddammit!

	The VOICE is gone.  Parrish searches the corner, but the
	room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by
	the VOICE, it is now just Parrish's office.  Faint SQUEALS of
	traffic from the street, then a KNOCK at the door.

	Parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is
	still wet with sweat, the KNOCK again.  Parrish straightens
	himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his
	hair, blinks as he addresses the door.

			     PARRISH
			(carefully)
		Come in.

	Jennifer enters.

			     JENIFER
		I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish.
		Are you all right?

			     PARRISH
		Sure.

			     JENIFER
		Lunch is 'in' today, have you given
		it any thought --_

			     PARRISH
			(interrupting)
		No.  Nothing.

			     JENIFER
		Nothing?

	Parrish is within himself, doesn't answer.

			     JENIFER (cont'd)
		Why don't I think of something?

	Parrish still doesn't answer, however Jennifer is satisfied,
	correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative.  She has her
	hand on the door, 'Open' or 'Closed'?  He nods and she closes it.
	Utter silence again.  Parrish's eyes search the room, nothing
	there.

	INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE, DAY

	The place has cleared out now, the counterman busy bussing
	tables laden with dishes and cups, Susan and the Young Man
	are still at the counter, but about to leave.

			     YOUNG MAN
		...It's kind of a pro bono job.

			     SUSAN
		'Pro bono'.  That means doing good
		-- Going to be doing good all your
		life?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I know what you're saying.  Doesn't
		pay very well.  Depends on the woman
		I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger
		house, a better car, lotsa kids,
		college doesn't come cheap --

			     SUSAN
		You'd give up what you want for the
		woman you marry?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I would.

	Susan rises now, the Young Man with her, leaving money for
	their checks they head for the door.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		If I married you, I'd want to give
		you what you wanted, I know it's
		old fashioned and all that, but
		what's wrong with taking care of a
		woman?  She takes care of you.

			     SUSAN
		You'll have a hard time finding a
		woman like that these days --

			     YOUNG MAN
		You never know.  Lightning could
		strike.

	Susan at the door now, pauses abruptly, her eyes on the
	Young Man.

	EXT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE - DAY

	The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out
	onto the street.

	Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and
	vulnerable.

			     SUSAN
		I've got to go --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Did I say something wrong?

			     SUSAN
		No, it was so right it scares me.

			     YOUNG MAN
		I've been thinking... I don't want
		you to be my doctor.  Because I
		don't want you to examine me.

			     SUSAN
		Why?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Because I like you so much.
			(a moment)
		You have coffee here every morning,
		don't you?  If I came by, could you
		give me the name of a doctor?

	Another moment.

			     SUSAN
		Sure, I'll give you the name of a
		doctor.
			(a moment)
		...And I don't want to examine you.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Why not?

			     SUSAN
		Because I like you so much.  Now
		I've got to go.

	She hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching
	her.  Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - SUSAN

	She looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YOUNG MAN

	He looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens,
	now he turns and walks on.

	ON SUSAN

	She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed
	in the opposite direction, his back to her.  She turns the
	corner and continues on.

	ON THE YOUNG MAN

	Approaching the corner, he looks back for Susan yet again,
	but she is gone, still turned he steps off into the street
	and a hospital supplies truck, speeding down the curb lane,
	HITS HIM BROADSIDE, a horrific impact, the THUD echoes as
	his body arcs through the air.

	Another sickening THUD as it lands, the Young Man lies
	crumpled, still.

						CUT TO:

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a
	glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky-
	line.  The hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of
	the room are Allison and Parrish, on the other side Drew and
	Quince.  COYLE, a butler, and LUISA, the housekeeper, pass
	hors d'oeuvres and drinks.

			     ALLISON
		...Music, I know how you love music,
		Daddy, and I want to have music that
		pleases you -- and of course doesn't
		put a thousand other people to sleep
		-- I've agonized over this and
		finally settled on Sidney Brown,
		twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus
		I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on
		their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini
		Lopez-zy, I forget their names --

	Parrish has tuned Allison out, he tried to stay with it, but
	his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with
	him.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		You haven't heard a word, have you?
		I keep talking and all you do is nod
		like Mr. Himmelfass in The
		Nutcracker.

	Parrish still doesn't answer.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		You don't care, do you?

			     PARRISH
		What, honey?

			     ALLISON
		I lay awake nights in a cold sweat,
		I want this party to be like some-
		thing Mom would have made for you,
		I want it to be perfect --

			     PARRISH
			(attentive now)
		I know you do, darling.

			     ALLISON
		And you could care less --

			     PARRISH
		Oh, you couldn't be more wrong,
		sweetheart.  I can' tell you how
		much I appreciate it and how I'm
		looking forward to it.

			     ALLISON
		Good.  Songs.  What songs should
		Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we
		can forget about -- what songs do
		you think he should play?

	A stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but
	manages to keep his attention on Allison.

			     PARRISH
		Tell it to me again.

	Suddenly, the Voice cuts in:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		...Yes.

	Parrish's head snaps, startled by the SOUND.

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Did you miss me?

	Parrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who
	has heard the Voice, as an oblivious Allison continues:

			     ALLISON
			(to Parrish)
		Never mind.  Leave it to me.

	Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the
	Voice.  His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful.

			LUISA
		Mr. Parrish, dinner is served.

			     ALLISON
			(to Quince and Drew,
			 across the room)
		Chow-time, you guys.

	Parrish is confounded.  Blindly and disconcerted, he follows
	Allison and Drew and Quince.

	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	As a disturbed Parrish approaches the table, he hears the
	Voice once more:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		What are you looking so provoked
		about?  'Did you miss me?'  It's
		a normal question.  I missed you.
		But what do I get back?  'Not an
		ounce of excitement, not a whisper
		of a thrill --'

	Parrish sits.

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
		'-- This relationship has all the
		passion of a pair of titmice'.

	Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his
	panic.

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
		I'm waiting outside.

	The conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it:

			     ALLISON
			(to Drew)
		Did you speak to the Governor?

			     DREW
		He's coming.

			     ALLISON
		His wife?

			     DREW
		Unfortunately.  I sat between them
		at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was
		better than Seconal.

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		I'm waiting outside.  Won't someone
		come to the door?

	Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of
	himself.  As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa:

			     PARRISH
		Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?

			     LUISA
		I didn't hear a ring, sir.

			     PARRISH
		Please have a look --

	Luisa goes as Coyle continues serving.

			     ALLISON
			(to Quince)
		What about the Mayor?

			     QUINCE
		He said he would be there with bells
		on.

			     DREW
		Good, maybe they'll drown him out.

	Parrish is still not hearing a word, preoccupied with the
	return of Luisa.

			     ALLISON
		Please don't be negative, Drew, we
		have an acceptance list that would
		do The White House proud -- The
		Secretary-General of the UN, the
		Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators,
		I don't know how many Congressmen,
		and at least twelve of the Fortune
		'500'.

			     QUINCE
		No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a
		Masters champion?  Someone I could
		talk to.
			(a moment)
		Or would talk to me.

	Luisa returns to Parrish as the others' conversation drones
	on:

			     LUISA
		You're right, Mr. Parrish.  There
		was a gentleman at the door.  He's
		waiting for you in the foyer.

	Parrish is stunned.

			     PARRISH
			(after a moment)
		Show him into the library, tell him
		I'll be right there.

	Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage
	to go as Allison continues:

			     ALLISON
		I've arranged for favors -- silver
		charm bracelets for the women,
		platinum keychains for the men --
		all engraved 'W.P.' -- but now I'm
		thinking of scrubbing them, they
		seem so ordinary.

	Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		Are they ordinary?  Do they seem
		that way to you, Daddy?

			     PARRISH
		Uh -- I don't know.  No - uh - I
		don't...

	Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into
	disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room.

			     DREW
			(to Allison)
		You're overthinking it --

			     QUINCE
		I don't think they're ordinary.  I
		love keychains.

	INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears
	the doorway to the library.  The door is open.  He hesitates
	before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his
	eye can see, now tentatively, he enters.

	INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club
	chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library
	ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat
	carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from
	the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured
	glass.

	Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in
	sight.

			     PARRISH
		Hello?

	Silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Anyone here?

	No response.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I said is anyone here?!

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Quiet down.

	Parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his
	eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch
	of which is exactly what he has heard before.  There is the
	sense that someone is there but Parrish cannot see him, and
	he does not dare look.

			     PARRISH
			(quietly)
		Where are you?

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		I'm here.

	Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured
	glass, the section of the room most distant from Parrish,
	there is a shape.  Something is there.

			     PARRISH
		What is this, a joke, right?  Some
		kind of elaborate practical joke?
		At my 40th reunion, we delivered a
		casket to the Class president's
		hotel room and --

			     VOICE
		Quiet.

	Parrish falls silent, something in the SOUND and TONE of the
	Voice muting him.  He takes a step backwards.

			     VOICE (cont'd)
		Where are you going?

			     PARRISH
		I - I - uh --

	The shape moves, makes itself more visible.  Although still
	diffused by the glass, the shape has definition, a person, a
	man, his features are not yet distinguishable, but he is
	there all right.

			     VOICE
		The great Bill Parrish at a loss for
		words?  The man from whose lips fall
		'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses-
		sion'...all those admonitions about
		being 'deliberately happy', what
		there is no sense 'living your life
		without...', all the sparks and
		energy you give off, the rosy advice
		you dispense in round, pear-shaped
		tones --

			     PARRISH
		What the hell is this?  Who are you?

			     VOICE
		Just think of millenniums multiplied
		by aeons compounded by infinity,
		I've been around that long, but it's
		only recently that your affairs here
		have piqued my interest.  Call it
		boredom, the natural curiosity of
		me, the most lasting and significant
		element in existence has come to see
		you.

	Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.

			     PARRISH
		About what?

			     VOICE
		I want to have a look around before
		I take you.

			     PARRISH
		'Take me'...?  Where?

			     VOICE
		It requires competence, wisdom,
		experience -- all those things they
		say about you in testimonials --
		and you're the one.

			     PARRISH
		'The one' to do what?

			     VOICE
		Show me around.  Be my guide.  And
		in return, you get...

			     PARRISH
			(breathless)
		Get what?

			     VOICE
		Time.

			     PARRISH
		What the hell are you talking about?

			     VOICE
		Watch it!

			     PARRISH
		I'm sorry --

			     VOICE
		In return you'll receive minuets, days,
		weeks, I'm not going to go into details
		... what matters is that I stay
		interested.

	Parrish squints, trying to make sense of what is happening.

			     VOICE (cont'd)
		...'Yes'.

			     PARRISH
		Yes what?

			     VOICE
		'Yes' is the answer to your ques-
		tion.

			     PARRISH
		What question?

			     VOICE
		Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The
		question you've been asking yourself
		with increased regularity, at odd
		moments, panting through the extra
		game of handball, when you ran for
		the plane in Delhi, when you sat up
		in bed last night and hit the floor
		in the office this morning.  The
		question that is in the back of your
		throat, choking the blood to your
		brain, ringing in the ears over and
		over as you put it to yourself --

			     PARRISH
		The 'question' --

			     VOICE
			(urging)
		Yes, Bill.  The question.

	After a moment.

			     PARRISH
		...Am I going to die?

	The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no
	longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re-
	vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the
	coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off-
	center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Yes.

	A moment, Parrish beside himself.  He cannot bring himself
	to speak, finally:

			     PARRISH
		Am I dreaming this?
			(Another moment)
		Are you a dream?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I am not a dream.

			     PARRISH
		You're coming to 'take me'.  What is
		that?  Who the hell are you?

	The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches
	from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man
	daring Parrish to identify him:

			     PARRISH
		You are --?

			     YOUNG MAN
		  	(urging again)
		'...Yes --'

	Parrish turns away.  But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in
	front of him again.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
			(gently)
		Who am I?

			     PARRISH
		...Death.

	Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what
	he has comprehended.  He surveys the Young Man who, at this
	moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You're Death?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Yes.

			     PARRISH
		Death!

			     YOUNG MAN
		That's me.

			     PARRISH
		You're not Death.  You're just a kid
		in a jacket and a pair of pants.

			     YOUNG MAN
		The jacket and the pair of pants
		came with the body I took.  Let me
		ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?

	A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment.

			     PARRISH
		You want me to be your guide --?

			     YOUNG MAN
		You fill the bill, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		I do?
			(a moment)
		How long will you be staying?

			     YOUNG MAN
		You should hope quite a while.

			     PARRISH
		And then --?

	The Young Man nods, gently.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		It's... it's... over.

	A long silence.  Parrish and the Young Man take each other in,
	the sense that now they understand each other.  A SOUND at the
	door.

			     LUISA (O.S.)
		Mr. Parrish?

	Parrish does not hear her for the moment, Luisa steps inside
	the Library.

			     LUISA (cont'd)
		Will the gentleman be staying for
		dinner, sir?

	Parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then
	at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to
	verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by
	Luisa.  The Young Man interjects:

			     YOUNG MAN
			(to Luisa)
		Yes.
			(a polite afterthought)
		Thank you.

	Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits.  Parrish is frozen,
	dumbfounded.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Where is dinner?

	Parrish does not answer at first.

			     PARRISH
		This is crazy -- you're not going to
		eat dinner with us.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Bill, I am eating dinner with you.
		And your family.  And that's what
		we're doing.  It's not open for
		discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't
		you understand?

	Parrish is frightened by the response.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		Good.  Now lead the way.

	Parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out
	of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer.

			     PARRISH
		Excuse me?  Could I say something?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Of course.

			     PARRISH
			(quietly)
		It just occurred to me --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Speak up, please.

			     PARRISH
			(louder)
		When I introduce you, if I say who
		you are, I don't think anyone will
		stay for dinner.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Then don't.

	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	As Parrish and the Young Man enter, Allison is heard in the
	background.

			     ALLISON
		...Well, here's another possibility.
		It's a little last minute, but how does
		this strike you?  Kaleidoscopes. Little
		gold kaleidoscopes.  Some German firm
		went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these
		things up, they're perfect party favors,
		however they're not personal, they're
		winter scene or something, snow-flakes
		and dachshunds...

	Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward
	pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family
	dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey-
	ed.  Finally, Allison breaks the ice:

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
			(to the Young Man)
		Hi there --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Hello.

	Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at
	each person as if he were discovering a face of the first
	time.

			     PARRISH
		Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away
		for so long -- uh -- this is a
		friend of mine I asked to drop by --
		we got to talking and stuff -- uh --
		he's going to join us for dinner --
		um --

	Parrish drifts into another awkward pause.

			     ALLISON
			(to the Young Man)
		Hello, how nice to meet you.  And
		wouldn't it be nicer if my father
		would introduce you?

			     YOUNG MAN
			(to Allison)
		'...How nice to meet you.'

			     PARRISH
		Oh, I'm sorry.  This is my daughter,
		Allison, and her husband, Quince,
		Drew, my number one, works with me...

	Parrish drifts off as the Young Man awkwardly shakes hands
	with each person.

			     ALLISON
			(prompting)
		Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?

			     PARRISH
		A name?

			     DREW
			(pleasantly, going
			 along with the joke)
		Yeah, something he goes by --

			     PARRISH
		Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh --
		this is --

			     ALLISON
		Daddy!  Come on, a name.

			     DREW
		Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing
		me.

			     PARRISH
		Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone
		right out of my head --

			     DREW
		What?!

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I'm sorry.  This is - uh - uh...

	The group waits patiently.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Joe!

			     ALLISON
		Joe...

	Parrish once more drifts into silence.  (The YOUNG MAN is now
	identified as "JOE".)

			     DREW
		Just plain 'Joe'?

			     ALLISON
		Love that name.

			     QUINCE
		Me, too.  Hey, buddy!

	Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew
	squints observingly at Joe.

			     DREW
		'Joe...'

			     PARRISH
		Yes.

			     DREW
		Is there any more to it?

			     PARRISH
			(alarmed)
		What do you mean?

			     DREW
		Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'

	Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name,
	a furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name
	tumbles from his lips:

			     PARRISH
		-- Black.

			     ALLISON
		Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you,
		Mr. Black.

			     QUINCE
		'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost
		two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in
		1952.

			     JOE
		Yes?

			     QUINCE
			(to Joe)
		You bet.  I'm kind of my Rotisserie
		League.

			     JOE
		Are you?

			     PARRISH
		He is!  Let's sit down --

	Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which
	was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
	Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten-
	sils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at
	his foot.

			     ALLISON
			(to Joe)
		Paillarde of veal.

			     QUINCE
		Yeah, they hit the calf over the
		head with a mallet and then Luisa
		hits it again in the kitchen.

			     ALLISON
		Honey --!

			     QUINCE
		You know what I'm saying, Joe?

			     JOE
		No --

			     PARRISH
			(laughing emptily)
		Joe knows what you're saying, just
		being polite --

	Drew is studying Joe.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		Have we met?

			     PARRISH
		Uh -- he's from out of town --

			     QUINCE
		How long you here, Joe?

			     JOE
		As long as it takes.

	Drew is provoked by the response, but remains polite:

			     DREW
		You and Bill old friends?

	Parrish jumps in:

			     PARRISH
		No --

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		I get the feeling you've done some
		business before.

			     JOE
		We have an arrangement now.

			     DREW
		What side of the industry did you
		say you were on?

			     JOE
		I didn't say.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I
		have the feeling you guys got the
		broad strokes already.  Need any
		help with the details?

	Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		I'm sorry -- business at dinner...
			(to Joe)
		Forgive me for being so rude.

			     JOE
		Sure.

	The doors to the dining room open, Susan appears.

			     SUSAN
		Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -
		had to have dinner with my depart-
		ment chief --

			     ALLISON
		You ate?

			     SUSAN
		...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't
		miss a loose end meeting.  What's on
		the table for discussion?  Party
		favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --

	She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob-
	viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water
	toys and their lips meeting mid-air.

	At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is
	present and has been watching.  She is shocked, embarrassed,
	pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		What are you doing here?

	Silence.

			     PARRISH
			(stunned)
		You know each other?

			     SUSAN
			(lightly)
		We've met.

			     PARRISH
		What?!

			     SUSAN
		-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee
		Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.

			     QUINCE
		Well, I guess he's found one.

			     DREW
		Joe, you do get around.

	Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction.

			     SUSAN
		That's your name?

			     ALLISON
		And isn't it a lovely one?  So
		sturdy, so straight --

	Joe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her,
	doesn't answer.

			     DREW
		Incidentally, Joe, where're you
		staying?

			     JOE
		Here...

			     DREW
		'Here'?

			     SUSAN
		In this house?

			     QUINCE
		Great!

	Parrish pushes his plate away.

			     PARRISH
		Uh - will that hold you, Joe?

			     SUSAN
		Incidentally, 'Joe' what?

			     JOE
		Black.

			     QUINCE
		Hey, this is fun.

			     SUSAN
		So, what are you doing here?

	Parrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Cat got your tongue?  You weren't so
		silent this morning.

	Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy.

			     ALLISON
		Now, I'm getting interested.  I want
		to know more ---

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		We've got some things to discuss.

	Parrish stands, motions for Joe to rise.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		-- Did I hear 'business'?

			     SUSAN
		What 'business'?

			     QUINCE
		Don't bother asking, we already
		tried.

			     JOE
		It's so very nice to see you again.

			     SUSAN
		Funny, I don't get that feeling.
		Maybe it's because you found out
		I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

			     PARRISH
		Cut it out, Susan.
			(to Joe)
		You and I've got to talk.  Big day
		tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

	Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops:

			     JOE
			(to Susan)
		Susan.
			(to Allison)
		Allison.
			(to Quince)
		Quince.
			(to Drew)
		Drew.
			(to Parrish)
		Bill...
			(to the group)
		Thank you.

	He makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest
	door.

			     PARRISH
		Joe, that's the kitchen.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

	Joe pivots, and he follows Parrish out the proper door.

			     DREW
		That was 'Joe'.

			     ALLISON
		He's cute.

			     DREW
		Very.

	Susan's eyes are still on the door where Joe exited, her
	face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as
	a tinge of excitement.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through
	the huge house.

			     PARRISH
		...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon-
		certed, that stuff between you and
		Susan -- uh -- threw me.

			     JOE
		'Threw' you?  Where?

			     PARRISH
		Shook me up.  I mean that you knew
		her and everything --

			     JOE
		I didn't know her.  The body I took
		knew her.  The man she met in the
		coffee shop this morning.  I - uh -
		took him.

			     PARRISH
		So there's nothing between you and
		Susan?

			     JOE
		No.

			     PARRISH
		I wish you had said something to me
		about staying here --

			     JOE
		It hadn't occurred to me until then.
		I was just having such a wonderful
		time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm
		here for?

	Parrish suddenly looks very anxious, Joe stops.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You seem uncomfortable, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		No, I'm okay with this - uh - I
		think.  So --

	He opens a door.

	INT. MASTER GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --

	Parrish turns back to the bedroom.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		...Chair, lamp, bed --

	Parrish is in a stunned state, chatters on unconsciously:

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Box springs, they're assembled in
		Jakarta.  Had to stay in a station
		manager's house there unexpectedly
		- best night's sleep I ever had.
		Ordered twenty, they filled a con-
		tainer and shipped them right over,
		I've put one in every bedroom here
		and in the country.

	Joe tests the springs.

			     JOE
		What a good idea.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you.  Would you like the man's
		name?

			     JOE
		No.

	Parrish glances around, a room in which the occupant could
	not want for anything.

			     PARRISH
		If there is anything else, don't
		hesitate --

			     JOE
		I won't.

			     PARRISH
		How long have I got?

			     JOE
		You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Let's put it this way.  When I go,
		you go.

			     PARRISH
		When you go, I go.

			     JOE
		That's the best I can do.
			(a moment)
		...but minute-by-minute, I find
		myself lingering.

			     PARRISH
		...I just saw my doctor, he told me
		everything was fine.

			     JOE
		Your doctor?
			(icily)
		Did your doctor say anything about
		a tiny, undetectable hole in your
		aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab-
		ly weak vein in the further reaches
		of your famous brain?  Were they any
		prognostications about the possibil-
		ilites of a fatal collision on a golf
		cart of suffocating in an avalanche
		on a skin vacation in Gstaad?

			     PARRISH
		No --

			     JOE
		I hope you realize, Bill...in your
		office this morning, that was your
		time.

			     PARRISH
		Closer than that.

	Parrish keeps still, trying to cool the heat of Joe's
	temper.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		...But meanwhile, you are still
		here.  Count your blessings.  Call
		it gravy, frosting on the cake,
		whatever it is you say.

			     PARRISH
		Well, thank you for letting me know.

			     JOE
		Not at all.

			     PARRISH
		And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.

			     JOE
		Good night to you, Bill.

	Parrish gently closes the door.

	Joe looks around, checks out his surroundings: curious,
	attentive.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish, unsteady, starts back down the hall, Luisa appears.

			     LUISA
		...Miss Allison asked if you would
		like to have your dinner kept warm?

			     PARRISH
		No. Thanks, Luisa.

			     LUISA
		Very good, sir.

	Luisa turns:

			     PARRISH
		Luisa --

	She stops.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Mr. Black's luggage was misplaced by
		the airlines.  Would you mind get-
		ting a few things together for him?
		A couple of suits, some shirts,
		ties, underwear, shoes.  Have Coyle
		take his measurements off what he is
		wearing tonight.

			     LUISA
		Certainly, sir.

	Luisa nods, and heads back downstairs.  Parrish enters
	his den, takes a seat in his chair, stares into the middle
	distance, ruminates.

	INT. GUEST ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Joe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and
	wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement
	window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges
	on the bedroom door.  In the process he opens this door,
	steps out into the hallway.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or
	Miro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature
	Ming vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein
	of water.

	INT. KITCHEN HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	In the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor,
	the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.  Joe enters.

	INT. KITCHEN, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	The staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around.
	Coyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him
	for a moment.  In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but-
	ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread.
	Joe is fascinated by the process.  Coyle suddenly hears the
	silence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly.

			     COYLE
		Yes, sir?

			     JOE
		Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet
		you.

			     COYLE
		Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.

	The staff all mumble expansive "Good evening, sir"s to Joe.
	He motions to them to sit, they do but Coyle does not.  Coyle
	shifts from foot-to-foot, the staff is not used to having
	Parrish family or guests in this part of the house.

			     JOE
			(to Coyle)
		What are you eating.

			     COYLE
		You mean this, sir?

	Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly.

			     COYLE (cont'd)
		Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter.

			     JOE
			(carefully)
		'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.
			(a moment)
		You like it?

			     COYLE
		I would say, sir, it is right up
		there with Jif and Skippy.  But
		miles ahead of Peter Pan.
			(another moment)
		Like a taste?

	Joe nods, Coyle fashions a spoonful, offers it to Joe.  Joe
	swallows it.  But he has not yet found a comfortable way of
	masticating, his mouth and tongue go every which way, the
	staff observes him, fascinated.

			     COYLE (cont'd)
		You're a peanut butter man now, eh,
		sir?

			     JOE
		Yes, I am.  I thoroughly enjoyed
		this - uh - peanut butter.
			(to the staff)
		And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting
		you.

	Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast
	to the staff.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I'll be moseying on.

	He heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer-
	ful "Goodnight, Mr. Black"'s, his tongue again licking the
	edges of the spoon.

	INT. SWIMMING POOL, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

	A spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views
	of the skyline.

	Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black
	Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter.
	He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as
	she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection
	from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.

			     SUSAN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		I'm lost.

			     SUSAN
		-- Can't seem to escape you today.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry.

	Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder,
	points to a stack of towels.

			     SUSAN
		Hand me one of those, will you?

	Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the
	spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand,
	can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants
	the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and
	presents it to Susan.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You must have something really big
		going on with my father --

			     JOE
		'Big'?

			     SUSAN
		You appear at his side out-of-the-
		blue, stay at his house, eat dinner
		with his family, it's practically a
		first.  You're in the red-hot center
		of big business and I thought you
		were a regular Joe.

			     JOE
		I am Joe.

			     SUSAN
		Not the one I met this morning, hit-
		ting on me in as nice a way as I've
		been hit on in a long time, but the
		moment you find out I'm my Dad's
		daughter, you act like a stranger.

			     JOE
		That is not my intention.

	Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter.

			     SUSAN
		What are your intentions?  To make
		little dreams in coffee shops, turn
		a woman's head, and I don't mind
		admitting it was turned, I liked it,
		but ten hours later I feel like a
		fool.  I don't get it.  You, my
		father, here in this house, the cof-
		fee shop, it's making me upset, and
		I don't like being upset.  Who are
		you anyway?  And what are you eating?

			     JOE
			(mumbles)
		Peanut butter.

	He finishes the spoonful.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		But it's gone now.

	He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in
	his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate.  Susan holds her
	hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the
	spoon on the table with the towels.  She watches, fascinat-
	ed, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his
	spoonful.

			     SUSAN
		You act like you never had peanut
		butter before --

			     JOE
		I haven't.

			     SUSAN
		-- What kind of childhood did you
		have?

			     JOE
		Do you love Drew?

			     SUSAN
		Come again?

			     JOE
		When you put your mouth to his,
		Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

			     SUSAN
		Drew is none of your damn business.
		Nor is where I put my mouth.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry.  Do you live here?

			     SUSAN
		No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then
		I'm going home.

			     JOE
		I guess what I'm trying to say is --
		I'd like us to be friends.

			     SUSAN
		I've got plenty of friends.

			     JOE
		I don't have any.

			     SUSAN
		I can see why.

	She finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and
	prepares to leave.

			     JOE
		...I didn't mean to offend you at
		dinner.  I'm not quite at home some-
		times with people.  I get busy doing
		- uh - what I do, and I don't seem to
		have developed --

	He drifts off.

			     SUSAN
		Yes --?

			     JOE
		I have a certain function to per-
		form, and that seems to take all
		of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh -
		I speculate - uh - I haven't left
		room for - uh - anything else.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry to say I know what you're
		saying.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		Susan?

			     SUSAN
		Yes?

			     JOE
		Did you know you have a wet spot on
		your shoulder?

	She glances at her shoulder, he grabs a towel, touches the
	drops of water, pats them dry, hands her the towel.  She
	flashes a nervous smile.

			     SUSAN
		Goodnight, Joe.

			     JOE
		Goodnight to you, Susan.

	Susan steps towards a door, Joe takes a step in the wrong
	direction, they almost walk into each other.  Now she takes
	a step in another direction, as does Joe, again they almost
	collide.

			     SUSAN
		Shall we dance?

	Joe is completely puzzled, finally Susan heads for one door,
	Joe for another.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Joe --

			     JOE
		Yes?

			     SUSAN
		I think you want to go to the west
		wing.  Through there.

	Susan indicates yet another door.

			     JOE
			(after a moment)
		Thank you.

	Joe redirects himself, goes to the door.  As they both are
	about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each
	other across the pool, smile at catching each other's
	glances.  Joe exits.  For a moment Susan's eyes remain on
	the door through which he has gone.  Now she grips the towel
	over her shoulders, the one Joe gave her, pats the same spot
	he did.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NEXT MORNING

	Parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with
	their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away
	linen, dusting picture frames.  He nods and greets them as
	he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle
	and Luisa.

	INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

	Parrish knocks, waits a courteous moment, opens the door,
	finds Joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his
	tie.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning.

			     JOE
		Good morning, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		How are you?  How're you feeling?

			     JOE
		'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you
		feel?

			     PARRISH
		Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well.
		This is crazy.  This is the left-
		field thing of all time.  What do I
		do?  What do I tell my family?

			     JOE
		Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything,
		Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we
		had last night.  I felt as if I were
		being treated like a person.  'Joe'
		this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile
		- Quince passed me the rolls -- no
		'rapture' or 'passion' or any of
		those mighty things you seem so
		intent on imparting, but I am cer-
		tain, should you - uh - say - uh -
		who I am - our adventure would end
		abruptly.

	Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing
	of silk stretching across his collarbone.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		But I did so enjoy your family.

	Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully.

			     PARRISH
		What about my family?  This 'adven-
		ture' involved only me, right?

	Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses
	to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Tell you what, you promised that it's
		going to be only me and --

			     JOE
		And what?

			     PARRISH
		And I won't tell anyone who you are.

			     JOE
		Sounds fair enough.

			     PARRISH
		It is a deal?

			     JOE
		A 'deal'?

			     PARRISH
		You give your word, I give mine --
		that we'll do what we say.  It's a
		truth exchanged between two people.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		Bill --

			     PARRISH
		Yes?

			     JOE
		You've got a deal.

	Parrish seems relieved.  He has now, with some difficulty,
	completed the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on
	Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror.
	Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the
	balls of his feet, quite taken.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		This is great!
			(a moment)
		Now what do we do?

			     PARRISH
		Shake hands.

	Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but
	Parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes
	it.  Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a
	broad smile.

	EXT. 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per-
	fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part
	of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.  Parrish
	senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check-
	ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the
	top of corporate high-rises.

			     PARRISH
		You know, I got to thinking last
		night -- with you here, and seem-
		ingly occupied, how's your work
		going - uh - elsewhere?

	A flicker from Joe.  He has heard what Parrish has said, his
	eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but
	he is concentrating on Parrish's words.

			     JOE
		When you were shaving this morning,
		you weren't just shaving, right?

			     PARRISH
		What do you mean?

			     JOE
		You were hatching ideas, making
		plans, arriving at decisions, right?

			     PARRISH
		I guess so.

			     JOE
		So you understand the concept then.
		When you're busy here, your work,
		what your task is, is being executed
		elsewhere.

			     PARRISH
		Of course.

			     JOE
		So you've grasped the idea.  Con-
		gratulations.  Now multiply it by
		infinity and take it to the depth
		of forever, and you still will
		have barely a glimpse of what I
		am talking about.

	Parrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition.

			     PARRISH
		Joe --?

			     JOE
		Yes, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		How about giving a guy a break?

			     JOE
		Make an exception?

			     PARRISH
		There's one to every rule.

			     JOE
		Not this.

	They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home
	in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un-
	characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his
	lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:

			     PARRISH
		-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still
		young, this is not my time --

			     JOE
		That's what everybody says.

			     PARRISH
		I'm not everybody.

			     JOE
		That's what everybody says.

	Parrish is trying to control himself, glances at Joe.

			     PARRISH
		I want to live.

			     JOE
		I understand.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		But you can't.

	A sudden silence between them.  Parrish's shoulders appear
	to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais-
	ing these issues has vanished.

			     PARRISH
		What's it like?

			     JOE
		What do you mean?

			     PARRISH
		What's it like where I'm going?

			     JOE
		Can you keep a secret?

			     PARRISH
		Yes.

			     JOE
		So can I.

	They turn into Parrish's office building.

	INT. LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	As Parrish and Joe enter, Parrish is hailed by JAIME, the
	Elevator Starter.

			     JAIME
		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Jaime.

			     JAIME
		Knight's Reward in the 4th at
		Calder --

	A bemused Parrish walks on, Joe beside him, Jaime pursuing
	them.

			     JAIME (cont'd)
		-- A closer in today with cheap
		speed.  The colt will come from the
		clouds and boom!  Fifty-eight dollar
		horse.  I get you down, Mr. Parrish,
		just say the word.

			     PARRISH
			(smiles)
		I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.

	Parrish and Joe arrive at the bank of elevators.  Jaime,
	back at his post, hits a button.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
			(to Joe)
		You know, everyday I've walked into
		this building, Jaime gives me a
		horse.
			(a moment)
		I wonder if any of them won.

	The elevator materializes, Parrish and Joe step on.

	INT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN - DAY

	Parrish and Joe emerge from the executive elevator, Jennifer
	is waiting as usual with her pad, "Good morning"s, etc.  As
	Parrish strides down the hall, Joe right beside him, he passes
	instructions back to Jennifer who, scribbling, hurries along
	behind them.

			     PARRISH
		-- And call my family, I'd like them
		to come over for dinner tonight.

			     JENIFER
		Didn't the family get together last
		night --?

			     PARRISH
			(remonstrating, gently)
		Jennifer.

			     JENIFER
		Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.

	Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as
	Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room.

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		Perhaps you would like to wait in my
		office --?

			     JOE
		No.

			     PARRISH
		What I'm trying to say is this is a
		Board meeting and you are not a mem-
		ber of the Board.

			     JOE
		I'm sure you'll see to it that it
		won't be a problem.

	Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for
	the doorknob.

	INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him.  A euphony
	of "Good morning"'s from the various members of the Board,
	including Quince.  Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe,
	right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas-
	tries, he heads for them.

			     PARRISH
			(to the Board)
		-- This is Joe Black, a personal
		associate of mine - uh - he'll be
		joining us today.  I know it's --
		uh -- unusual, and my apologies --
		and Drew -- uh -- carry on.

	Immediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at
	Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded
	but intense.

			     DREW
			(after a moment, to
			 Joe)
		Nice to see you.  I didn't expect
		you, but certainly you can't get
		enough of a good thing.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

			     DREW
			(to the Board)
		The Board of Parrish Communications -
		is hereby called to order.  Our sole
		order of business is an acceptance
		of John Bontecou's generous offer
		and --

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Do you have any more of these deli-
		cious cookies?

	A hushed silence at the inappropriateness of Joe's inter-
	ruption.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		And a cup of tea.  With milk, I
		think.  I'd like to try it English-
		style.  Yes, a cup of tea with milk.

			     DREW
		Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about
		some water?

			     JOE
		Why yes, thank you.

			     DREW
		Hot or cold.

			     JOE
		Cold.

			     DREW
		And a glass.

	Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's
	refreshments.

			     PARRISH
			(quietly, indicating a
			 chair)
		Would you like to sit down, Joe?

			     JOE
		Yes.

	Joe sits.

			     DREW
		To review -- we're really crossing
		the 't's and dotting the 'i's here.
		Bill had a great and conclusive
		meeting with John Bontecou yester-
		day, all that remains for us is to
		put it to a vote.

	Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from
	the Board at Drew's news.

			     PARRISH
			(emptily)
		Thank you, Drew.

	Parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something
	official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous,
	reflective, deeply felt.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I
		was interested in meeting John yes-
		terday -- impressive... I suppose...
		But it did get me to thinking.  I
		started in this business because
		this is what I wanted to do.  I knew
		I wasn't going to write the Great
		American Novel, but I also knew
		there was more to life than buying
		something for a dollar and selling
		it for two.  I wanted to give the
		news to the world, and I wanted to
		give it unvarnished.  The more we
		all know about each other, the
		greater the chance we will survive.
		Sure, I want to make a profit, you
		can't exist without one but John
		Bontecou is all profit.  If we give
		him license to absorb Parrish
		Communications, and he has his eye
		on a few others after us, we'll be
		appointing him to the position he
		craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to
		reach the world you will have to go
		through John Bontecou.  And not only
		will you have to pay him to do this,
		far more expensive, you'll have to
		agree with him.  Reporting the news
		is a privilege and a responsibility
		and it is not exploitable.  Parrish
		Communications has earned this priv-
		ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy
		it.  As your chairman, I urge you to
		agree this company is not for sale.

	A silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is
	trying to maintain his balance.

			     DREW
			(carefully)
		...Sounds like you're not leaving
		much room for discussion.

			     PARRISH
			(to the Board)
		Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm
		reversing my field.

			     DREW
		That's your privilege, Bill.  But
		given our needs, given the absolute
		necessity for growth, given the fu-
		ture, the truth is... joining John
		Bontecou is every bit as certain as -
		Death and Taxes.

	Joe interjects:

			     JOE
		'Death and Taxes'?

	After a moment.

			     DREW
		Yes.

			     JOE
		"Death and Taxes"?

	Another moment.

			     DREW
		Yes.

			     JOE
		What an odd pairing.

			     DREW
		It's just a saying, Mr. Black,

			     JOE
		Of whom?

			     DREW
		It doesn't matter.

			     JOE
		Then why did you bring it up?

	Drew regards Joe.

			     DREW
		You're not familiar with the phrase,
		"In this world, nothing is certain
		but Death and Taxes"?

			     PARRISH
		I am now.

			     DREW
		Glad I could be of some help.

	The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by
	his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew
	coolly grasps the irritation of the members.  Parrish breaks
	the silence.

			     PARRISH
		Shall we adjourn?

			     DREW
		But the matter's still on the table,
		Bill --

	EDWARD SLOANE, a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily
	silent, but extremely observant.  Protective of Parrish, and
	sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts:

			SLOANE
		Why don't we let it rest for the
		moment?  Give it some air?

			     PARRISH
		Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall
		we?

	Joe rises.

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Those cookies were excellent.

	He exits with Parrish, the door closes behind them.  A BABBLE
	of disturbed reactions from the Board.

			     DREW
		Who is that guy?

	Drew grabs a telephone:

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Felicia?


			FELICIA (O.S.)
		Yes, sir?

			     DREW
		Get me a Field Background check on
		Joe Black.  Litigations. Bankrupt-
		cies.  Credit ratings.  The works.
		Got it?

	Drew hangs up.

	INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY

	Parrish enters, Joe right on his heels.  They booth stop,
	Parrish regards him.

			     PARRISH
		-- What's the deal here?  Are you
		going to be breathing down my neck
		right 'til the very end?

			     JOE
		I don't understand.

	Parrish tries to gather himself.

			     PARRISH
		...I'd like to be alone for a while.

			     JOE
		Are you sad, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, I am.  There's a research lib-
		rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't
		you go down and read some magazines?

			     JOE
		You're not thinking of going some-
		where, are you, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Joe, could I ask you to take a walk?
		Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll
		be seeing you.

			     JOE
		Of course.

	But Joe doesn't move.

			     PARRISH
			(prompting)
		Now I'd like to be alone.

			     JOE
		Oh.  Okay.

	Parrish reaches into his pocket and hands Joe some cash.

			     PARRISH
		Here -- this will hold you for a
		while.

	Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You know about money, don't you?

			     JOE
		It can't buy happiness?

	Parrish opens the door.

			     PARRISH
		Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of
		the city.

			     JOE
		No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.

	Joe goes.

	INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

	Susan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on
	an examining table beside them.  As she finishes, she
	suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception
	area.  She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last
	notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the
	corridor.

			     SUSAN
		Joe --

			     JOE
		How nice you look.  Is that your
		uniform?

	Susan regards him.

			     SUSAN
		Why did you come here?

	Joe doesn't have an answer.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Are you ill?

			     JOE
		Oh goodness, no.

			     SUSAN
		Then why are you here, Joe?

			     JOE
		I came to see you.

			     SUSAN
		I don't have any time to see you
		now.  I'm doing grand rounds and
		then I'm examining back-to-back
		patients until dinner and then --

			     JOE
		Very well, I'll watch.

			     SUSAN
		Watch me do what?

			     JOE
		Whatever you do.

			     SUSAN
		That's impossible.  I'm a doctor,
		I'm --

			     JOE
		And I'll be a visitor.

			     SUSAN
		Patients have visitors, not doctors.

			     JOE
		I don't mind --

	Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-
	thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is
	holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat,
	in great pain.

			     TEENA
			(urgently)
		Miss?  Miss Doctor?

			     SUSAN
			(gently)
		Just a minute, please.

			     TEENA
		Please.  My momma's sicker'n he
		is.

	Easter looks up and sees Joe.  She abruptly becomes still,
	eyes wide, as if sudden recognition.

			     EASTER
		Obeah.

			     TEENA
		No, Momma.

	But Easter just stares at Joe, fearful.

			     EASTER
		Obeah mon.  I gonna die.

			     TEENA
		Momma, stop it. Is just a man.

	Joe looks at Easter, curiously.

			     SUSAN
			(to Teena)
		What's obeah?

			     TEENA
		Bad spirit.  She just all fever, she
		don' mean nothin'.  Please help us?

			     SUSAN
		Have you filled out the insurance
		forms?

	Teena shakes her hand anxiously.  Joe leans forward to
	Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian
	dialect.

			     JOE
		No obeah, sister.  No duppy, no
		jumbie.  Evera ting gon' be irey.

	Susan and Teena both look at him, astonished.  Easter's
	fearful gaze remains locked on him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Go wi' de doctor lady.  Momma be
		fine.

			     EASTER
		Don' leave!?

			     TEENA
			(pleading)
		Momma.

	Susan leads Teena away.  Easter is riveted on Joe.

			     EASTER
			(with certainty)
		Obeah.

			     JOE
		Obeah evil.  I not evil.

			     EASTER
		What you then?

			     JOE
		I from dat nex' place.

			     EASTER
		You wait here'n to take us?  Like
		you bus driver to dere?

			     JOE
			(smiles)
		No, no.  I on holiday.

			     EASTER
			(looks around, dubious)
		Some spot you pick.

	She winces with pain, gasping.

			     EASTER (cont'd)
		Pain is bad.

			     JOE
		I nuttin' to do wi' dat.

			     EASTER
		Make it go 'way.

			     JOE
		Doctor lady make it irey.

			     EASTER
		Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru.
		Make it go 'way.

			     JOE
		Can't, sistah.

			     EASTER
			(adamant, pleading)
		Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex'
		place.

	Joe regards Easter, a long moment.

			     JOE
		Not time yet.

			     EASTER
		Make it time.

	Joe shakes his head, a firm no.  But when he looks and speaks
	to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret.

			     JOE
		Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta
		be, Easter.

	Susan and Teena return with an Orderly and a wheelchair for
	Easter.

			     EASTER
			(to Joe)
		Please...

			     TEENA
		Come now, Momma.

	Easter is helped into the wheelchair.  She looks pleadingly
	at Joe.  The Orderly starts to wheel her away.  Joe stays him,
	putting his hand on Easter's arm.

			     JOE
		Close your eyes, Easter.

	She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Soon.

	He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off.

			     SUSAN
			(to Teena)
		Go with her.  I'll be right there.

	Teena goes.  Joe remains his normal voice.

			     JOE
		She's in a great deal of pain.

			     SUSAN
		Yes.

	Susan regards Joe, puzzled.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Have you spent a lot of time in the
		islands?

			     JOE
		Some.

	Joe shifts.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I - uh - I - realize now - uh - my
		being here - um - your patient --
		this is not really appropriate --
		and I - uh --

			     SUSAN
		Don't apologize.  There's nothing
		to be sorry for -- every hospital
		should have someone like you.

	Silence.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Well...I'm glad you came.

			     JOE
		Thank you.  I'm so very glad to be
		here.

	Another awkward silence.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I guess you're busy --

			     SUSAN
		Yes.

	She doesn't move, they search for words.

			     JOE
		Well, I could come again some other
		time.

	Susan regards him.

			     SUSAN
		Joe, I'm with Drew.

			     JOE
			(sincerely)
		Not now.

	Susan smiles gently.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Don't you want me to come again...?

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		I have to go, I'm sorry to say --

			     JOE
		Be sorry for nothing.

	Another moment.

			     SUSAN
		Yes.  Well...thank you, Joe.

	Susan turns to go, hesitates.

			     JOE
		Good-bye, Susan.

	Susan waves softly to him, heads down the hall, glances back
	once to see Joe has not moved, is watching her depart.

	INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

	Jennifer shows Joe in, Parrish is deep in thought, beside
	him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and
	silver, but untouched.

	Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at
	Parrish's food.

			     JOE
		Are you going to eat your lunch

			     PARRISH
		It's all yours.

	Joe starts eating, Parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated,
	Joe's chewing has improved.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Good?

			     JOE
		Excellent.  What is it?

			     PARRISH
		Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A
		little Coleman's mustard.

	Joe takes another big bite.

			     JOE
		Truly - uh - splendid.

			     PARRISH
		Glad you like it.  My wife turned me
		onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan --
		that was my wife --

			     JOE
			(familiarly)
		Uh-huh.

			     PARRISH
		Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy
		as roast beef, not as boring as
		chicken.  She knew stuff like that.

	Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		-- Everything reminds me of her --
		there isn't a day that goes by that
		I don't think about her -- One day
		she was here.  The next day she was
		gone.  What are you going to do? --
		I guess you've heard all this a
		trillion times before.

			     JOE
		And more.

			     PARRISH
		Why didn't you stop me?

			     JOE
		Well...I don't know.

	Silence.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		How was it the first time you met
		her?

			     PARRISH
		I thought you'd heard a trillion
		times --

			     JOE
		This part I'm interested in.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		She had on this little blue suit --
		with a little white collar that had
		little red piping on it --

	Joe is riveted on Parrish ow, Parrish aware of him, has
	paused.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You could have put her under glass
		and I would have just stood and
		looked at her.  But when she spoke
		-- I loved the sound of her voice
		and her laugh --
			(a moment)
		-- I couldn't get enough of her --
		and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't
		gradually -- I realized I couldn't
		live without her.

	A KNOCK, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish,
	then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway.

			     DREW
		May I interrupting?

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     PARRISH
		No.

			     DREW
			(to joe)
		'Just kidding'?

			     PARRISH
		Sit down, Drew.

			     DREW
		Before I do --
			(glances at Joe)
		I was hoping we might be alone,
		Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Joe and I have no secrets from each
		other.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		How nice for you both.

	Drew takes a moment, then plunges in.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Bill, pardon my candor, but I was
		confounded by your decision this
		morning.

			     PARRISH
		Why?

			     DREW
		I was hired, you told me, to help
		bring Parrish Communications into
		the 21st Century.  This merger is
		the vehicle --

	Joe interrupts:

			     JOE
		Perhaps a merger is a way to bring
		Bill's company into the 21st cen-
		tury.  And perhaps it isn't.  And
		perhaps cheating on your French
		Philosophers exam at The Groton
		School was an expedient way to get
		your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.
		Be that as it may, Drew, a question
		can often be argued both ways.

	Drew is stunned.

			     PARRISH
		Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		I thought this was practically a
		done deal --

			     PARRISH
		Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget
		Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of
		his fancy name and his fancy offer.
		I'm not going for it.

	A moment.

			     DREW
		Okay.

	Drew heads for the door, turns around.

			     DREW (cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Can I invite myself to dinner
		tonight?
			(a moment)
		Susan and I had ticket for the
		Knicks game.  But she said you
		guys were getting together --

			     PARRISH
		Dinner?  Absolutely.

			     JOE
		Absolutely.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		Damn decent of you.

	Drew exits.

			     JOE
		Why, at this juncture, are you
		letting yourself be so concerned
		by business matters?

			     PARRISH
		I don't want anybody buying up my
		life's work and turning it into
		something it wasn't meant to be.  A
		man wants to leave something behind.
		And he wants it left behind the way
		he made it.  And he wants it to be
		run the way he run it -- with a sense
		of honor, of dedication, of truth.
		Okay?

			     JOE
		Okay.

			     PARRISH
		And I don't need your goddamn permis-
		sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't
		need anyone to tell me how to run my
		life.

			     JOE
		Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a
		heart attack and ruin my vacation.

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	The skyline glitters through the terrace windows.  The hour
	is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the
	family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray.

	Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a
	distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace.  Joe's eyes
	are on Susan across the room.  Her eyes flicker towards him,
	aware of his gaze.

			     ALLISON
			(to Susan)
		...We're never all together two
		nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas,
		Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's
		going on?

			     SUSAN
		Nothing's going on.  Maybe he
		doesn't want to be alone.  He's go-
		ing to be sixty-five in a minute --

			     ALLISON
		...I don't know, Daddy seems funny
		to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's
		like he dropped from the clouds...

	Drew enters.  He nuzzles Susan's neck, out of the corner of
	her eye she sees Joe still observing them.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		...When Daddy walked in with him, he
		couldn't even remember his name.  Now
		he's his house guest.  And you know
		how he hates house guests.  What is
		going on?

	Drew, whose eyes have also been on Joe across the room, turns
	back.

			     DREW
			(to Susan and Allison)
		Good question.

	Allison sees Susan's eyes flicker over towards Joe.

			     ALLISON
		-- But he does seem very nice.

			     SUSAN
		You think so?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Over at the terrace, Quince buttonholes Parrish, Joe stand-
	ing by.

			     QUINCE
			(to Parrish)
		...I read you all the way on the
		Bontecou thing, and I know where
		you're coming from.  And I'm with
		you a hundred and one percent.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		But I've got to tell you, if mergers
		are in the wild, I've got some great
		prospects I've developed.  I want to
		talk to you about them next week.

			     PARRISH
		Next week?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah.  Or the week after.

	Quince sees Parrish hesitate.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		No good?

			     PARRISH
		No, anything is possible.
			(lightly)
		It's up to Joe.

			     QUINCE
		Joe, you don't know how glad I am
		you're aboard.  Anybody who can take
		some of the weight off the old man,
		I'm in his corner.

			     JOE
		That's very gracious of you, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		No problem.  I'll leave you two
		alone.  I can tell you guys have
		something on the fire --

	An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as
	Allison appears.

			     ALLISON
			(to Parrish)
		Did you know twenty-six members of
		your rifle company are coming?

			     PARRISH
		Who?

			     ALLISON
		From the Korean War.

			     PARRISH
		Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.

			     ALLISON
		Whatever it was, they'll be here.
		We sent out invitations to everyone,
		plane tickets included -- the RSVP's
		are amazing.  A few of them we didn't
		hear from, and some of them are dead,
		of course --

			     PARRISH
		Of course.

			     ALLISON
			(a moment)
		You know, we're going to give this
		party for you whether you like it or
		not.

			     PARRISH
		I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I
		don't seem more appreciative.

			     ALLISON
			(resignedly)
		That's okay, Daddy.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Across the room, Quince has pulled Drew aside:

			     QUINCE
		...I know you're down, but you know
		when you're down, Drew, there's no
		place to go but up.

			     DREW
		Thanks, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some
		other merger possibilities up my
		sleeve, and I'm putting them to see
		old man.

			     DREW
		Are you?

			     QUINCE
		We'll do it together.  I'll clue you
		in.  Timing's got to be right.  The
		old man says it's up to Joe.

			     DREW
		'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his
		words?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah.

			     DREW
		'It's up to Joe', huh?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah, that's what he said.

			     DREW
		Well, that's very interesting.

	Drew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan,
	for the moment by herself near the piano.

			     QUINCE
		I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat
		guy.

			     DREW
		Yeah.  Neat.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Joe approaches Susan.

			     JOE
		I wanted to apologize, Susan --

			     SUSAN
		I thought you said 'Be sorry for
		nothing'.

			     JOE
		Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding
		on you this afternoon.

			     SUSAN
		It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it
		was, it turned out to be welcome.

			     JOE
		I appreciate you --

			     SUSAN
		Excuse me?

			     JOE
		I mean I appreciate that.

			     SUSAN
		And I appreciate you, too.

	A moment between them.

			     JOE
			(delighted)
		You do?  Well, thank you very much.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Drew crosses over to Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		I was a little abrupt with you this
		afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want
		you to know I value your advice.

			     DREW
		As much as Joe's?

	Parrish doesn't answer.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Who is this man?  He's giving
		ubiquitous a bad name.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		You're competitive soul, Drew.
		That's what makes you a great addi-
		tion to the money.  Joe is just...
		around.

			     DREW
		For how long?  And why?

			     PARRISH
		Please.  Don't worry about him.  And
		above all, don't antagonize him.

	Drew glances over at Joe.

			     DREW
		Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at
		following them.  And I think I'll
		start right now.

	Allison calls out from the other side of the room:

			     ALLISON
		Dinner's ready, everybody!

	A BUZZ as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the
	family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe.

			     DREW
		I have a confession to make to you,
		Joe.

	Joe just smiles in response.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Do you want to hear it?

			     JOE
			(pleasantly)
		No.

			     DREW
		Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.
		I did cheat on that exam at Groton.
		But so did twenty-six other guys,
		and nobody ever mentioned it until
		today.  And I'm expecting you won't
		mention it again.  I don't know who
		you are and where you're getting
		your information, but I'm willing to
		pretend I did not hear it, and let
		bygones be bygones.  But can I tell
		you something else, it'd be nice to
		see the big guy without you next to
		him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do
		you hold his dick for him when he
		goes to take a leak?  You know some-
		times somebody would like a few min-
		utes alone with W.P.  That means
		without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.

	INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances
	averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each
	other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the
	other hand, just eats.

	Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands.

			     PARRISH
		-- I - uh - want to thank you all
		for coming - uh - my family --

	Everyone at the table is all attention.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		-- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and
		the other members --

	He glances at Joe, stops.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		-- I'm so happy when we can get
		together -- I mean I know you all
		have busy lives --

			     SUSAN
		Look who's talking.

			     ALLISON
			(a laugh)
		Yeah, speak for yourself.

			     PARRISH
		Anyway -- I remember when you were
		little girls --

	An awkward pause.  Quince chooses to fill the silence.

			     QUINCE
		I love little girls --

	Allison elbows him.

			     PARRISH
		And now you're all grown up -- and
		I'm - uh - um --

	Parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew
	clocking his behavior very carefully.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I had some words all prepared but
		now I've forgotten them - uh - um -
		wait a minute.

	Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the
		tip of my tongue.

			     SUSAN
		It'll come back, Daddy.

			     PARRISH
		Will it?...

	Parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Anyway, I'd like to go on but...

	He hesitates, drifts into silence.

			     ALLISON
			(tentatively)
		Daddy, you could sit down if you
		wanted to.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		There is so much I would like to say
		-- but I can't --
			(another moment)
		So I better sit down.  Carry on,
		everybody.

	He sits, then immediately stands up again.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		One other thing -- why don't we all
		have dinner again tomorrow night?

			     ALLISON
		Dinner?  Again?

			     SUSAN
		Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?

			     PARRISH
			(with great sincerity)
		No.

	The word lands with effect, Susan and Allison have heard it
	well.

			     SUSAN
		We'll be here.

			     QUINCE
		You bet.

			     ALLISON
		With bells on.

	The guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most
	concerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything
	but Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of
	a display, gives her a pro forma hug.  Joe has observed
	every instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable
	when Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a
	roast that has been carved.

			     JOE
			(to Coyle)
		I would prefer some peanut butter.

			     COYLE
		How would you like that, sir?  On
		some kind of toast?

			     JOE
		Toast?  No...just the butter.

			     COYLE
		Right away.

	Coyle heads for the kitchen.

			     SUSAN
		Why do you love peanut butter so
		much?

			     JOE
			(intimately)
		I don't know.

			     SUSAN
		I adore things like that....food I
		can't do without.  Don't you?

	Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the
	room.

			     JOE
		Yes...

			     SUSAN
		It comforts you, doesn't it?

			     JOE
			(captivated)
		Yes...I've found that it does.

			     DREW
		Mind if I throw up?

			     PARRISH
			(admonishing gently)
		Please, Drew.

			     JOE
			(to Susan)
		I'm very concerned about the woman
		you attended to today.

			     SUSAN
		I am, too.

			     JOE
		Has her pain abated?

			     SUSAN
		We're doing what we can for her.
		But it doesn't look good.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

			     DREW
		Who are we talking about?

			     JOE
			(to Susan)
		But I know she's grateful for the
		care you're giving her.

			     DREW
		Is this a state secret or are we
		being excluded just for the fun of
		it?

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Susan's patient is whom we are
		talking about.

			     SUSAN
		Joe visited the hospital today.

	Parrish's head swivels to Joe.

			     ALLISON
		Did he?  That's more than we get to
		do.

			     DREW
		Well, maybe next time Joe goes,
		he'll take us along.

			     JOE
		Perhaps you could remind me.

			     DREW
		I'll make a note of it.  Anything
		else?

			     QUINCE
		I'd like to come, too.  See Susan
		strut her stuff.

			     DREW
		You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination
		Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour
		Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to
		you?

	Silence.  Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects
	a sudden concern with their relationship.

			     JOE
		Susan is a wonderful doctor.

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	After dinner, the family and guests file back in from the
	dining room, Drew alongside Parrish.

			     DREW
		I have to go, Bill -- it's been a
		helluva day.  Need a few minutes to
		sort everything out.

			     PARRISH
		Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

			     DREW
		Sure.

	Drew peels off, heads for the foyer and front door, Susan
	follows him.

	Parrish corners Joe.

			     PARRISH
		Why did you go to the hospital?

			     JOE
		I don't know.

			     PARRISH
		You were just curious?

			     JOE
		I guess...

			     PARRISH
		About Susan?

			     JOE
		I wouldn't put it that way.

			     PARRISH
		What way would you put it?

			     JOE
		You tell me, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		How about you telling me?  When I
		ask a simple question, I expect a
		straight answer.  That's what I'm
		used to.  Anybody who doesn't give
		it to me, I fire.

			     JOE
		Are you going to fire me, Bill?

	Silence, Parrish is at a loss.

	INT. FOYER - NIGHT

	Drew is putting on his coat, Susan with him, a tension between
	them, a heavy silence finally broken.

			     SUSAN
		...See you tomorrow night.

			     DREW
		Include me out.  I've had enough of
		the conversations.

			     SUSAN
		You don't mean that.  You wouldn't
		disappoint Daddy --

			     DREW
		Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got
		Joe.
			(a moment)
		And so do you.

			     SUSAN
		Drew, you're out of line.

			     DREW
		That may be.  But I don't like the
		fucker.  I don't like the way he
		looks at you and talks to you.  And
		vice versa.

			     SUSAN
		Sorry, but I like the way he looks
		and talks to me.  And vice versa.
		Okay?

			     DREW
		No, not okay.  I thought we had a
		good thing going here.
			(a moment)
		It shows you never know.

	Silence, neither knows how to continue.

			     SUSAN
		Well... goodnight.

			     DREW
		Yeah.  Goodnight.

	Drew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer,
	he's been observing them.  She walks up to him.

			     SUSAN
		How long have you been standing
		there?

			     JOE
		I don't like the way Drew spoken to
		you.  But I feel better about it now
		because of the way you spoke back.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Tell me about yourself, Joe.  Who
		you are.  What you're doing with my
		father.

	Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		So you're not going to tell me?

	Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's
	inquiries.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You're married, aren't you?

			     JOE
		Why?

			     SUSAN
		Because guys who never say anything
		about themselves are always married.

	Joe doesn't respond.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		So you are married.

			     JOE
		No, I'm not.

			     SUSAN
		Girlfriend?

			     JOE
		No.

			     SUSAN
		Gay?

			     JOE
		No.

	Susan comes closer to Joe.

			     SUSAN
		Then tell me, Joe, how come a man
		as attractive, intelligent, well-
		spoken ,diffident in the most sed-
		uctive way, and yet powerful, is all
		alone in this world?

	Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted
	by Susan.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I'm sorry, I don't want to pry and
		you don't want to tell me.  So let's
		leave it a mystery.  That's the way
		you want it, isn't it?

	Susan takes another step closer to Joe.

			     JOE
		Thank you, I appreciate that.

	They are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds
	them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the
	stairs.

			     SUSAN
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
			(softly)
		To bed.

			     SUSAN
			(suddenly fragile)
		'To bed'?

			     JOE
		Yes.  I'm tired.

	He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the
	stairs, Susan watches him disappear.

	She turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are
	exiting, "good-byes" all around.  Susan is left alone now
	with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar.

			     PARRISH
		That was wonderful.

			     SUSAN
		Yeah, it's good to get together.

			     PARRISH
		Do you mind if I raise a little
		caution flag?

			     SUSAN
		Raise away.

			     PARRISH
		What is the nature of your interest
		in Joe?

			     SUSAN
		Well, remember how you told me about
		"lightning striking"?  The nature of
		it's in there somewhere.

	Parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his
	time before answering.

			     PARRISH
		I won't say you may be getting onto
		shaken ground --

			     SUSAN
		Then what will you say?

			     PARRISH
		I don't think this is the lightning
		you are looking for.  Drew's a good
		man.  I know I didn't seem to be
		completely in his corner before, but
		I've come to appreciate --

			     SUSAN
		Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo-
		ten?  What's going on?

			     PARRISH
		Nothing.

			     SUSAN
		When you say 'nothing' that way,
		it's not nothing.

			     PARRISH
		Then what is it?

			     SUSAN
		It's something.

	She kisses him.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		G'night, Daddy.  See you tomorrow.
		This is getting interesting.

	She goes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NEXT DAY

	A large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of
	coffee and half-eaten pastries.  The Board of Parrish
	Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince.
	Felicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes.

			     DREW
		...I know you're all as uncomfor-
		table as I am to be meeting without
		Bill, but I got a call last night
		from John Bontecou.  Not only is he
		still interested, he is sweetening
		his offer.
			(a moment)
		Although it pains me to say it, in
		my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
		us peremptorily in dismissing any
		deal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm
		sorry to say that if we are to exam-
		ine this new offer responsibly as
		the Board of Directors of Parrish
		Communications, we must do so with-
		out its Chairman.
			(another moment)
		Oh yes, there is one additional
		element: Bontecou is so anxious to
		get us, he said he'd take Parrish
		Communications with our Chairman or
		without.

	The Board falls silent.  Sloane, a peer of Parrish's,
	fidgets.  Drew milks the moment.

			     DREW (cont'D)
		It's no surprise if I suggest to you
		that the Bill Parrish we know is not
		the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.
		You heard that speech -- some strange
		emotional rationale to buttress a
		knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
		offer.  Does it not strike you that
		something is possibly affecting this
		man's judgement?  More specifically
		-- his judgement to make a critical
		business decision?

	Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.

			     DREW (cont'D)
		It's not pleasant to say the follow-
		ing, but I would be remiss, in this
		crisis, if I did not.  When we pre-
		sent Bill with the improved Bontecou
		offer, and if he refuses to let us
		consider it -- once more makes an
		adamant or emotional rejection -- we
		will have no choice but to seek an
		alternative.

			     SLOANE
		And what would that be?

			     DREW
		Bill's birthday is the day after
		tomorrow.  There is a provisory by-
		law in our charter.  Per the discre-
		tion of the Board, Corporate off-
		icers can be retired at age sixty-
		five.

			     SLOANE
		You're taking this too far, Drew.

			     DREW
		Am I not obligated to?

	Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves
	the room.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		How did this all come about?  Crisis
		-- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-
		pany, crisis for us.  I came about
		with the arrival on the scene of --
		Mr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe
		Black.  He attends our Board meet-
		int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-
		sides in his office.  Never leaves
		his side.  And, in my opinion, is
		always in his ear.  Telling him what
		to do and Bill is listening.  Who is
		Joe Black?  What is his relationship
		to Bill Parrish?  And most important,
		what is behind his influence on our
		Chairman?

			     SLOANE
		You're building this thing up too
		much, Drew.  He's had advisors be-
		fore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.

	The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur-
	prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.

			     DREW
		Thank you for coming.

			     SLOANE
		Hello, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know
		everybody was going to be here, what
		a nice surprise.  What's the big
		confab?

			     SLOANE
			(acidly)
		This is a secret meeting.

			     DREW
			(to Quince)
		I hope you'll respect its nature --
		What we're trying to do here is
		gather our thoughts -- in light of
		Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
		-- and make an appropriate presenta-
		tion to him as to how we think the
		company might proceed.  Won't you
		share with our Board the information
		you gave me last night?

	Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.
	He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
	Board.

			     QUINCE
		Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got
		good news.  As I was telling Drew,
		I've been making a little hay while
		the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
		possibly three new and boiling hot
		prospects for merger.

			     DREW
		How did Bill react to the leads
		you've developed?

			     QUINCE
		He was interested.

			     DREW
			(prompting)
		-- But he was concerned about the
		timing?

			     QUINCE
		The timing -- yes.  He says it's up
		to Joe.

			     DREW
		'It's up to Joe'?

			     QUINCE
		That's what he said.

	Quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly
	around at the Board members.  They are stunned, Sloane in
	shock.  Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words
	sink in.

	INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish, Joe, Susan, Allison and Quince are seated at the
	table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside.
	Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some
	clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet
	again.  Parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks
	over his demi-tasse cup at Joe, Parrish aware of Joe's
	heightened interest in Susan, and Susan's reciprocation.

	Coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with
	cakes on them, Luisa follows with one other.  They set them
	down in front of Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		What is this?

			     ALLISON
		Annie made them.

			     PARRISH
		Who's Annie?

			     ALLISON
		From La Rosette, only the greatest
		pastry chef in America.
			(pointing)
		This is orange, from real Seville
		oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille
		crust, a little on the fanciful.
		And a while, nothing like a good old
		white cake, vanilla, with Angel food
		but some maroons shavings thrown in.

			     PARRISH
		I don't like cake.

			     ALLISON
		It's for the party, Dad --

			     PARRISH
		Oh, the goddam party --

			     ALLISON
		'Goddam party'!

	Allison bursts into tears.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
			(to Quince)
		Did you hear that?

	Quince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite.

			     QUINCE
		This is great, honey.  The orange.
		Has it got a little vodka in it?
		Like that Finnish stuff, orange
		vodka --
			(to Parrish)
		Put your lips around this one, Bill.
		It's out of this world.

			     PARRISH
		No thank you, Quince.
			(to Allison)
		I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at
		this.  Why don't you choose whatever
		cake you like?

			     ALLISON
		I knew you were going to say that.
		Tito Puente.  The old platoon.  Now
		the cake.  You just don't care.  Why
		did I do this?  I should have my head
		examined.  I'm trying to throw the
		party for the century for my father -
		and you know what -- he doesn't give
		a shit.

	She bursts into tears all over again.

			     QUINCE
		But he does give a shit.  Don't you,
		Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Yeah, I give a shit.

			     QUINCE
		See.  There.  What'd I tell you?

	Joe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		Feel better?

			     ALLISON
		Yeah, but --

			     QUINCE
		But what?

			     ALLISON
		What will I tell Annie?

	Parrish forks a bit of a cake.

			     PARRISH
		This one.

			     QUINCE
		The vodka.  What'd I tell you?

	Quince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to
	relax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans-
	pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a
	sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation-
	ship.

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	After dinner, Parrish, Allison and Susan are gathered to-
	gether.  At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe
	watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.

			     JOE
			(to Quince)
		Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth
		leading killer of adult Western
		males.

			     QUINCE
		I didn't know that.

			     JOE
		On the other hand, Winston Churchill
		drank a bottle of cognac a day and
		lived until he was ninety-one.

	After a moment.

			     QUINCE
		You're an original, Joe.  A little
		hard to figure, maybe...

			     JOE
		And you're a nice man, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Thanks.

			     JOE
		You're welcome.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Drew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense
	glance with Susan, then heads straight for Parrish who seems
	surprised to see him.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've
		got a bit of a crisis downtown --
		it's not something we could talk
		about on the phone.

	Parrish takes Drew aside.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The Board's real unhappy, Pappy --
		they felt you dealt with them pre-
		emptorily, you never gave them a
		chance to speak --

			     PARRISH
		What is there to say?  They know
		what John Bontecou is -- and if they
		didn't, they know now.

			     DREW
		Yes, you made your feeling abun-
		dantly clear.  Now they want to do
		the same with theirs.

			     PARRISH
		What are their feelings?

			     DREW
		If I read this Board right now, they
		want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

			     PARRISH
		Over my dead body.

	Parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of
	Joe, Susan, Quince and Allison.

			     DREW
		What do you think the Board is going
		to say when I tell them that?

			     PARRISH
		I don't care.

			     DREW
		With all due respect, you damn well
		better care because if you try to
		stonewall them again, there'll be
		blood on the floor.

	Silence, Parrish carefully calibrating Drew's remark.

			     PARRISH
		Whose?

			     DREW
		Yours.

			     PARRISH
		I'm feeling real uncomfortable right
		now because the guy who reports to
		me is threatening me.

			     DREW
		I'm just giving you the truth.  There
		was a time when William Parrish liked
		the truth.

	Joe, although across the room, is all attention.

			     PARRISH
		I think it's time you went home,
		Drew.

			     DREW
		Certainly.  Goodnight.

	Drew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into
	the hallway.

			     SUSAN
		Drew!

	He stops.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Never talk to my father like that
		again.

			     DREW
		Don't worry about it.  There's a
		beginning and a middle and an end
		to everything.  And I think I've
		come to the end of my chapter with
		the Parrishes.

	Joe has followed them into the hallway.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		And the end began with this guy.

	Drew looks down towards Joe.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Mr. Black --?  We ran a check on you
		and you know what we came up with?

			     JOE
		No, I don't --

			     DREW
		Not good, not bad, you know what we
		got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars,
		no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.

	Joe waits.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		All of a sudden a guy appears on the
		scene with the Chairman of one of
		the greatest communications corpora-
		tions of the world, the boss makes
		him privy to all the company's
		secrets, he attends the Board meet-
		ings, and us working stiffs with
		MBA's up the ass and years and years
		and years of experience, we're left
		outside with our noses pressed
		against the window.

	Joe doesn't respond.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		This is a big-time operation, deal-
		ing in big-time issues, demanding
		big-time executives who make big-
		time decisions.  So, Joe, why don't
		you tell me exactly what it is
		that's big time about you?

	After a moment.

			     JOE
		You first.

			     SUSAN
			(to Drew)
		Why don't you get off his case?

			     DREW
		Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney
		now?  Are we going to go to court?
		Or are we going to go to bed?  And I
		don't mean you and me.  I mean you
		and him.

			     SUSAN
		That's it.  It's over.  Get out.

			     DREW
		So I guess a blowjob's out of the
		question?

	Joe clears his throat.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Did you say something?

	Joe considers him evenly.

			     JOE
		Almost.

			     SUSAN
			(to Drew)
		I said get out.

	Now Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with
	a SLAM.

			     JOE
		What an angry fellow.

	A moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone,
	and Joe does as well.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry about --

			     JOE
		Please.  We don't need to talk about
		Drew.

	She regards Joe.

			     SUSAN
		No.  We don't.

	They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Brave you had a chance to look at
		Dad's rare books?  Jefferson's
		Parliamentary Manual, a first
		edition Bleak House --

	Joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.

			     JOE
		I love your smell.

			     SUSAN
		-- I guess you haven't.

	Now Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's
	neck.  Joe holds himself very still.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I like your smell, too.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

			     SUSAN
		It was everything.

	Silence, the TICKING of the clock.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		When I was little, my mother used to
		say, "Darling, you could set your
		heart by this clock".

			     JOE
		-- Could you?

			     SUSAN
		Never tried, 'til now.
			(suddenly)
		Joe, may I kiss you?

			     JOE
		Why, yes.  Thank you.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		You're welcome.

	Susan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his
	very awkwardness endearing.  Susan pulls him closer, they
	linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Thank you.

			     JOE
		You're welcome.

	The clock TICKS on.  A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's
	face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a
	point of no return.

			     SUSAN
		Joe?

	The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.

			     JOE
		Yes?

			     SUSAN
		I don't know who you are.

			     JOE
		Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're
		Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak
		feeling in my knees --

			     SUSAN
		And is your heart beating strangely?

			     JOE
		Faster.  And I want the scent from
		underneath your ears and the taste
		of your lips and the touch of your
		tongue to stay with me -- forever.

	An intake of breath.  She is about to speak.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		And you don't even have to say a
		word.

	Their faces inches from each other's.

			     SUSAN
		I have to go home.

	But neither Susan nor Joe moves.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Don't I?

	Her question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile.  Susan
	takes the opportunity to step back from him.  The SOUND of
	someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends
	immediately how the situation will appear to him.

			     SUSAN
		Goodnight, Daddy.

	She drifts right past him, exits.  Joe and Parrish are left
	alone now, eyes on each other's.

			     JOE
		Hello, Bill.

			     PARRISH
			(carefully)
		Hello.  Would you like to join me,
		Quince and Allison for a nightcap?

			     JOE
		Um -- not right now.

	An awkward moment.

			     PARRISH
		Okay.  Goodnight.

			     JOE
		Goodnight.

	Parrish turns and exits, Joe's head inclines, he breathes in
	the scent of his collar.

							CUT TO:

	INT. EXECUTIVE SUITE, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - NEXT DAY

	Parrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator,
	is greeted as usual:

			     JENIFER
		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Jennifer.

			     JENIFER
		The Board is waiting.

			     PARRISH
		What?

			     JENIFER
		Didn't you call a Board meeting?

	Jennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she
	knows better than to press the point.

			     JENIFER (cont'd)
		Yes, the members are waiting.  They
		are in the Board room now.

	Jennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker
	of any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room,
	Joe right beside him.

	INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, includ-
	ing Drew, Quince and Sloane.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning.

	An odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the
	same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting,
	its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob-
	lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.

			     DREW
		Did you want to have a cup of coffee
		or something, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		I don't think so.  Do you?

	Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out
	all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		To get to the point, we have re-
		ceived new information from John
		Bontecou concerning his desires for
		this company to merge with his, and
		we wanted to set the details before
		you.

	A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it
	appears he may not ever answer.

			     PARRISH
		That's it?

			     DREW
		Bontecou wants a quick response
		and --

			     PARRISH
		The answer is no, quick enough for
		you?

			     DREW
		Don't you want to hear the details?

			     PARRISH
		I'm not interested in the details.
		And I'm not interested in the big
		picture either.  What I am inter-
		ersted in is how my Board got conven-
		ed behind my back, is entertaining a
		further proposal from a man whom it
		offends me to do business with,
		moreover has the audacity to present
		this to me like a prize fish, and I
		am expected to clap for it like a
		performing seal.  No, thank you.

			     DREW
		So I am to understand from your re-
		sponse that you do not want to hear
		the details of Bontecou's offer?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, you are to understand that, and
		now may I ask you a question?

			     DREW
		Certainly, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Are you running this Board or am I?

	Sloane leans in.

			     SLOANE
		We're not getting anywhere here.
		Why don't we take some of the best
		out of this thing, let's consider
		it coolly, let's take a week --

			     DREW
		Bontecou wants a speedier response
		than that.

			     SLOANE
		He'll wait --

			     PARRISH
		Doesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow,
		a week from now -- 'a week from
		now', who can think about a week
		from now -- the answer is going to
		be the same -- a loud, unmistakable,
		all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.

	A BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence
	under Parrish's withering glance.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		That's it?  I've got a busy day
		and this meeting has already set
		me behind.  Shall we adjourn?

			     DREW
		Before we do, while we're here,
		there is a second question the
		Board would like a response to,
		a far simpler one.

	Parrish waits.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Who is the man sitting to the right
		of you?

	Everybody's eyes are on Joe.

			     PARRISH
		I've already introduced Mr. Black to
		you all.

			     DREW
		But who is he?  What are his creden-
		tials?  What is his relationship to
		you?

	No response from Parrish.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The feeling of the Board is this: we
		fear Mr. Black is not only influenc-
		ing your decisions in regard to this
		company, but that you are relying on
		him to make them for you.

	Quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front
	of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still
	does not answer.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The lack of response, Bill, is not
		appropriate.  We are your Board, we
		have a right to know how you are
		managing the operations of this
		company, and most importantly, that
		you have not delegated someone to do
		it for you.

	Parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does
	not speak.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Okay, one more time.

	Drew regards Joe.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Who is Joe Black?

	Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as
	Quince's head sinks into his hands.

			     DREW (cont'd)
			(to the Board)
		A motion has been brought before
		the Board to invoke Article 19 of
		the corporate charter.

			     PARRISH
		In English, please.

			     DREW
		Mandatory retirement upon our
		Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.

	Parrish is expressionless.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		At which time, the Chairman will be
		named Emeritus, he will be welcome
		to attend all meetings, and will
		serve as International Spokesman for
		the corporation plus, of course, a
		settlement, a golden parachute of
		such magnitude that his feet will
		never touch the ground.

	Drew pauses.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Please indicate your vote by a "Yes"
		or "No".

	A "Yes" is heard, now another "Yes", now more "Yes"es, all
	reluctant, "No" from Sloane, "No" from Quince who realizes
	he is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The motion is passed.  We will of
		course delay the announcement, out
		of respect for our former Chairman,
		until after the celebration of his
		birthday this weekend.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you for allowing me to save
		face, Drew.

	Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew.

			     DREW
			(to the Board)
		The other motion before us is the
		acceptance of John Bontecou's offer
		to merge this corporation with
		Bontecou International --

	Parrish stands, Drew stops speaking.

			     PARRISH
		Joe?

	Silence, then Joe rises.

			     JOE
			(to the Board)
		Who I am, and my relationship to
		Bill, will be divulged in our own
		good time.

	Joe follows Parrish out of the room.

	INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Sloane has pursued Parrish and Joe.

			     SLOANE
			(to Parrish)
		...It's not over, 'til it's over.

			     PARRISH
		Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"
		shit.

			     SLOANE
		I still sense some doubt in this
		group, we could turn it around.
		You'll be up in the country?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, the big 'celebration' of my
		mandatory retirement birthday.
		You're an honored guest, Eddie.

			     SLOANE
		I'm going to stick it out here.  We
		still have a shot.

	The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the
	door closes, leaving Sloane behind.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have
	lingered, exchanging post-mortems.  And enraged Quince has
	cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others.

			     QUINCE
		What have you done?  You've gotten
		the old man fired!

			     DREW
		That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was
		wobbling, mind you, but you stupid
		the coup de grace.

	Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality.

			     QUINCE
		I'm going to put a stop to this!

			     DREW
		Quince, you can't unscramble
		scrambled eggs.

			     QUINCE
		But I didn't mean to do it!

			     DREW
		The train's left the station, pal,
		and you're aboard.  Would you like
		to hear the silver lining?  Check
		that, gold.  I've been working with
		John Bontecou all along.  We had
		a game plan -- acquire Parrish
		Communications then break it apart
		and peddle it piece-by-piece to the
		highest bidder.  I set it up for
		him, he smacks it out of the park.

	Quince is struck dumb.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Don't you know what this'll mean?
		You'll be rich.  You'll sell your
		stock, you can stop kissing ass --
		What'll it feel like to be a man?

			     QUINCE
		I don't want to get rich this way --
		I'm going to expose you.

			     DREW
		Go right ahead.  Tell William
		Parrish how you betrayed him at
		a secret Board meeting.  And tell
		Allison how you got her father
		fired -- and he lost his company.

	Quince goes ashen.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		It's just life, Quin-cee.

	Drew hails an employee across the hall.

			     DREW (cont'd)
			(to Quince)
		Wake up and smell the thorns.

	Drew joins the employee as Quince slumps against the wall.

	INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

	Parrish enters, Joe right behind him, Coyle takes their coats,
	disappears.  Parrish hesitates for a moment, shrugs as if he
	has a thought he doesn't want to share, then heads upstairs
	with Joe.  He is trudging a bit, Joe senses his mood.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		That's okay.

			     JOE
		What's okay?

			     PARRISH
		Just a manner of speaking.

	Joe seems puzzled.

			     PARRISH
			(cont'd)
		What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's
		over.  We've got bigger fish to fry,
		don't we, Joe?

			     JOE
		'Fish'?

			     PARRISH
		Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going
		to take a nap.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  Coyle will have
		Luisa fix you something to eat.

			     JOE
		I'm not hungry.

			     PARRISH
		Then I can't help you.

	Parrish turns into his bedroom, closing the door gently
	behind him.  Joe continues down the hall, enters the guest
	wing.

	INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

	Midday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes
	through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels
	the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises
	again, crosses back to the sitting room.

	Susan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns
	around.

			     SUSAN
		You're here?

			     JOE
		I am.

	He stands, they regard each other for the moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		May I take your coat?

	She doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, Joe
	comes around her to help, Susan senses him breathing in the
	scent at the back of her neck.

			     SUSAN
		I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge
		a little lunch, I was in the neigh-
		borhood --

			     JOE
		How beautiful.

	He starts to hang Susan's coat up.

			     SUSAN
		Just throw it on the chair.

	Joe holds her coat carefully on the chair.  An awkward
	moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		When I called, they said that you
		and Daddy had just left the office.

			     JOE
		He's taking a nap.

			     SUSAN
		He must be tired -- this Bontecou
		thing --

			     JOE
		Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You must be hungry?

	Susan sits on the couch.

			     SUSAN
		No, not anymore.  Are you?

	Joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the
	couch beside her.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		(after a moment)
		Are you cold?

			     JOE
		...No.

			     SUSAN
		Maybe it's the draft through the
		door.

	She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to
	Joe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each
	other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
	as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but
	has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are
	instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-
	gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This
	excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
	very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other
	are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-
	ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions
	are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
	before.

	Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-
	ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
	ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
	Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land
	of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet
	at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being
	lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but
	is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing
	is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.
	The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in
	the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
	journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events
	they have created; and they don't care about the consequences.

	Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:

			     SUSAN
		It's so wonderful to make love to
		you.  It's like making love to some-
		one who has never made love before.

	Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has
	said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself.
	He weighs, then resists, the impulse.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

	Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his
	comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.

			     SUSAN
		Did you like making love to me?

			     JOE
		I loved it.

			     SUSAN
		More than you love peanut butter?

			     JOE
		Yes!

	She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers.

	Joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for
	the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone
	to some distant, distant land.

			     SUSAN
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
		Nowhere?  I'm...here.

			     SUSAN
		For how long?

			     JOE
		Oh, I hope a long, long time.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Me, too.

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		What do we do now?

	She smiles.

			     SUSAN
		It will come to us.

	INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE (LATER) - DAY

	Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her
	on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss.  The kiss
	lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back
	longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door
	softly after her.

	He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the
	balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan.

			     JOE
		Hello, Bill.

	Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Did you have a nice nap?

			     PARRISH
		I couldn't sleep.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

	He starts up the stairs.

			     PARRISH
		No, I'll come down

	Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish
	descends.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		What's going on?

	Joe senses Parrish's tone, doesn't answer.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I saw you kiss Susan.

			     JOE
		Yes, I saw you see me.

			     PARRISH
		Well, you're at the wrong place at
		the wrong time with the wrong woman.

			     JOE
		I'll be the judge of that.

			     PARRISH
		I'm her father!

			     JOE
		With all due respect, Bill, I'm not
		asking your permission.

			     PARRISH
		Well, you goddam well should.  You
		walk into my life, give me the worst
		news a guy can get, have me dancing
		on the heads of pins with my busi-
		ness and with my family, and now
		you're spooning with my daughter.

			     JOE
		'Spooning'?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, and stop repeating everything I
		sai, and turning it into a question.
		Spooning, fooling around, God knows
		what.  You arrive on the scene -- why
		you picked me, I still don't under-
		stand --

			     JOE
		I picked you for your verve, your
		excellence, and for your ability to
		- how shall I say - instruct.  You've
		lived a first-rate life.  And I find
		it eminently usable.

	Parrish measures Joe.

			     PARRISH
		What do you want?

	Joe doesn't answer, riveted now on Parrish.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Everybody wants something, Joe.
		You've been taking me from pillar
		to post here.  I thought I knew who
		you were, and it wasn't a whole lot
		of fun, however it was almost bear-
		able.  Now I'm getting something
		else from you, something very, very
		strange -- what is it that you want,
		Joe?

			     JOE
		I'm only following the Parrish
		bywords.  Looking for that 'ounce
		of excitement', that 'whisper of a
		thrill' -- What there is no sense
		living your life without.  You know
		what I mean, Bill.

	Parrish's jaw sets.

			     PARRISH
		You're violating the laws of the
		universe.

			     JOE
		This universe?

			     PARRISH
		Any universe that exists or ever
		existed.  You may be the pro, Joe.
		But I know who you are.  And you're
		all fucked up.

			     JOE
		I don't like your tone, and I don't
		like your references.

			     PARRISH
		And I don't give a shit.

			     JOE
		May I remind you this is not just a
		dispute with a putative suitor, this
		is me.  So watch it...Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you
		sonofabitch.

			     JOE
		I told you, 'watch it'.

	Silence.  Now Joe turns on his heel, heads right out the
	front door.  Parrish is left solitary, confounded, staring
	at the closed door.

	INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

	Joe walks down a hallway, a bouquet of flowers in hand,
	looks around the usual feverish activity, he seems lost for
	the moment, but a Receptionist catches his eye.

			     RECEPTIONIST
		Can I help you?

			     JOE
		Dr. Parrish.

			     RECEPTIONIST
		She comes on at 6.

			     JOE
		Oh.

	He looks at the flowers, regards them for a moment, then
	heads for an elevator.

	INT. EASTER'S ROOM, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

	Easter is sitting up in bed, hooked up to an TV and moni-
	tors.  She glances over at the doorway, Joe is standing
	there, observing her.  An awkward silence, he looks at
	his flowers again, now sets them respectfully on Easter's
	bedstand.

			     EASTER
		Mistah Bad News.  'Bout time you
		show up.

	Joe speaks to her in the dialect.

			     JOE
		Don' be facety, woman.

			     EASTER
		None facety, mistah.  You come for
		me?  Dat's good news.

			     JOE
		No, I come to see Doctor.

			     EASTER
		Doctor?  What could be wrong wit'
		you?

			     JOE
		Nuthin'.

	Silence, then Easter smiles.

			     EASTER
		Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     EASTER
		My Doctor Lady?

			     JOE
		Mine, too.

	She thinks about this for the moment, Joe grows uncomfort-
	able.

			     EASTER
		You in love?

	Joe seems slightly tormented by the question, Easter senses
	him trying to frame a respect.

			     JOE
		Yah.

			     EASTER
		You loved back?

			     JOE
			I am.

			     EASTER
		She knows you real self?

			     JOE
		She knows how she feel.

			     EASTER
			(scoffing)
		Rass!

			     JOE
			(irritably)
		Don' need you okayin'.

			     EASTER
		Schoolboy tings is you head.
		Badness for you, badness for her,
		badness for me, lyin' here tumor,
		big as breadfruit, poison my inners
		an' waiting.

			     JOE
		Brung you flowers and all I gettin's
		facety back.

			     EASTER
			(stubbornly)
		Only flowers I wan' see's one's
		over my peaceful self restin' in
		the dutty.

			     JOE
		Can do no right by people.  Come to
		take, you wan' to stay, leave you
		stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!

	Silence, Easter waits, watching Joe.

			     EASTER
		You not in you right place, mistah.

	Easter's response stops Joe cold, he looks away and then
	back at her, she had clearly reached him.

			     EASTER (cont'd)
		I ain' either.  No more.  You come
		wi' me now.  Take me.

			     JOE
		But I not lonely here.  Somebody
		want me here.

	Easter considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically.

			     EASTER
		It nice it happen to you.  It like
		you came to Cat Island and you had
		a holiday, sun didn't burn you red,
		just brown, sleep no mosquito eat
		you, rum no poung you head nex' day.
		But trut' is, dat bound to happen,
		you stay long enough.  So tak dat
		nice picture home wi' you, but don'
		be fooled.  We lonely here mostly,
		too.  If we lucky, we got some nice
		pictures.

	Easter drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense
	they understand each other.  Easter shifts, trying hard to
	ease her discomfort.

			     JOE
			(gently)
		Got enough nice pictured, Easter.

	She looks at him and nods gratefully and closes her eyes.
	Joe watches her, now his eyes close.  Easter exhales
	raspingly, falls still.  The monitors flatline.  A beeping
	alarm sound somewhere down the hall.

	Joe opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, he seems troubled.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		G'bye, sistah.

	She slips out of the room.

	INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Parrish is playing solitaire.  The SOUND of the front door
	closing, HEELS crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer
	door is Susan.

			     PARRISH
		Hello, honey.

	He starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks
	around now.

			     SUSAN
		Where's Joe?

			     PARRISH
		Joe?

	A silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Joe's not around.

			     SUSAN
		Where is he?

			     PARRISH
		I don't know.

	Susan seems distracted.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Why are you looking for Joe?

			     SUSAN
		Because I was sitting in a staff
		meeting, incredibly bored, my mind
		kept wandering and the only place it
		landed was -- Joe.

			     PARRISH
		I don't understand.

			     SUSAN
		Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all
		those things you told me to wait
		for.  Well, they've arrived.

	Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards.

			     PARRISH
		This is crazy --

			     SUSAN
		Why?  A man appears at your side,
		almost never leaves it, you clearly
		trust him, depend on him, I sense
		you value him deeply, why aren't
		those things good enough for me?

			     PARRISH
		You don't know anything about Joe --

			     SUSAN
		What are you afraid of, Dad?  That
		I'll fall head over heels for Joe --
		well, I have -- as you did with Mom.
			(a moment)
		That's always been standard,
		whether you like or not.

	Parrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now.

			     PARRISH
		Susan, I don't think Joe is going to
		be with us long.

			     SUSAN
		Where's he going?

			     PARRISH
		I don't know, I can't say --

			     SUSAN
		C'mon!  The guy's working with you.
		You always know chapter and verse
		about everyone who works --

			     PARRISH
		In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I
		just can't help you.  I only would
		tell you -- that with Joe, you are
		on very, very dangerous ground.

	Susan doesn't answer for a moment.

			     SUSAN
		I love him.

			     PARRISH
		I don't care if you love him!  I'm
		telling you he's no good for you!

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Of course not, Daddy.  I'm sorry.

	There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a
	word has sunk in.  Parrish slumps.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I love you, too.

	She kisses Parrish, rearranges one of his ranks of cards,
	shuffles through the deck, turns over the top card, lays
	down a card Parrish needs.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Lightning does strike.

	Parrish watches as Susan turns, disappears out the door.

	EXT. THIRD AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - TWILIGHT

	Joe walking disconcertedly up the street, bumping shoulders
	with the rush hour crowd, trapped in the life of the city,
	he peers intently at faces, cars, into store windows.  He
	stops now at the window of a Korean grocery, something has
	caught his eye, he steps inside.

	Through the window, Joe can be seen making a purchase, he
	hands the Korean Clerk some money, walks out.

	Joe, back on the street now, unscrews the top of a jar of
	peanut butter, dips a wad out with his fingers.  The Korean
	Clerk runs out after him.

			     CLERK
		Change!  Change!

	Joe stops, uncomprehending.  The Clerk hands Joe bills and
	coins.

			     JOE
		Why are you giving me money?

			     CLERK
		Change.

			     JOE
		I am who I am.  I cannot change.

	Joe tries to hand the money back, but the baffled Clerk
	refuses it.

			     CLERK
		You change!

			     JOE
		That's impossible.  You're wasting
		your money.  I couldn't change even
		if I wanted to.

	The Clerk, exasperated, murmurs something in his language
	and returns to the store.  Joe continues on down the street.

	INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish is sitting in a wing chair staring at the fire.  Joe
	appears in the doorway, Parrish doesn't notice him.  Joe
	waits, finally Parrish looks up.  They regard each other.
	Silence.

			     JOE
		Uh --

			     PARRISH
		Yes?

			     JOE
		-- I have the feeling that, all in
		all, what I made this voyage for --
		has served its purpose.

			     PARRISH
		What are you saying, that it's time
		to go?

	Joe doesn't respond, Parrish and Joe measure each other for
	the moment.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I'm ready.

			     JOE
		You are?

			     PARRISH
		Yeah.

			     JOE
		Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.

	Parrish nods, Joe nods back.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELICOPTER POV, HUDSON VALLEY - AFTERNOON

	A bird's eye view of the Hudson, over the George Washington
	Bridge, past the widest expanse of the river at the Tappan
	Zee, coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of
	the Upper Hudson Valley, down towards Annadale-on-Hudson
	and the Parrish country estate, which commands a beehive of
	activity, tents and workmen and vehicles.

	EXT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area.
	The Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and
	Joe disembark.  Following the Butler, they make their way
	through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for
	music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists
	leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.  Parrish
	and Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking
	to one another.  Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder,
	there is a distance between them.  They walk on past chan-
	deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven
	through their branches.  Adding to the confusion, the AStar
	lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling
	from the blast of the rotors.  May, the housekeeper, appears.

			     MAY
			(to Parrish)
		Telephone call, sir.  Mr. Sloane
		from New York.

	Parrish nods, starts up for a wing off the main house, Joe
	right at his side.  Parrish stops.

			     PARRISH
		Excuse me.

	Joe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates,
	and Parrish strides away.  Joe does not follow.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	A low-slung but well-appointed room with a writing table, a
	working fireplace, expensive and appropriate Hudson Valley
	prints.

	Parrish enters, clicks on the SPEAKERPHONE, observes the
	party activity through a wide, bow window.

			     PARRISH
		Eddie?

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?

			     PARRISH
		Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why
		are you still down here?

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		The Board's working through the
		weekend, trying up the loose ends
		this damn thing.  But I want to give
		it one more try, I'm still holding
		out some hope.

			     PARRISH
		Eddie, hold out all the hope you
		want but, I promise you, it's hope-
		less, it's over.  Come on up, let's
		get drunk, if I had your shoulder
		to lean on I might actually enjoy
		this --

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		No, I'm going to stay down here,
		keep my finger in the dike and maybe
		by Monday, the waters could recede.

			     PARRISH
		If you're trying to show me lay-
		down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty,
		forget it.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your
		cake, blow out the candles and make
		a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?

			     PARRISH
		Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for
		the memory.

	Parrish clicks off the SPEAKERPHONE, turns around and looks
	out the window again, the party preparations in full swing,
	colored lights are tested, they flicker on and off.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	Allison is everywhere, Parrish emerges from his wing, she
	catches his eye immediately, the calm director of a DeMille-
	like epic, politely giving workers instructions, making
	lightning decisions.

	Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain
	encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-
	Cyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men
	carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each
	letter.  A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected
	lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.

			     ALLISON
		Hi, Daddy, what do you think?

			     PARRISH
		It's starting to grow on me.  But
		what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?

			     ALLISON
		The fountain is the Caspian Sea and
		the Sea is serving up caviar.  The
		'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for
		Petrossian.  Of course, they also
		stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.

			     PARRISH
		Do they, m'dear?

			     ALLISON
		-- Plus we've got a baritone with a
		balalaika coming from The Russian
		Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a
		Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson
		Eddy songs.

	Parrish shakes his head.

			     PARRISH
		You are amazing.  Why, oh why,
		Allison, are you doing all this?

	But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's
	sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions
	out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away
	now, daughter and father, alone.

			     ALLISON
		I do it because I love you.  Because
		everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher-
		ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the
		people who work for you, everybody
		who's ever known you.

			     PARRISH
		Yeah?  And what about my enemies?

			     ALLISON
		They respect you.  Isn't that a kind
		of love?

	Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's
	forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he
	blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		Above all, you've been a wonderful
		father.

			     PARRISH
		I haven't been the father to you
		that --

			     ALLISON
		That you've been to Susan?

			     PARRISH
		I wasn't going to say --

			     ALLISON
		But that's what you were thinking.
		And that's okay.  Because I know you
		love me.  Not like it is with Susan,
		the way your eyes light up when she
		comes in the room and the way she
		always gets a laugh out of you, as
		opposed to me when I walk in a room
		and that look comes over your face,
		"What does she want now?"

	A weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th
	Infantry Regiment  "C" (Charlie) Company.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		I already feel I've had everything I
		could have wanted for my birthday --

			     PARRISH
		Hey, there's lots to come.
			(gesturing to me
			 activity)
		A little excess -- like you love.

	The preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate
	plans coming to fruition.

			     PARRISH
		You know, darling, this is going to
		be a wonderful party.

			     ALLISON
			(gently)
		Yes, it is.

	Allison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her
	go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her.

	EXT. WINE BAR, LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	Ambrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check
	of the bar's stock, Quince ambles up, in the background the
	activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni-
	forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust.

			     QUINCE
		Give me a Seagrams and '7'.

	Ambrose looks at him blankly.

			     QUICNCE (cont'd)
		No got?  Okay a double V.O., water
		back.

			     AMBROSE
		I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr.
		Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Okay, give me a bottle of wine.

			     AMBROSE
		Red or white?

			     QUINCE
		Both.

	Joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting
	up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his
	traps past on a little cart.  Joe doesn't seem to know where
	he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this
	oasis.  Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
			(to Joe)
		Red or white?

			     JOE
		No, thank you.

	Quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of
	each into one glass.

			     QUINCE
		C'mon, have a drink.  You look like
		you need one bad as me.

			     JOE
		Do I?  I'm a little confused.

			     QUINCE
		Confused, huh?  About what?

			     JOE
		Love.

			     QUINCE
		'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles
		of my own.

			     JOE
		You love Allison, don't you?

			     QUINCE
		Oh yes, I do.

			     JOE
		How did you meet?

			     QUINCE
		I was a world-class loser and she
		was a happy, little rich girl --
		and for some reason she took me in.

			     JOE
		But she loves you?

	Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		How do you know?

			     QUINCE
		Because there's nothing we don't
		know about each other and it's okay.
		I mean the deeper, darkest secrets
		-- they don't matter.

			     JOE
		'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah, it's like you know every inch
		of each other's souls -- and then
		you're free.

			     JOE
		What do you mean 'free'?

			     QUINCE
		Free to love each other.  Com-
		pletely.  Totally.  No fear.

	Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		All that hoopla up there reminds me
		how I will never measure up to a man
		like Bill Parrish - or his daughter.

	He drains his wine.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		Do you like me, Joe?

			     JOE
		Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.

			     QUINCE
		What would you say if you knew
		it was me who brought down Bill
		Parrish?
			(a moment)
		I told Drew and the Board that Bill
		depended on you.  Drew led me on,
		but I had no business telling him
		in the first place.  He was setting
		up Bill from day one.  Drew and
		Bontecou are going to chop up the
		company and sell it off for parts.
		Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr.
		Inside.  And I was the fool who made
		it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?

	Joe regards Quince.

			     JOE
		Go to Bill Parrish and tell him
		everything.  He'll forgive you.

	Quince drains one more glass of wine.

			     QUINCE
		You think so?  How do you know?

			     JOE
		Because that's the kind of man Bill
		Parrish is.

	A moment.

			     QUINCE
		Well, maybe... I guess you know him
		better than anybody.

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		-- Getting to.

	The orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks,
	getting close.

			     QUINCE
		Do you think I should wait to tell
		him 'till after the party?

			     JOE
		No.

	Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully.  They look on
	as the pre-party activities swirl on around them.

	EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET (LATER)

	The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes,
	a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house,
	being directed into adjacent fields.  Susan cuts past a re-
	ceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house
	and heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in
	the rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the
	event on which the curtain is just about to rise.

	EXT. LAWN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

	Guests milling, emerging from the crowd Susan sees, isolated
	by a fountain, Joe.  He looks up towards her, he knows she
	has seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been
	prearranged but which they intuit.  Susan slants through the
	guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha-
	tter float on the wind, "He, Susie!",  "What a party",  "You
	look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.

	Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful,
	unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is
	not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.

	EXT. GARDEN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

	The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse
	of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the
	garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in
	front of them.

			     SUSAN
		I like you in a black tie.

			     JOE
		I love you in an evening gown.

			     SUSAN
		It beats a surgical, doesn't it?

	He smiles.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Daddy told me you might be leaving?

			     JOE
		Yes.  Your father and I, our time
		together has come to an end.

			     SUSAN
		Where are you going?

	Joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You won't tell me?

			     JOE
		Well -- I --

			     SUSAN
		And you can't tell me who you are.

	Again the same indescribable gesture from Joe.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I'm in love with a man, I don't know
		who he is, where he's going or when.

			     JOE
		I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.

			     SUSAN
		It gets worse.

			     JOE
		No worse than it gets for me.  I'm
		in love with a woman whom I don't
		want to leave.

			     SUSAN
		Then don't.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		We know so little about each
		other --

			     SUSAN
		We know all that we need to know --

			     JOE
		But there's so much to tell you --

			     SUSAN
		Don't.  That will come later.

			     JOE
		Will it?

			     SUSAN
		Lightning struck.  We caught it in
		a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want
		to be with you, Joe --

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		What will we do?

			     SUSAN
		'Love will find out the way'.

			     JOE
		'Love will find out the way'?

			     SUSAN
		It's a saying.

			     JOE
		I believe that, don't you?

			     SUSAN
		Yes, that's why I said it.

	They are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make
	some declaration when Allison is heard --

			     ALLISON (O.S.)
		There you are!

	Allison appears.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		What's going on here?  Tete-a-tetes
		on my big night?
			(to Susan)
		C'mon honey, you're needed.
			(to Joe)
		Can it wait?

	But before he can answer --

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		Glad to hear it!
			(to Susan)
		Let's go.

	She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall,
	watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up'
	dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.  The
	curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Quince is "on the carpet", sweating through a confession,
	Parrish moroses but  philosophical at his desk.

			     QUINCE
		...what can I say after I say that
		I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've
		zagged, I opened my big mouth one
		too many times, everything got all
		twisted --

			     PARRISH
		It's okay, Quince.  I understand.
		You've always meant well and I
		appreciate that.  Sometimes things
		just turn out -- wrong.

	A KNOCK on the door, it opens, Joe appears.

			     JOE
		Excuse me --

	He starts to step out.

			     QUINCE
		Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you
		-- okay, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Sure.

	As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him.

			     QUINCE
			(to Parrish)
		Joe knew the whole story.  I told
		him.  It was his idea that I come
		clean.  I mean I wanted to come
		clean but he gave me a pair of
		balls, you know what I mean?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, I believe I do.

	Quince now drifts off.

			QUICHE
		Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys
		got business --

			     PARRISH
		No, I'm out of business, right,
		Quince?  However I do have some
		unfinished business -- with Drew.
		Get him out here.  Get him on the
		chopper and get him out here to-
		night.  I want to tell this guy
		how I feel about him face-to-face.

			     QUINCE
		Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P.
		I doubt that Drew's anxious to see
		you face-to-face.

	Joe steps in.

			     JOE
			(to Quince)
		Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges
		that this was a contest and he's
		lost.  The race is to the swift,
		but could Drew summon a modicum
		of understanding and allow Bill to
		save face.  Tell him Bill wants it
		understood in the business community
		he has merely moved upstairs in his
		own company, and the executive
		continuity is unbroken.  Tonight's
		the night to do it.  He'll introduce
		Drew to his press friends as well as
		some of his close acquaintances from
		Washington and Drew can tell them
		that everything's sailing along just
		fine.

	Parrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging
	admiration.  He nods to Joe, summarizes:

			     PARRISH
			(to Quince)
		All in all, what Bill wants to do is
		build the golden bridge to Drew with
		no hard feelings.

			     QUINCE
		You think Drew will go for it?

			     PARRISH
		Quince, I've got confidence in you.

			     QUINCE
		Sir, I'll deliver the package.

	He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent.

			     PARRISH
		Thanks.

			     JOE
		Not at all.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		How are you doing?

			     PARRISH
		What the hell do you care?

			     JOE
		I was just asking, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		You 'want to know', I'll tell you.
		You're looking at a man who tonight
		is not about to walk through the
		Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's
		galloping into it.  And the same time,
		the business he built with his own
		hands and his own head is being
		commandeered by a couple of cheap
		pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost
		forgot, my daughter's fallen in
		love with Death.

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		-- And I'm in love with your
		daughter.

			     PARRISH
		Say again?

			     JOE
		I'm in love with your daughter, and
		I'm taking her with me tonight.

	Parrish is stunned.

			     PARRISH
		You're what?

			     JOE
		I think you heard me, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		You're not taking Susan anywhere.
		And what the hell does that mean
		anyway?

	Joe doesn't answer for a moment.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I thought we had a deal.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		Susan is my daughter, she has a
		wonderful life ahead of her and
		you're going to deprive her of
		it and you're telling me you're
		sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology
		not accepted.

			     JOE
		I love her, Bill.  She is all that
		I ever wanted, and I've never wanted
		for anything because I've never
		wanted anything before, if you can
		understand.

			     PARRISH
		How perfect for you -- to take
		whatever you want because it
		pleases you.  It's not love --

			     JOE
		Then what is it?

			     PARRISH
		Some aimless infatuation in which,
		for the moment, you feel like in-
		dulging.  It's missing everything
		that matters.

			     JOE
		Which is what?

			     PARRISH
		Trust, responsibility, taking the
		weight, for your choices and feel-
		ings and spending the rest of your
		life living up to them.  And above
		all, not hurting the object of your
		love.

			     JOE
		So that's what love is?

			     PARRISH
		Multiply it by infinity and take it
		to the death of forever and you will
		still have barely a glimpse of what
		I am talking about.

			     JOE
		Those were my words, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Well, they're mine now.

	Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.

			     JOE
		Susan wants to come.  She says she's
		in love with me.

			     PARRISH
		With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you
		tell her who you are?

			     JOE
		No.

			     PARRISH
		Does she know where she's going?

	Joe doesn't answer.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Susan went, in whatever way she did,
		for that poor sonofabitch whose body
		you took, and everything else since
		has been aftermath.  You say you love
		her but you don't know what love is.
		She 'loves' you but she doesn't know
		who you are.  You make a deal, you're
		breaking it -- the bottom line is,
		Joe, you're conducting a Great
		Romance under false pretenses.

			     JOE
		I don't like what you're saying.

			     PARRISH
		I don't expect you to.

			     JOE
		Are you threatening me?

			     PARRISH
		I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan
		from the moment she was born, and I
		love her now, and every minute in
		between, and what I dream of is a
		man who will discover her and she
		will discover a man who will love
		her, who is worthy of her, who is of
		this world, of this time and has the
		grace and compassion and fortitude
		to walk beside her as she makes her
		way through this beautiful thing
		called life.

	Parrish is beginning to reach Joe.

			     JOE
		Are you telling me I can't be
		part of it?

	A pause, Parrish's posture changes.

			     PARRISH
		Why did you come in here and tell
		me, Joe?  You are the Biggest Shot
		of all, you don't have to ask my
		permission, but that's what you're
		doing.  You know why?  Because you've
		somewhere, somehow, developed into a
		good guy, and you know this is all
		wrong... I don't know what you're
		going to do -- how can this be love?
		She doesn't know who you are.  Why
		don't you tell her?  Try it out on
		her?  See what happens.  Reveal
		everything there is to know about
		yourself and let the chips fall
		where they may.

	Joe has received what Parrish has said.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Okay? -- I've given it my best shot.
		I wish I could tell you to sleep on
		it but...

	Parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, Joe
	regards him.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a
	weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself
	until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the
	party.  He drifts into the center and runs right into Susan,
	couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety.

			     SUSAN
		Hello, Joe.  What'd you know?

	She smiles.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		There's something so indescribably
		sexy about you in a crowd.  I could
		make love to you right here.

	He hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		If you're going to tell my future,
		you're on the wrong side.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		There is something I do want to tell
		you --

	He stammers into silence.

			     SUSAN
		But you can't.

	Joe is about to respond but doesn't.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Just then -- when you hesitated --
		the way you shift from foot-to-foot,
		I've always found endearing but just
		now -- I got a chill.

	But he drifts again, now she takes his hand.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Remember that morning in the coffee
		shop?  You said 'What's wrong with
		taking care of a woman, she takes
		care of you --"

			     JOE
		Did I say that?

			     SUSAN
		And I said you'd have a hard time
		finding a woman like that.

	Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Well, you've found one, Joe.

			     JOE
		The 'coffee shop' --

			     SUSAN
		-- That was the place... and you were
		the guy.

	Joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		And you said you didn't want me to
		be your doctor because you didn't
		want me to examine you --?
			(a moment)
		Well, I got to examine you after
		all --

	Joe blinks, at a loss.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I could come with you --

			     JOE
		I - uh --

			     SUSAN
		You want me to wait for you, you'll
		be back --

	Joe doesn't answer, Susan is suddenly anxious.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Why do I want this night to last
		forever?

			     JOE
		Don't you know, that's what I want
		more than anything.

	He touches her face.

			     SUSAN
		You said before you couldn't tell me
		who or where, only the 'when' -- Is
		when now?

	A moment.

			     JOE
		May I kiss you?

	She waits.  He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.

			     SUSAN
		That felt like a goodbye.

	Joe's silence is heavy.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		What's going on, Joe?  I feel like
		we're lifting off --

			     JOE
		I'm still here.

			     SUSAN
		But you're not.  You're somewhere
		else.
			(a moment)
		You're someone else --

	Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he
	drifts into a long silence.  Susan is beside herself, her
	emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her.

			     SUSAN
		Tell me you love me -- tell me
		you love me now --

			     JOE
		I love you now, I'll love you
		always --

			     SUSAN
		Hold me --

	He holds on tight to her.  They are desperately entwined
	until finally she releases him.

			     JOE
		Susan --

			     SUSAN
		-- Yes?

			     JOE
		Thank you for loving me.

	She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party
	flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted,
	the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.

	Joe enters, Parrish looks up.

			     JOE
		...We should think about getting
		started, Bill.

	Parrish waits.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		It'll just be us.

	The tension in Parrish's body releases, he takes a breath.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you.

	Joe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain.
	Parrish regards him sympathetically.

	The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door.  Parrish, out
	of politeness to Joe, does not respond.

			     QUINCE (O.S.)
		Bill --?

	After a moment.

			     PARRISH
		Come in.

	Quince appears, flushed with excitement.

			     QUINCE
		-- I got him.  The chopper's two
		minutes away.

	Parrish weighs the information for a moment.

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		How are we on time?

	Joe shrugs, nods gently.

			     JOE
		Okay.

			     PARRISH
			(to Quince)
		Get him in here.

	Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker-
	phone.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		...May? -- I know you're busy,  but I
		want you to put in a call to Eddie
		Sloane for me --

			     MAY (O.S.)
		At home, sir --?

			     PARRISH
		No, he's at the office.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	An area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades
	stop spinning.  Quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens
	it and Drew steps out.  Quince leads the way through the
	lights and MUSIC.  Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for
	himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the
	irony.

			     DREW
		This is damn big of Bill, I also
		think it's smart.

			     QUINCE
		He had no choice.  You're a
		formidable adversary.

			     DREW
		He said that?

			     QUINCE
		Well, you've got him by the short-
		hairs.

			     DREW
		Yeah, the short, gray hairs.

	He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen
	acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		We're all here, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		I appreciate this, Eddie, members
		of the Board, this will just take a
		minute of your time.  As the custo-
		dians of the company, you may re-
		ceive information from what follows
		that is valuable to you --
			(a moment)
		-- or not.  Either way, thanks.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		We're all ears.

	Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and
	closes the door behind him.

			     DREW
		Hi, Bill, happy birthday --

	A moment.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		I just wanted to say how appre-
		ciative I am of this - uh - grand
		gesture and --

			     PARRISH
		Shut up and sit down.

	Drew takes a seat.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You're a worthless sack of shit, you
		fucked me over, played footsie with
		John Bontecou, sold my company out
		to line your own pockets.

			     DREW
		I don't know where you get that idea
		-- the Board agreed --

			     PARRISH
		The Board didn't know you're a mole
		who burrowed inside so you could bury
		us all.

			     DREW
		Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another
		one of his whoppers?  Aren't you
		sick of this asshole lurking around?
		No one knows who he is, but one
		thing everyone does know, he somehow
		got your ear and has been pouring
		poison into it ever since.

	Joe can no longer control himself.

			     JOE
		You're the poison, Drew.  You've
		operated behind-the-scenes to suborn
		the trust of a man who has stamped
		you with his imprimatur of class and
		elegance and stature.  I've seen all
		kinds and degrees of deception in my
		time, but Bill Parrish has been on
		the receiving end of machinations so
		Machiavellian that it has rarely
		been my experience to encounter.  And
		yet he has combatted them stoically,
		and selflessly, without revealing my
		identity.  Had he violated the vow
		of secrecy he took, his task would
		have been far easier, he could have
		turned defeat into victory, but he
		is too honorable a man to have done
		that.  And now I must release him
		from that vow.  Because of me, he
		has lost his work, his company, his
		reputation -- and now he's going to
		tell you who I am.

	Parrish is struck dumb.  He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking
	his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and
	then commandingly.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in
		my pants.

			     JOE
		-- And now you're going to pee some
		more.

			     PARRISH
		Joe, don't do this --

			     JOE
		It's time to put this person where
		he belongs.

			     PARRISH
		It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's
		going to step aside --

			     DREW
		I'm not stepping anywhere --

			     JOE
		I appreciate your gentlemanliness,
		Bill, but what we need to do here is
		drive the dagger home --

			     DREW
		The dagger --?

			     PARRISH
		I told you to shut up.

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --

			     PARRISH
		He is --

			     JOE
		I'll take it from here --
			(to Drew)
		I am --

			     PARRISH
		-- An IRS man.

	Drew is stunned, Joe glances at Parrish, hesitates.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Yes, he is.  He's an -- IRS man.
		Aren't you, Joe?

	Joe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets
	the hint.

			     JOE
		Yes, I am.
			(to Drew)
		IRS man.

	Drew's head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again.

			     PARRISH
		The Treasury Department asked
		my cooperation in his undercover
		investigation of John Bontecou.
		They were convinced that Bontecou,
		on past deals, had structured his
		mergers and acquisitions in sus-
		picious and complicated ways so as
		to evade paying the taxes he is
		liable for.  The IRS wanted to go
		after him, and this deal offered
		them the opportunity.
			(a moment)
		I agreed to cooperate.

			     JOE
			(to Parrish)
		And we're very grateful.

			     PARRISH
		Moreover, Agent Joe Black here --
		of course that's not his real name
		-- smelled out your involvement,
		Drew.  He developed evidence you
		were working both sides of the
		fence.  Unfortunately, that's known
		as a conflict of interest --

			     JOE
		Undisclosed conflict of interest --

			     PARRISH
		An offense --

			     JOE
		An indictable offense.

	Silence.

			     DREW
		I think I'd like to talk to my
		lawyer --

			     PARRISH
		No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to
		offer you a deal.

	Drew is all attention.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Confess to the Board every details of
		your participation and then submit
		your resignation.

			     DREW
		And what do I get?

			     PARRISH
		You get not to go to jail.

			     DREW
		You're talking through your hat.
		You're offering a deal because
		you've got no proof.

			     PARRISH
		Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		And he's talking through his lips.

	Joe steps forward.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Make no mistake, Drew, if you choose
		to test my resolve in this matter,
		you'll be looking at an outcome that
		will have a finality that is beyond
		your comprehension, and you'll not
		be counting the days or the months
		or the years, but millenniums in the
		house with no doors.

	Drew slumps.

			     DREW
		All right, you win.  As soon as I
		get back to the city, I'll meet with
		the Board.

	Sloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
		You're meeting with the Board right
		now, Drew.  Resignation accepted.
		Moreover, I propose a motion to re-
		confirm William Parrish as Chairman
		of the Board of Parrish Communica-
		tions as well as a rejection of the
		merger with Bontecou International.
		How say you, Board?

	A chorus of thunderous "Yes"es resounds through the
	SPEAKERPHONE.

			     SLOANE (O.S., cont'd)
		The motion is passed.

			     PARRISH
		Well, thank you, that's great, but
		it's more than I bargained for.  I
		just wanted to set the record
		straight.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
		But we want you back, Bill.  Mean-
		while, enjoy your party, celebrate,
		we'll attend to the nasty details.
		And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

			     JOE
		My pleasure.  This is an IRS Agent's
		dream.  I'll be promoted to Chief of
		Section off of this.

	Parrish clicks the speakerphone off.  Drew is staring at
	Joe, shaking his head.

			     DREW
		Who would've ever believed it?  You,
		an IRS Agent --

	Silence.  Joe shrugs, smiles.

			     JOE
		'Death and Taxes'.

	The door flies open, an anxious Allison appears.

			     ALLISON
		Daddy!  We've been looking all over
		for you - this is your party - what
		are you doing in here?  Never mind.
		You're on.  Let's go.

	She pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room,
	Joe right behind them.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the
	orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears
	with Allison.  An enormous cake is unveiled with one great,
	lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.  He pauses over the
	cake, now blows the candle out.  APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech!
	Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes
	loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the
	crowd.  Joe observes from the fringe.

			     PARRISH
			(to the guests)
		I thought I was going to sneak away
		tonight...

	YELLS of "No!"  "Never!"

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		...What a glorious night, every
		face I see is a memory.  It may not
		be a perfectly perfect memory --
		sometimes we had our ups and downs
		-- but we're all together, and
		you're mine for a night.
			(a moment)
		-- And I'm going to break precedent,
		and tell you my one-candle wish --
		that you would have a life as lucky
		as mine, where you can wake up one
		morning and say "I don't want
		anything more."
			(another moment)
		Sixty-five years - don't they go by
		in a blink?

	Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows
	into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.  Quince
	grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.  Now
	Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they
	hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated
	by a surge of guests.  Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but
	there is a tinge of sadness about her.  He heads towards her,
	they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.

			     SUSAN
		What a night.

			     PARRISH
		I'm having a helluva time.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		You were right about Joe, he is
		going somewhere --

			     PARRISH
			(gently)
		I'm sorry.

	Susan is examining Parrish very closely.

			     SUSAN
		Are you relieved?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, but --

	Parrish hesitates.

			     SUSAN
		But what?

			     PARRISH
		I want you to know how much I love
		you.  That you've given a meaning
		to my life that I had no right to
		expect, and that no one can ever
		take from me.

			     SUSAN
		Daddy --

			     PARRISH
		No -- I love you so much and I want
		you to promise me something.  I
		don't want you to ever worry about
		me.  If anything should happen, I'm
		going to be fine and everything's
		going to be all right.
			(a moment)
		-- And I have no regrets.

	Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		And I want you to feel that way,
		too.

			     SUSAN
		I love you, Daddy --

			     PARRISH
		That's why it's okay.

	They drift into silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		No regrets?

	After a moment.

			     SUSAN
		'No regrets'.

	A long silence, Susan smiles.

			     PARRISH
		It's a good feeling, isn't it?

	Silence again.

			     SUSAN
		Everybody's saying goodbye...

	They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an
	understanding.

			     PARRISH
		I'm still here.
			(a moment)
		Would you like to dance with me,
		Susan?

			     SUSAN
		Oh, yes --

	He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.

			     PARRISH
		If you don't mind dancing with an
		old fogey like me.

			     SUSAN
		Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll
		never be old.

	He takes her in his arms and they dance away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still
	commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.  His eyes are on
	Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.
	A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.

			     WAITER
		Can I get you anything, sir?

	Joe regards the Waiter for a moment.

			     JOE
		Do you have any peanut butter?

	The Waiter hesitates.

			     WAITER
		I don't think so, sir.

			     JOE
		Thank you, anyway.

	The Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish and
	Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	On the dance floor.

			     PARRISH
		What was that?

			     SUSAN
		The fireworks are about to start.

	Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Shall we?

			     PARRISH
		You go ahead, honey, I'm going to
		catch my breath.

	Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at
	him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she
	smiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the
	fireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns
	and heads up towards Joe.

	Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.

			     JOE
		Happy Birthday, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you.

	They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks.
	Joe's gaze lingers.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Did you say goodbye?

			     JOE
		Not exactly.

			     PARRISH
		I guess you have your reasons.

			     JOE
		Yes.

	Silence.

			     PARRISH
		Now that we have a moment, would you
		mind if I expressed my gratitude for
		what you did for Susan?

	Joe waits.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I never heard her speak of any man
		as she spoke of you -- It was always
		what I wanted for her -- but what
		happens to her now?

			     JOE
		I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.
		These things have a way of working
		out.

	Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish
	has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:

			     JOE (cont'd)
		And would you mind if I expressed my
		gratitude...?

	Parrish waits.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		For you.  For the time you've given
		me.  For the person you are.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll
		ruin my autopsy.

	Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the
	crowd below, searching.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		It's hard to let go, isn't it?

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     PARRISH
		That's life.  What can I tell you?

	A silence, an understanding there is another more to say.
	Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?",
	Parrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away
	from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
	the river.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial
	fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest
	isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over-
	powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a
	distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some-
	thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
	her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the
	fireworks.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.

			     PARRISH
		I'm getting a little dizzy, I can
		feel my heart pumping --

	But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on
	up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step
	with him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Should I be afraid?

	Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.

			     JOE
		Not a man like you.

	Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides
	out again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue
	on and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage
	of fireworks lights up the sky.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
	up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates,
	now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
	walks up towards the hill.

	Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
	over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
	He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
	seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
	pulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he
	keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.

			     SUSAN
		Joe...?

	He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right
	in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so
	appealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet
	close.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You're here...

	He is trying to get his bearings.

			     JOE
		-- You bet.

	Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative.

			     SUSAN
		Where did you go?

	Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of
	time and place.

			     JOE
		I don't know -- y'know, I don't know
		-- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And
		would y'know what I mean if I said I
		don't think it's worth figuring out?

	Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her
	lightheaded.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		...But now I'm back.

	Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an
	answer.

			     SUSAN
			(gently)
		That's it?

			     JOE
		Well, I don't know what else to say.
		It's a helluva party --

			     SUSAN
		You think so?

			     JOE
		Yeah...and you're the prettier
		thing here.

	Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his
	jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she
	regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
	with the last moments fades away.

	Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,
	a sudden intake of breath.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Hey, you all right?

	His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her
	support.

			     SUSAN
		The coffee shop --

	The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.

			     YOUNG MAN
		I asked you if I said something
		wrong and you said it was so right
		it scared you.

	Susan holds herself very still.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		And forgive me for saying this --
		but then you said -- and it's been
		with me ever since --

			     SUSAN
		What has --?

	He hesitates.

			     YOUNG MAN
		You said you liked me.

			     SUSAN
		No --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Y'didn't?

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		I said I liked you so much.

	She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments'
	revelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which
	is on the edge of pain.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Hey, everything's going great --
		don't y'think?

	She doesn't answer for a moment.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		Don't you feel that way?

			     SUSAN
		...We know so little about each
		other.

			     YOUNG MAN
		But we've got time.

	She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open,
	completely vulnerable, waiting for her response.  A long
	silence, the words come out haltingly:

			     SUSAN
		I wish you could've known my
		father...

	Another moment.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Me, too.

	Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are
	completely intent on each other.

			     SUSAN
		...What do we do now?

	A long silence.

			     YOUNG MAN
		It will come to us.

	Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes
	up from below, the night fills with light.  The Young Man
	searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together
	they start back towards the party.

	THE END
MIDNIGHT IN PARIS

                        GIL (V.O.)
              This is unbelievable - look at
              this. There's no city like this in
              the world. There never was.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              It's become so touristy.
                         GIL (V.O.)
              Well that's just the awful era we
              live in but can you just imagine
              what this was like before - but
              even with all the fast food joints
              and the traffic - god, you just
              can't imagine what it was like
              years ago.
                         INEZ (V.O.)
              Well you like cities.
                        GIL (V.O.)
              I really do - I love cities - I
              love big cities with all the crowds
              and all the action.
    (Having seen a panoramic view of let us say the Champs Elysee
    we embark on a montage of the city. The comments offered
    above and following are an approximation of what the actors

              I don't get here often enough is
              the problem. Every once in a while
              for a few days is nothing - my
              biggest regret is that I didn't
              settle here the first time I came.
              I should have gone with my
              instincts.

              I admit it's pretty but so are so
              many other places I've visited.

              I'm thinking of a painting by
              Pisarro I've seen of Paris in the
              rain. Can you picture how drop
              dead gorgeous this city is in the
              rain? Imagine this town in the
              twenties - Paris in the twenties -
              in the rain - the artists and
              writers - I was born too late. Why
              did God deliver me into the world
              in the 1970's and in Pasadena yet.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              Why does every city have to be in
              the rain? What's wonderful about
              getting wet?
                        GIL (V.O.)
              It's romantic.

                         INEZ (V.O.)
              Oh god, no. I could never live out
              of the United States. And if I
              could it would be someplace totally
              different.

              Like?

              Yes but it's - Hawaiian.
                        GIL (V.O.)

              novels and not gotten into grinding
              out movie scripts.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              Right, and becoming rich and

                         GIL (V.O.)

              There's nothing wrong with your
              father and I disagreeing. That's
              what democracy is. Your father
              defends the right wing of the
              Republican party and I happen to
              think they represent sub-mental
              Neanderthals. But we respect each
              other's views - am I right?
                  (this last directed at
                   John gets no enthusiasm

              Can we discuss the wedding plans?
              Your father's used his good offices
              with the opera to get some of the
              singers to attend and sing. I
              thought Puccini would be nice.

              Just no Wagner. When she walks
              down the aisle not The Ride of the
              Valkyries. Hey look, I just want
              to say that I am politically
              bipartisan in that, in my view, to
              be a politician of any party one
              must of necessity be a whore.

              I hardly think the Sorbo nne would

              your novel to read. I'm sure he'd
              be able to critique your writing

               here in about 1682 - originally
               this was all swamp land - in fact,
               if I'm not mistaken, in old French
               the word Versailles means something
               like "terrain where the weeds have
               been pulled". The main structure
               is French classical style at its
               height - the work, I believe of

     Paul, Carol, Gil and Inez getting guided tour.   Guide speaks
     French and mostly English - as she feels.
                         GUIDE
               This is, of course, Rodin's most
               famous statue. A cast of this work
               was placed next to his tomb. Rodin
               wished for it to serve as his
               headstone and epitaph.

                            PAUL
              That would be in Meudon. He died
              of the flu if I'm not mistaken -
              1917 I believe.
                        GUIDE
              Exactly correct. You know your art
              history, monsieur. The design -
                            PAUL
                   (cutting her off)
              The Thinker is so powerful because
              he thinks not just with his brain -
              he thinks with every limb and
              muscle - you feel the
              concentration.
                        INEZ
                  (to Gil)
              He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?


                            PAUL
              So much of Rodin's work was
              influenced by his wife, Camille.
                        GUIDE
              Yes, she was an influence - though
              Camille was not the wife but his
              mistress.
                            PAUL
              Camille?      No.
                            GUIDE
              Yes.      Rose was the wife.
                            PAUL
              He never married Rose.
                        GUIDE
              Yes, in the last year of their
              lives.
                            PAUL
              I think you're mistaken.
                        CAROL
              Are you arguing with the guide?

                  Ah, non, non, je suis certaine.

                            GIL
                  I'm afraid she's right. I just
                  read the recent two volume
                  biography of Rodin - Rose was
                  definitely the wife, Camille the
                  mistress.
                            PAUL
                  You read that? Where did you read
                  that?
                            GIL
                  I did - no question.    Camille-
                  Rose.
                            INEZ
                  Don't forget, Dad invited you to
                  join us at a wine tasting tonight.
                            CAROL
                  It'll be so fun. Paul's an expert
                  on French wines.

                      (walking with Gil)
                  When did you read the biography of

                            GIL
                  Me? Why would I read a biography
                  of Rodin?

                         HELEN
               You should talk, John - especially
               for someone who once advocated the
               boycott of french wines.

               I'll always take a California wine
               but the Napa Valley is six thousand
               miles away.

               To me they're all great.   What the
               hell do I know?

               Pheromones, it's your pheromones.
     Paul and Carol have ambled over, having heard Gil's last
     amorous remark.
                         PAUL
               Ah yes - sex and alcohol - It fuels
               the desire but kills the
               performance - according to the
               Bard.
                          CAROL
               Have you tasted the '61? It's
               divine - though Paul found it -
               what?
                         PAUL
               Slightly more tannic than the '59.
               I prefer a smoky feeling to a
               fruity feeling, don't you agree?
                         GIL
               You will admit she's a sexy woman.

     Gil wanders. Eventually he is at a lovely spot. Perhaps by
     the river, the bridge - or somewhere else but he's just
     wandering lost. Finally he looks at his watch.
     Either by his watch or a nearby building clock, the hands
     move to exactly midnight. perhaps midnight chimes somewhere.
     At precisely that moment a car happens to pull up along side
     him. Inside are TWO MEN and TWO WOMAN - elegant - they have

     There is a mixture of elegant plus bohemian types. In the
     background a MAN sits at the piano singing a Cole Porter
     tune. Gil looks at the revelers. A few CUTS. Music plays.
     Finally A WOMAN comes over to Gil.

                  What are you writing?
                             GIL
                  A novel.

                  About what?
                            GIL
                  A man who works in a nostalgia
                  shop.

                  Where they sell old things -
                  memorabilia. Does that sound
                  terrible to you?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  No subject is terrible if the story
                  is true. If the prose is clean and
                  honest and if it affirms courage
                  and grace under pressure.
                            GIL
                  Would you do me the biggest favor
                  in the world - I can't even ask ···
                            HEMINGWAY
                  What?
                            GIL
                  Would you read it?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  Your novel?
                            GIL
                  It's only about four hundred pages -
                  if you could just give me your
                  opinion.
                            HEMINGWAY
                  My opinion is I hate it.
                            GIL
                  You do?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  If it's bad I'll hate it because I
                  hate bad writing and if it's good
                  I'll be envious and hate it all the
                  more. You don't want the opinion
                  of another writer.
                            GIL
                  But there's no one I really trust
                  to evaluate it -
                            HEMINGWAY
                  Writers are competitive.
                            GIL
                  I could never compete with you -

                            HEMINGWAY
                  You're too self-effacing - it's not
                  manly. If you're a writer, declare
                  yourself the best writer - but
                  you're not the best as long as I'm
                  around. Unless you want to put the
                  gloves on and settle it.

                  I won't read your novel but I'll
                  tell you what I'll do.
                            GIL
                  Yes?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  I'll bring it over to Gertrude
                  Stein. She's the only one I trust
                  to read my work. No one discovers
                  new talent like Gert - whether it's
                  poetry, painting, music - She'll
                  tell you if you have a book or not.
                            GIL
                  You could have Gertrude Stein read
                  my novel?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  Give it to me.
                            GIL
                  I have to get it.   It's at the
                  hotel.
                            HEMINGWAY

                  I'm so thrilled - my heart is
                  beating. I'll go home and get it -
                  I'll give it to you - I can't tell
                  you what this means to me.

                  novel - thank you, thank you -

               Fitzgerald - Hemingway - the
               Hemingway - Papa - where do I meet
               him - he never said.
     Gil goes to return to the cafe - he can't find the door, nor
     the club facade. It's gone.
     We are in the present and he searches the wall of a facade
     where he came out but he is in despair over the fact he can't
     find it.

               Can I tell you Zelda Fitzgerald is
               exactly as we've come to know her
               from articles and books - she's
               mercurial and moody and she does
               not get along with Hemingway - and
               Scott knows Hemingway's right about
               it but you can see how conflicted
               he is because he loves her -
                         INEZ
               Right, right - er where's my cold
               cream - we should knock off the
               idle chatter because we're going to
               be late.
                          GIL
               Actually I wanted to stay and work
               on my novel - it needs a little
               polishing.
                         INEZ
               You can work on it later. And we
               can use Mom's decorator's discount.

     The period car comes - the door opens.        We hear Hemingway'S

              had lost his hand when a grenade
              went off and he couldn't fight as
              he could when I first met him and
              he was young and brave and the hill
              was soggy from days of rain and
              sloped down toward a road and there
              were many German soldiers on the
              road and the idea was to aim at the
              first group and if our aim was true
              we could delay them.

              You'll never write well if you fear
              dying. Do you?
                        GIL
              It's my biggest fear.
                        HEMINGWAY
              But it's something all men before
              you have done and all men will do.

              Yes but -
                        HEMINGWAY
              Have you ever made love to a truly
              great woman?
                        GIL
              My fiance is very sexy.
                        HEMINGWAY
              And when you make love to her you
              feel true and beautiful passion and
              you at least for that moment lose
              your fear of death.
                         GIL

                             HEMINGWAY
                   I believe that love that's true and
                   real creates a respite from death.
                   All cowardice comes from not loving
                   or not loving well which is the
                   same thing and when the man who is
                   brave and true looks death squarely
                   in the face like some rhino hunters
                   I know or Belmonte who is truly
                   brave, it is because they love with
                   sufficient passion to push death
                   out of their minds till it returns
                   as it does to all men and then you
                   must make really good love again.
                   Think about it.

              I was just telling Pablo that this
              portrait doesn't capture Adriana.
              It has universality but no
              objectivity.
                        PABLO
              Vous ne le comprenez pas
              correctment. Vous ne connaissez
              pas Adriana mais c'est tout ce qui
              la represente.
                         STEIN
              No tu n'a pas raison. Look how
              he's done her - dripping with
              sexual innuendo. Carnal to the
              point of smoldering and yes she's
              beautiful but it's a subtle beauty -
              an implied sensuality.
                   (to Gil)
              What is your first impression of
              Adriana?
                         GIL
                   (very taken)
              ····· Exceptionally lovely.

              You're right Gertrude - of course
              you can see why he's lost his
              objectivity.

              Mais c'est comme elle est, si vous
              la connaissez.
                        STEIN
              Yes - avec vous en prive - because
              she's your lover - but we don't
              know her that way - so you make a

                  was another woman - many - and now
                  with Pablo - I mean Pablo is
                  married but every day it's on
                  again, off again - I don't know how
                  any woman can stay with him - he's

                  these days so many Americans feel

               Wonderful but forgettable.     I've
               seen that picture.

                   The juxtaposition of color is
                   amazing. This man was the real
                   father of abstract expressionism.
                   I take that back, maybe Turner.
                             INEZ
                   I prefer Monet. I mean I love
                   Turner but this is overwhelming.

                   If I'm not mistaken it took him two
                   years to complete this. And he

                   cloying.

                mistress Madeline Brissou in the
                twenties.
                          GIL
                Er - I have to differ with you on
                this one.

                           GIL
                If I'm not mistaken this was a
                failed attempt to capture a young
                French girl named Adriana - from
                Bordeaux - if my art history serves
                me - came to Paris to study costume
                design for the theatre. Believe
                she had a brief affair with
                Modigliani - then Braque - that's
                where Pablo met her - er Picasso.
                You'd never know it from this
                portrait but she's quite subtly
                beautiful.

                What have you been smoking?
                          GIL
                And I'd hardly call the picture
                superb. It's more of a petit
                bourgeoise statement of how Pablo
                er Picasso sees her, saw her - he's
                distracted by the fact she was a
                volcano in the sack.

                  I was at Gertrude Stein's - she's
                  almost finished with my novel. And
                  the Fitzgeralds invited me over and

                  throw a party - only the

              But he has more courage. He faces
              death more directly and more often
              and if you chose him I would be
              disappointed but understand.
                        JUAN BELMONTE
              Por desgracia para ambos ella ha
              elegido Pablo.
                        HEMINGWAY
              Yes, she's chosen Picasso - But
              Pablo thinks women are only to
              paint or sleep with.

              And you?

              I think women are the equal of men
              in courage. Have you ever shot a

                  two thousandth millennium to here -

                  Love - the word love - love - the
                  word love - same as the word
                  rhinoceros - the rhinoceros makes
                  love by mounting the female - but

               Nevertheless you have to get rid of
               all that technology - what's good
               about your book are the characters -
               the human questions - love -
               mortality - nobody cares about the
               technology, they care about the
               human heart. We all fear death and
               question our place in the universe.
               Unfortunately your book lapses into
               easy pessimism. I was having this
               conversation with Giacometti the
               other day - he's such a gloom
               monger.

               Still, those sculptures -
                          STEIN
               It's the artist's job not to
               succumb to despair but to find an
               antidote to the emptiness of
               existence. I find your voice clear
               and lively - don't be such a
               defeatist.

               That immediate magic one hears

               both Picasso and Hemingway are in
               love with me but for whatever
               inexplicable reasons the heart has,
               I am drawn to Gil. Perhaps because
               he seems naive and unassuming.

               As always in this sad life he is

               I had a dream where he came to me
               and brought me a little gift -
               earrings they were - and we made
               love. perhaps it is just as well I
               accept Hemingway's offer to go to
               Africa. Life with Pablo is too
               full of conflict and I am
               suffocating under his genius. Why
               I need to go from one brilliant man
               to another is my weakness. Gil is
               different, perhaps not a genius but
               not moody and selfish like Pablo or
               Amedeo was. I think a trip to
               Africa with Hemingway would help
               get these feelings for Gil off my
               mind.

     Amidst the ad-lib moment, Gil has managed to secure a private
     spot and has swiped the box. He's torn it open and removing

                  and left them out or dropped them,
                  and the maid found them and left
                  them out where you could see them
                  easily.

                  the Belle Epoque. In those years
                  Paris lived only for beauty.

                  I've always been a logical person.
                  I never took chances - did anything
                  crazy - like move here when I first
                  came or take a shot at being a real
                  writer, not a Hollywood hired hand -
                  but I feel like letting everything
                  go.

                  this is the greatest, most
                  beautiful era Paris has ever known.

                  The twenties are full of strife and
                  uncertainty. But think of it, Gil -

                  Debussy and Guimard. Maybe you can
                  meet Balzac.

                    But I'm from the twenties and I'm
                    tellin~ you the golden age is the
                    Belle Epoque.
                              GIL
                    Yes but don't you see - to these
                    guys the golden age was the
                    Renaissance. They'd all trade the
                    Belle Epoque to paint alongside
                    Michelangelo or Titian. And those
                    guys probably imagine life was
                    better when Kubla Khan was around.
                    I'm having an insight. A minor one
                    but that accounts for the anxiety
                    of my dream.

                    Last night I dreamed I ran out of
                    zithromax - and then I went to the
                    dentist and there was no novacaine -
                    these people have no antibiotics -

                    What are you talking about?
                              GIL
                    And even in the twenties - no
                    dishwashers - no 911 if your
                    appendix bursts - no "movies on
                    demand" ·
                              ADRIANA
                    But if we love each other what does
                    it matter when we live?
                               GIL
                    Because if you stay here and this
                    becomes your present, sooner or
                    later you'll imagine another time
                    was really the golden time. And so
                    will I - I'm beginning to see why
                    it can't work, Adriana. The
                    present has a hold on you because
                    it's your present and while there's
                    never any progress in the most
                    important things, you get to
                    appreciate - what little progress
                    is made - the internet - Pepto-
                    Bismol. The present is always
                    going to seem unsatisfying because
                    life itself is unsatisfying -
                    that's why Gauguin goes back and
                    forth between Paris and Tahiti,
                    searching - it's my job as a writer
                    to try and come up with reasons why
                    despite life being tragic and
                    unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
                               ADRIANA
                    That's the problem with writers -
                    you're all so full of words - but
                    I'm more emotional. I'm going to
                    stay and live in Paris' most
                    glorious time. You made a choice
                    to leave Paris once and you
                    regretted it.
                              GIL
                    Yes, that one I regretted but it
                    was a real choice and I made the
                    wrong one. This is a choice
                    between accepting reality or
                    surreal insanity.
                                                                      83

                            ADRIANA
                  So finally you do love Inez more
                  than me.
                            GIL
                  No - I love you - but this way lies
                  madness - and if I'm ever going to
                  write anything worthwhile I've got
                  to get rid of my illusions and that
                  I'd be happier in the past is one
                  of them.

               From Ernest Hemingway. He thought

               again.

              Jesus Christ I'm dealing with a

              few nights alone. We danced, we
              drank - you were always working -
              he's very attractive, he spoke to
              me in French - the whole mystique
              of this corny city got to me - it's
              over. We can put this all in

              I'm staying here. It's not the

     Gil walking at night. He sees someone approaching and
     realizes it is the girl from the Flea Market, Gabrielle.
                         GIL
               Hey, I know you - the girl at the
               flea market.
                         GABRIELLE
               Oh yes - yes - the Cole Porter one.
                         GIL
               What are you doing here?
                          GABRIELLE
               I'm returning from dinner with my
               girlfriends. I live near here.
                         GIL
               What's your name?
                            GABRIELLE
               Gabrielle.
                         GIL
               Gabrielle, - I'm Gil - I just moved
               to Paris this week.
                         GABRIELLE
               Oh I'm sure you'll love it.
                         GIL
               Can I walk along with you or can I
               buy you a coffee? Oh god, it's
               starting to rain.
                         GABRIELLE
               That's okay. I don't mind getting
               wet. Paris is the most beautiful
               in the rain.
                         GIL
               Oh what a thing to say.     I couldn't
               agree more.
                         GABRIELLE
               I just thought about you the other
               day because my boss got in a whole
               album of Cole Porter songs.
                         GIL
               Hey what are those bells?
                                                       89

               It's midnight.
                         GIL
               Midnight - right - right - pretty
               name.
     FADE OUT as they walk off together in the rain.

                                                         3 FEBRUARY 1999




FADE IN:

MAIN CREDITS ROLL

over BLACK SCREEN, with PORTENTOUS SPOOKY MUSIC underneath. Just as the
music reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian SCREECH.

A BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine. TITLE WIPES IN with
him:

                             MONKEYBONE(tm)
                                   in
                            "FREUD CHICKEN!"

TIGHT CLOSEUP - STANLEY (ANIMATED)

A POCKETWATCH swings back and forth in F.G. Gaping at it is a goofy,
bespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER, sucking his thumb as his EYES move back
and forth. After a moment, the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the right
eye keeps going back and forth with the watch.

                           SHRINK'S VOICE (o.s.)
            Back, Stanley...you're going back...back to when
            it all began. Are you going back yet? Come on,
            get back, ve haven't got all day.

Now BOTH EYES are locked in place. The patient is hypnotized.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED)

A squat, lumpy TEACHER, MISS HUDLAPP, is straining to erase the
Gettysburg Address, which is written along the very top of the
blackboard. There's an obtrusive, rhythmic BANGING noice in B.G.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It was third grade. The teacher was Miss
            Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she
            smelled funny - but she was kind.

                           MISS HUDLAPP
            CLASS!
                 (turning around suddenly)
            How many times have I told you? In this class we
            do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley's head!


REVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY

Hapless ten-year-old STANLEY, still goofy and bespectacled, in his
front-row desk. NAILS stick out of his head. The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised
around him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling.

A dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEY's face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            You know how some teachers have those, kind of,
            flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp
            flab that like, dangle?

As MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off, TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty
gallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR.

MISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust.
Young STANLEY watches, transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS. We TRACK IN
on the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth,
with a loud SLAP each time they collide.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I
            watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to
            feel...well...oddly...

Now we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY. A SONG comes up underneath:
Donna Summer, "I FEEL LOVE."

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            ...aroused.
                 (beat)
            And then the horror began.

DOINK! STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror. The boys and girls
around him are pointing and tittering.

Grimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto
his lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. But SPROING!! - the BOOK
goes flying across the room. The BULGE is fighting back!

The kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK of
textbooks onto his lap. It's no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying, and
BOOKS come raining down on the entire class! Now MISS HUDLAPP is staring
directly at him...

                           MISS HUDLAPP
            Young man. What's that in your lap?

She marches toward him. STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on
            the Washington Monument. And then...all at once
            ...there he was.

The BACKPACK bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to GET
OUT. And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES!

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            Monkeybone!!

The libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack, POINTS at MISS
HUDLAPP - and announces, in his Barry White baritone:

                           MONKEYBONE
            Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way.

KC and the SUNSHINE BAND comes up underneath as MONKEYBONE DANCES to the
front of the class. He grabs MISS HUDLAPP by the hands and begins
dancing The Bump with her ARM FLAPS. Butt left, WHAP. Butt right, WHAP.

The KIDS are bug-eyed - agog. With each WHAP their little heads turn
back and forth as if they're watching a nude tennis match.


INT. SCREENING ROOM - ON AUDIENCE (LIVE-ACTION)

A roomful of LIVE HUMANS watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync
with the kids onscreen. TV-INDUSTRY HIPSTERS, AD EXECS, MANUFACTURER'S
REPS...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the Monkeybone show,
and they're LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY.

In the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: JULIE McELROY and
STU MILEY. JULIE's a research scientist, brainy, professional,
abnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating
if it weren't for a prominent goofy streak.

STU is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon
on the screen. In fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously
around to see how the rest of the audience is responding.

Why? Because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen.
In his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self-
deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of STANLEY.

INT. CLASSROOM (ANIMATED)

As the monkey dance continues, we ZOOM IN on the mortified face of
LITTLE STANLEY. His eyes begin doing the familiar HYPNO-SWIRL...

INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE (ANIMATED)

A CUCKOO pops out of a wall clock. ADULT STANLEY'S THUMB pops out of his
mouth. He awakens from his trance in a cold sweat.

                           STANLEY
            How about it, Doc? Can you help me?

                           SHRINK
            Not overnight. These imaginary monkey cases take
            time. I vould estimate...roughly...

On the desk is a CATALOGUE, open to a two-page spread depicting a 40-
foot CABIN CRUISER. "NEW FOR SUMMER! ONLY $229,999.95!" With his free
hand, the SHRINK is working a CALCULATOR...

                           SHRINK
            Twelve years and three months ought to do it.

The SHRINK hustles STANLEY to the door and shakes his hand.

                           STANLEY
            One question, doc - what did you mean when you
            said "imaginary"?

                           SHRINK
            All in good time, my boy. All in good time.

The SHRINK shoves STANLEY out and slams the door behind him. Two beats.
Then he doubles over, WEEPING with LAUGHTER.

                           SHRINK
            Vot a crackpot! Monkey on ze back - HAH!! ROLL
            OUT ZE WACKY WAGON!!

Now he notices a BACKPACK, which STANLEY has left on the couch. It
TWITCHES slightly - of its own free will.

                           VOICE IN BACKPACK
            Imaginary, huh? You quack.


EXT. SHRINK'S BUILDING (ANIMATED)

A WINDOW shatters. The SHRINK comes hurtling out. MONKEYBONE STRADDLES
HIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the
way down to the street.

SPLAT! A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the building.
He kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE.

                           STANLEY
            Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a
            good shrink.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Those guys are a waste of money! I'll show you
            how to stop sucking your thumb...

MONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off
into the sunset.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

STANDING O from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up.
HERB, an all-purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium:

                           HERB
            Thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is,
            Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an
            order for six new episodes!

HERB leads a round of APPLAUSE. JULIE nudges STU - the only guy in the
room who's still in his seat.

                           HERB
            Now, let's give it up for the guy who started it
            all. Creator of America's most disturbed comic
            strip...the man behind the monkey...Mister Stu
            Miley!

A SPOTLIGHT hits him, and he STANDS to tumultuous applause. He looks
genuinely stunned. He can't believe it's happening.

JULIE surreptitiously PINCHES him on the bottom, giving him a start. She
WINKS at him. He shoots her a small private smile - then turns to WAVE
at the adoring crowd.

INT. LOBBY - HALF-HOUR LATER - NIGHT

STU working his way through a crowd of well-wishers and FANS.

                           STU
            I don't actually draw all the animation, no. We
            have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at
            Nike doing that.

A beautiful, heavily-pierced FEMALE FAN hands STU a marker.

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my
            belly? As a guide?

                           STU
            Guide...?

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            For my tattoo artist?

She exposes her taut midriff. STU thinks for a moment, then goes to
work. When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the
girl's pants and WAVING to her. Nearby FANS APPLAUD.

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            Wait! You have to draw the rest of him -

She begins unbuckling her belt so STU will have enough room to draw
Monkeybone's bottom half. STU demurs...

                           STU
            I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor. DO-
            OCCCC!!

He wanders across the room, finds JULIE deep in conversation with a
bunch of other GUESTS, and pulls her aside.

                           STU
            Hey, Doc. Come here. There's something really
            cool I want to show you.

He grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to -

INT. ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

There's nothing "cool" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal
fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside.

                           STU
            See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out
            ...they close...you can't get back in!

He opens one door and holds it for JULIE.

                           JULIE
            You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit!
            Everyone loves you!

                           STU
            They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.

                           JULIE
            It was you who got the standing O. It was you
            drawing on the belly over there...

                           STU
            That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I
            don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of
            media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone!
                 (conspiratorially)
            I have something I have to give you.

                           JULIE
            Can't you give it to me later?

                           STU
            Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got
            here sooner, it would be...better.

He gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. For a
moment they completely forget about the party in the next room.

Then HERB appears behind them, trying to catch STU's eye as he waits for
the clinch to break up. Finally he pries them apart:

                           HERB
            Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I
            know you don't like the idea, but you really
            ought to talk to these guys -

                           STU
            Julie and I - we were just gonna go...

But before STU knows what's hit him, HERB is leading him back to -


INT. LOBBY - THAT MOMENT - CONTINUOUS

                           HERB
            Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You
            got three major toy companies...you got the guys
            from Burger God over here...

                           STU
            Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in
            the french fries?

                           HERB
            Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre-
            emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -

The MERCHANDISERS shoot STU an expectant wave. STU waves back and turns
in the opposite direction. HERB grabs him by the sleeve.

                           STU
            Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.

                           HERB
            Do you know what kind of opportunity you have
            here? You gotta strike. I'm talking mansions.
            Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you
            brush your teeth!

                           STU
            I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!

                           HERB
            Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie
            perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures
            from killing them.

                           STU
            Herb. I have to go.

                           HERB
            Why?

                           STU
            I got the ring.
                 (beat)
            Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.

He nods toward JULIE, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of
punch. HERB realizes a proposal is in the works.

                           HERB
            Oh my God...you're proposing?

                           STU
            My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she...
            fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never
            been. She loves me the way I am - right now.
                 (beat)

            I don't want everything to change. I don't want
            her saying yes to some big success. I just want
            her saying yes to me.

                           HERB
            ...In some weird way I respect that.

JULIE's over by the punchbowl. She sees the two boys staring at her
conspiratorially - MAKES A FACE at them as she waves back.

                           HERB
            Okay then. If I get you out of here - you pop
            the question - tonight. Or else. Get me?

STU nods gravely.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

STU, JULIE, and HERB in the parking lot. A small safari of FLUNKIES is
loading enormous boxes full of MONKEYBONE JUNK into STU's beat-up car -
stuffed dolls, action figures, board games, lunchboxes, beach towels,
team jackets and more! STU groans at the sight of it...

                           HERB
            They're just prototypes...take 'em home and look
            at 'em before you say no...
                 (scanning the streets)
            If you could just hold on a minute or two, we're
            expecting a couple more trucks.

STU GLOWERS at HERB as he opens the car door for JULIE.

                           HERB
            Okay, okay! You're a beautiful couple. Go.

INT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

STU backs out of his space. The small parking lot is full of DELIVERY
TRUCKS from would-be merchandisers - all too large for the spaces
they're parked in. STU has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are
blocked. It's like negotiating a labyrinth.

                           STU
            Look at this! He won't let us leave!

                           JULIE
            Who?

                           STU
            The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over
            both our lives if we let him.

                           JULIE
            Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck. You
            thought him up, and everybody loves him, and
            he's probably going to make you rich. So relax!
            Enjoy it!

                           STU
            I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had
            any good luck, until I met you...what if it's
            all just another bad dream?

                           JULIE
            What's the "bad" part?

                           STU
            I might wake up.

                           JULIE
                 (laughing; taking his hand)

            If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So
            face it. You're just going to have to be happy!

                           STU
            I am happy. It just so happens this is the
            happiest night of my life.

He says it so solemnly that she cracks up. After a moment he joins in.

EXT. PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A PLASTIC BANNER stretches between two poles on either side of the entry
to the lot. It shows MONKEYBONE in a typical languorous pose:

                  It's His World. We Just Live in It!
                               MONKEYBONE
                        Sunday Nights This Fall

TWO GUYS on EXTENSION LADDERS are taking the sign down as STU'S CAR
idles at the exit below. There's a strong wind tonight, and one guy
LOSES HOLD of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...

INT. CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

As STU pulls into the intersection he sees a DELIVERY TRUCK approaching
in the opposite lane, with a cardboard likeness of MONKEYBONE mounted
atop the cab. He chuckles...

                           STU
            That damn monkey is everywh--

Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS. The MONKEYBONE BANNER has
fallen DIRECTLY ACROSS HIS WINDSHIELD, like a huge SHROUD. All he can
see is a great, grinning MONKEY FACE!!

JULIE SCREAMS. STU SCREAMS. Unable to see, he slams on the brakes and
JERKS THE WHEEL RIGHT.

Off screen: HORNS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. The horrible crunch of METAL
ON METAL.

But Stu's car comes to a halt untouched. After a moment he opens his
eyes...and JULIE opens hers...

                           STU
            Did we just - hit something?

                           JULIE
            I don't think so.

                           STU
            Are you okay??

She thinks it over, nods. STU takes a moment to catch his breath, then
opens the door gingerly. A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the
opposite lane, nearly taking STU's door off. He jumps back inside,
waits, opens the door again...

EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT

His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The
asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games,
lunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this
SWERVED...

...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a
TELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up
like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for
the prom - seem to be okay.

                           STU
            Hey! Are you guys all right in there?

                           TEENAGE GIRL
            We're fine.

                           STU
            That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my
            windshield - it practically killed us all!
                 (to JULIE)
            God, Julie, if anything had happened to you -

                           JULIE
            I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.

                           STU
            I'd better go report this...

He spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street. On the way there he
plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with
both hands.

JULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is
glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description.

                           JULIE
            Dad's car?

The BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy.

Then: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise,
like nails on a blackboard...

                           TEENAGE GIRL
            What was that? Did you hear that?

The horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the
TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it
TOPPLES. Directly toward...

                           JULIE
            STU!!

ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH

He sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger.

                           STU
            Operator? I want to report an accident.

Finally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming
down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes
widen. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp...

CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE

A HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which
STU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an
insane, almost macabre grin.

The screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a
DISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus...

STU'S POV: ON JULIE

He's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him,
working feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand.

                           JULIE
            Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love
            you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise -

All at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if
SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the
floor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant:

                           JULIE (V.O.)
            I'm here, baby. I won't leave you...

And then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down
through some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing
SHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him...

An AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes
close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in:

EXT. TROLLEY - MOVING

A tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of
an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a
vast black VOID...

...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not
unlike a disembodied FIST.

And, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like -
turning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the
town, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle...


EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT

The car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow -
stops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION
PLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's
stranded - alone.

                           STU
            Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead?
                 (beat)
            PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD.

Off in the fog is a big wheeled CART with the sign: "PSYCHOLOGICAL
BAGGAGE CLAIM." There STU finds two SUITCASES and a BACKPACK. He
examines the TAGS. They all belong to him!

He sits on the edge of the cart, opens a SUITCASE, and pulls out...

 - A bagged copy of Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #1;

 - An 8mm reel of highlights from Ray Harryhausen's Jason and the
   Argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover;

 - A SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, its cover labelled "STU M. - GEOGRAPHY," its
   inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes;

 - Transparent plastic models of "THE VISIBLE MAN" and his mate, "THE
   VISIBLE WOMAN," with a couple of spare organs that young STU never
   quite found a place for;

 - A vinyl LP of "BREAD'S GREATEST HITS," which STU quickly slips back
   into the suitcase lest anyone see it.

As he gathers his bags, he hears odd SQUEAKS and CHITTERING...

                           RACCOON (o.s.)
            Carry your bags, mister?

A STRANGE FURRY CREATURE pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on
STU's pants leg. It looks like a raccoon, but it's FLAT - an animated
pelt. Before STU has time to let out a yell, a FLAT SNAKESKIN comes
slithering out from beneath the baggage cart...

                           SNAKE
            Cigars, mister? Genuine Coobans!

STU looks down and sees a SQUASHED RABBIT humping his leg.

                           RABBIT
            Wanna meet my sister?

These bordertown types are known as ROADKILL, and they're sporting the
tire tracks to prove it. STU SCREAMS, shakes them off, and RUNS.

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

A long stone STAIRWAY leads to decorative wrought-iron GATES. SHADOWY
CARVED SPHINXES sit on either side. As STU races up the steps, a
sputtering NEON SIGN comes to life overhead:

                               D RK TOWN

A FANFARE BLOWS as the creaky gates begin to part. A SPOTLIGHT hits the
SPHINXES - and they COME TO LIFE! They rise up on their hind legs, put
on boater hats. One of them blows a note on a kazoo...

                           SINGING SPHINXES
            Weeee...welcome you to Dark Town
            And while you're in your coma
            This odd amusement park-town
            Will be your Home Sweet Homa -

STU bolts THROUGH THE GATES, with the ROADKILL TRIO right on his heels.
The indignant SPHINXES exchange a look of outrage.

EXT. DARK TOWN - MIDWAY - NIGHT

It's a carny town, a tourist trap, seedy and nightmarish. Despite the
festive trappings, there's something off about it - an air of neglect
and decrepitude - as if they'd tried to turn Alcatraz into Disneyland,
and given up halfway through.

STU looks back and sees the ROADKILL gaining on him. He spots a small
group of OTHER HUMANS...

                           STU
            Help me. Please. There's animals. They -

The humans just YAWN. They're COMA VICTIMS, just like STU. He ditches
one of his SUITCASES as the ROADKILL come after him.

                           VOICE
            Pony ride, Mister?

He turns and spots a helpful-looking fellow in a COWBOY OUTFIT. The
COWBOY is in fact a CENTAUR - rider and mount rolled into one!

The characters who run this place - the BARKERS, TICKET-TAKERS, and RIDE
OPERATORS - are all weird HYBRIDS, part human, part ANIMAL. They could
be the ancient Gods of some primitive culture - reduced to working as
street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town.

STU pinballs down the street, bouncing from one shock to another:

 - JOE CAMEL, doing community service as a STREET SWEEPER -

                           JOE CAMEL
            Hey, Mister. Mister! Got a smoke?

 - a YETI selling SNO-CONES from a cart outside the MORPHEUM THEATRE.
   The marquee reads:

                        LIVE! NIGHTMARES! LIVE!
          First-Run - Continuous Performances - Popular Prices
                Rated NR-H - Not Recommended for Humans

 - A CYCLOPS working as a barker at the Penny Arcade;

 - A VIDEO RENTAL OUTLET - "BAD DREAMS VIDEO," offering your favorite
   nightmares, cult and classic, three nights for $2.95. A THREE-HEADED
   DEVIL emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos - and
   recognizes STU, much to his horror.

                           HEAD #1
            Hey, aren't you Stu Miley?

                           HEAD #2
            We're big fans.

                           HEAD #3
            Could we have your autograph?

Reduced to babbling hysteria, STU ducks into the nearest building. Above
the door, an ANIMATED NEON SIGN shows a happy boozer lifting his martini
glass, then falling over flat on his back, at which point his eyes are
replaced by the traditional cartoon X's. This is the COMA BAR.


INT. COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

STU bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL skitter
past outside. He's given them the slip. He looks around.

The bar's a weird melange of styles. COMA VICTIMS ride around in
wheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS, drinking cocktails from IV
bottler. A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a
MERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of Johnny
Mercer's "DREAM." And over at the BAR...

                           BULL (o.s.)
            New in town, huh? What're you drinking?

Out of breath, STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER, BULL, turns
away to grab a fresh glass.

                           STU
            Chasing me - animals - horrible -

                           BULL
            Animals? What kind of animals?

STU GAGS. BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR, body of a man, head of a
BULL. His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side.

                           BULL
            Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's
            what everybody says - although personally, I
            don't see the resemblance. What are you
            drinking?

                           STU
            Uhh - martini?

                           BULL
            Olive or eyeball?

                           STU
            Olive. - Where exactly am I?

                           BULL
            Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.

                           STU
            Stu Miley.

                           BULL
            Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're
            quite a celebrity down here.

STU gives him a cockeyed look. BULL points to a MONITOR mounted over the
bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot
through a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES.

                           BULL
            I told you, it's the land of nightmares. Same on
            every channel...all the stuff people dream,
            after they have the extra anchovies.

He changes channels with a remote. Now we see a guy falling through
midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling...

                           STU
            Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.

                           BULL
            Sad commentary, huh?

Now a small muffled VOICE speaks from the area of STU'S BACKPACK:

                           DISEMBODIED VOICE (o.s.)
            "Bull," huh? That's cute. What's your last name
            - "Shit"??

                           BULL
                 (turning angrily to STU)
            I beg your pardon?

                           STU
            I didn't say anything.

                           VOICE (o.s.)
            Nice face. Lemme guess. You were in a bullfight
            ...with a Mack Truck!!

STU claps both hands over his mouth to prove he's not the one talking.
BULL glowers at him, snorting STEAM out of both nostrils.

                           STU
            I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...

                           BULL
            Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist
            here.

The ELEPHANT GOD from the Wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over.

                           VOICE (o.s.)
            Well, hello, sailor. Get a lot of dates with
            that ding-dong on your face??

BULL and JUMBO rear back to PUNCH STU'S LIGHTS OUT. He's saying his
prayers when his BACKPACK begins to BULGE and QUIVER - and a SMALL FURRY
BEAST pops out, CACKLING HIS HEAD OFF!!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Just kiddin', folks! Drinks for everybody -
                 (pointing at STU)

            On him!! HIYA, BOSS!!

BULL and JUMBO back off, STUNNED. The monkey grabs STU'S FACE and plants
a big wet SMOOCH right on his NOSE. STU SCREAMS.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON an EEG monitor. There's a sudden BLIP on the readout.

                           NURSE
            Just a spike, ma'am. It happens. It's perfectly
            natural with coma patients.

                           JULIE
            I'm a doctor too. I know this man's brain -

JULIE strokes STU's limp hand. He's COMATOSE, cocooned in a tangle of
wires and tubes. His head and shoulders are heavily bandaged. He's
hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room.

                           DOCTOR
            Go home, Doctor. Rest. Come back when you can do
            us some good.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Dead on her feet, JULIE stumbles toward the exit. As she's leaving she
passes the WAITING ROOM -

                           WOMAN'S VOICE
            Julie?

She turns and sees an older colleague from work - ALICE - waiting in the
doorway. Hovering right behind ALICE is HERB. And behind him -

It appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of JULIE
and STU's. Disheveled and groggy, they rouse themselves and make their
way over to JULIE's side. She's overcome with emotion.

INT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

The sound of the key in the lock is met by INSANE BARKING. JULIE and
ALICE enter and are met by BUSTER, the pet basset - jumping and yipping
like crazy after 24 hours without food or human company.

                           ALICE
            Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.

                           JULIE
            Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and
            a half. Let me get some food...

ALICE kneels to play with the dog. She hears a sudden GASP from the
kitchen. JULIE is standing by the open refrigerator, wearing an
absolutely stricken expression...

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

ALICE finds JULIE holding a bottle of champagne - Veuve Clicquot La
Grande Dame 1989 - all wrapped up in a bow and ribbon.

                           ALICE
            Special occasion?

                           JULIE
            I don't know. I guess it was...

She bursts into tears. ALICE sits her down at the kitchen table and
takes the champagne from her.

                           ALICE
            Don't get all poignant. We're keeping this
            bottle on ice. When he comes around you're going
            to need it.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT

A limp JULIE soaking in a steamy tub, one arm dangling over the side. On
the vanity is a framed PHOTO STRIP, four poses for a dollar. In the
first three, STU and JULIE are making outrageously goony faces. In the
fourth, they imitate the stern-faced farm couple from American Gothic.

She gazes at it for a long, long time. Eventually she smiles.

INT. SECOND BEDROOM/STUDIO - NIGHT

OPEN on two PHOTOS, mounted in a single frame. On the left, BUSTER
KEATON, droopy-eyed, in his familiar porkpie hat and vest. On the right,
a Photoshopped image of BUSTER THE BASSETT HOUND, in the same pose, also
wearing Keaton's hat and vest.

These photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as STU's
studio and JULIE's office. MONKEYBONE STRIPS are scattered across the
drafting table. ALICE is making up the sofa as a guest bed.

As she's hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an ACRYLIC
CANVAS in the back, stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full
of spiral-bound sketchbooks. She pulls it out. She's obviously disturbed
by it, but she can't tear her eyes away...

She's still gaping at the painting when JULIE enters in a terrycloth
robe.

                           ALICE
            Who did this?

                           JULIE
            Stu. That was right about the time we met.

                           ALICE
            When he first came in to the sleep lab?

                           JULIE
            Yeah...before your time.

The canvas depicts a group of SURGEONS with the faces of wolves. They're
standing over a HUMAN PATIENT, replacing his internal organs with
MACHINE PARTS. The style is at once cartoony and unsettling.

                           ALICE
            Jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing
            him, but I never realized what you cured him
            from.

                           JULIE
            He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years.
            The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start
            right in painting...
                 (chuckling)

            That boy looked like pluperfect hell.

ALICE's gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the MONKEYBONE strips
tacked up over the drafting table.

                           ALICE
            How do you get from here - to there?

                           JULIE
            Switch hands.

                           ALICE
            What?

                           JULIE
            I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction -
            right brain and left brain out of balance. He
            was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil
            to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.

A smile comes to JULIE's face. She settles in on the floor beside ALICE
and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a
quickie CARTOON on the back of a napkin - the prototype for...

                           ALICE
            Monkeybone?

                           JULIE
            Left-handed, he was funny. He'd been doing all
            this scary, intense work...then he found out he
            could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he
            liked that.
                 (shrugging)
            And then the nightmares just...stopped.

                           ALICE
            Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one
            did you fall in love with?

JULIE smiles at the cartoon. She isn't telling.

                           JULIE
            I've put a ton of work into that boy, Alice. I
            am not going to let him get away from me.

INT. ICU - MORNING

JULIE, in her white lab coat, wanders through Intensive Care and finds a
WOMAN hunched over STU's bed, BAWLING HER EYES OUT.

                           JULIE
            Kimmy...?

KIMMY looks up. She's crying so much she can barely recognize JULIE.

                           KIMMY
            Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby
            brother...

                           JULIE
            When'd you get in?

                           KIMMY
            An hour ago.
                 (gathering herself)
            I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he
            would be like, like this. I can't even bear to
            look at him... How about you? You're okay?

                           JULIE
            I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.

                           KIMMY
            I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At
            least he had a chance to give you the ring.

                           JULIE
            The ring...

                           KIMMY
            Grandmama's ring. The engagement ring. He asked
            me to send it to him -

JULIE turns to look at STU in the bed. The certain knowledge that he was
about to propose is like a knife in her heart. KIMMY feels bad as well,
having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out -

                           VOICE FROM BEHIND
            Mrs. Brewster? Julie? I'm Dr. Edelstein.

Cheery DR. EDELSTEIN enters. He shakes hands with the women, then checks
STU's readouts, making notations on his clipboard.

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.

                           KIMMY
            Can you give us a realistic sense of my
            brother's chances?

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait
            and see.

                           KIMMY
            But these...machines are what's keeping him
            alive, is that right?

This remark sends a shiver down JULIE's spine, but she keeps silent.

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            At the moment, yes.

                           KIMMY
            Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long
            this is going to last?

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today,
            tomorrow, a month from now...

                           KIMMY
            Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr.
            Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of
            doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

                           JULIE
            Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He
            doesn't even know he's in a -

                           KIMMY
            Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our
            father took a long time to die. A long time. It
            just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a
            pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let
            it drag out.

                           JULIE
            It's too soon even to - talk about that!

                           KIMMY
            Give me a date, Doctor.

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            Three months.
                 (pause)

            There's always some brain damage. But at three
            months...the chances of coming back shrink
            dramatically with every day.

                           KIMMY
            I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can
            certainly give it...three months.

No one says anything. But both women look at STU, and then at each
other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands. JULIE has
a sinking feeling that STU is working on a 3-month deadline.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

A beauty pageant - shapely INGENUES in EVENING GOWNS being introduced by
an EMCEE with enormous teeth.

                           EMCEE
            And now the last of our five finalists...Miss
            Michigan...GEORGE T. WILLOUGHBY!

GEORGE is a pudgy shmoe with a small pencil mustache who's wearing
glasses, a necktie, and NOTHING ELSE. He steps forward, holding a
briefcase in front of his crotch, looking EXTREMELY MORTIFIED.

                           EMCEE
            And now George will give us his analysis of
            Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle as it
            pertains to third-world economics!!

CAMERA PULLS BACK - and we realize we're in:

INT. COMA BAR - NIGHT

where BULL the BARTENDER and a number of PATRONS are watching GEORGE's
nightmare on the TV mounted over the bar.

Onscreen, NUDE GEORGE is sweating bullets. He has no idea what to say,
and the audience is beginning to laugh at him. In a desperate, feeble
attempt to buy time...he begins to SING.

                           GEORGE
            I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair!

In fact he goes into a little softshoe, keeping the briefcase poised
over his crotch. Unfortunately, THE CASE POPS OPEN, dumping frilly
LINGERIE all over the stage. The weeping GEORGE must crawl around on all
fours to retrieve it...

By now the onlookers at the bar are CRACKING UP. All except one - the
lonely, disconsolate fellow on the last stool, nursing a martini - STU.

                           BULL
            Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good
            humiliation nightmare.

                           STU
            Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three
            months since the accident - and I'm no closer to
            going home than I was then.

                           BULL
            Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.

                           STU
            I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting,
            and the carnival rides, and watching people's
            nightmares. And of course, I need not add -

He GRIMACES at MONKEYBONE, who's stretched out atop the mighty Wurlitzer
at the other end of the room. The MERMAID CHANTEUSE is singing a
Dietrich number, "The Laziest Gal in Town" - or at least trying to,
because MONKEYBONE is caterwauling behind her. By the time she gets to
the grand finale, he's practically BAYING AT THE MOON.

Pissed off, she SHAKES her FIST at MONKEYBONE and pulls the lid of her
clamshell SHUT. This suits MONKEYBONE just fine, as it leaves him alone
in the spotlight to soak up what little applause there is.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Thank you, thank you for that very modest

            response. I know you're all in comas, but still.
            And now...it's dedication time!

He gestures to JUMBO, the elephant organist, who begins to vamp.

                           MONKEYBONE
            We've got a special dedication tonight. This
            one's from my ever-lovin' boss, Mr. Stu Mopey -
            I mean Miley - and we're sendin' it up to
            a very special lady in the land of the living.
            Yes, I do mean Julie - the beautiful Miss Julie
            - who, if she has a brain in her head, is
            shacked up right now with some good-lookin' doc
            she met in the E.R.!
                 (pointing at STU)
            JUST KIDDING, BUDDY! Because if we know anything
            about Miss Julie, we know she is faithful,
            loyal, and true. Even if her boyfriend is an
            eggplant. Which is why we're dedicating...this
            very special tune...to her. Jumbo?

JUMBO's tasteful vamping gives way to a RAUNCHY ROCK BEAT - and
MONKEYBONE begins STRUTTING across the top of the piano, bumping and
grinding and shaking his booty to the tune of -

                           MONKEYBONE
            MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH!
            MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH!

MONKEYBONE sings the same poignant line over and over until STU comes
storming over from the bar and YANKS HIM off the Wurlitzer by the scruff
of his scrawny NECK.

A trouper to the end, MONKEYBONE WAVES at the crowd even as STU drags
him off to an empty table in the farthest corner of the room.

                           STU
            You have humiliated me in public for the last

            time.

                           MONKEYBONE
            I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm
            just a figment of your imagination.

                           STU
            Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a
            masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me.

                           STU
            I am not. And I don't gotta.

MONKEYBONE waves and winks at every female who passes by. STU whacks him
upside the head.

                           MONKEYBONE
            You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could
            both be gettin' some o' this fine local action.
            It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town,
            under five minutes, and in a coma don't count.

                           STU
            Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of
            them aren't even my species.

Cocktail waitress KITTY, a seven-foot cat-faced feline sex bomb, arrives
in her skimpy black dress and shows STU a Cheshire-cat grin. MONKEYBONE
reclines, Odalisque-style, on the table.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Hellooooooooo, Kitty.

                           KITTY
            Hiya, Stu. Refill on that martini?

                           MONKEYBONE
            I'd like something with an umbrella in it and a
            really smutty name. Like a...Sex Behind the Sofa
            with Your Parents in the Same Room Watching "The
            Brady Bunch."

                           STU
            Nothing for him! He's being repressed.

                           KITTY
            Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just
            wishin' he was me.

                           STU
            I've been trying to get through to the head guy
            - the nightmare god - what's his name?

                           KITTY
            Hypnos?

                           STU
            Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I
            wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think
            I'll never see her again.

A softie at heart, KITTY sits across from STU and takes his hand.

                           STU
            I shoulda proposed, Kitty. That way at least
            she'd know how I feel. That way she'd...wait for
            me.

She leans forward sympathetically. From this particular vantage,
MONKEYBONE has an unobstructed view of KITTY's cleavage. And so does STU
- although he's not quite as obvious about staring.

                           KITTY
            She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is. Guys
            like you don't come along that often. Believe
            me, I know.

MONKEYBONE slinks over behind STU - up onto his shoulder - and whispers
into his ear:

                           MONKEYBONE
            My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us
            boldly go where no man has gone before.

                           STU
                 (trying to ignore him)

            I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?

                           KITTY
            I mean it, Stu. You're one in a million.

KITTY is holding the cleavage pose for an unnaturally long time. Her
furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air. It's
hypnotic - like a windshield wiper.

STU stares at it. MONKEYBONE stares at it. And MONKEYBONE'S TAIL
responds by straightening...stiffening...bending upward slightly.

                           STU
            I'm not so special. I'm just - kind of -

STU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his
shoulder. It's a TONGUE...dangling out of MONKEYBONE'S OPEN MOUTH. STU
lets out a YOWL OF SHOCK.

Blushing bright red, he GRABS THE TONGUE and shoves it manually back
into the monkey mouth whence it came.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done
            the same if you had the equipment!

                           STU
            THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!

                           MONKEYBONE
            FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -

STU LUNGES at MONKEYBONE - who JUMPS OVER HIM, BOUNDS off the edge of
the table, and grabs hold of a CHANDELIER.

                           MONKEYBONE
            I'm reportin' this to my union!!

                           STU
            What union?

                           MONKEYBONE
            The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the
            Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your
            ass!

STU grabs a CHAIR and swings it at the chandelier. MONKEYBONE makes a
series of SUBMARINE NOISES -

                           MONKEYBONE
            DIVE! DIVE!!

- and DIVES - directly between KITTY's breasts into her skimpy black
dress!! STU circles around KITTY, following the undulating monkey-sized
BLOB that's tunnelling around under her dress. Finally MONKEYBONE pops
out of the BACK of the dress and NUZZLES KITTY'S EAR:

                           MONKEYBONE
            I left my phone number in your undies. Try not
            to lose it in traffic.

                           STU
            Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke
            my monkey.

MONKEYBONE runs under the pool table. STU is giving chase when -
suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.

EVERYONE IN THE BAR freezes in place.

For there, in the doorway, is a looming, ominous figure - the most
dreaded figure in all of Dark Town -

- a GRIM REAPER, nine feet tall and swinging a scythe, come to take some
hapless coma victim to the land of Death!

EERIE WINDS WHISTLE and the shroud FLUTTERS in the night breeze as the
REAPER looks from face to face. For a moment he focuses on STU. STU
backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread...and
MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.

But the REAPER moves on - past each COMA VICTIM in turn - finally
STOPPING in front of a TINY, WIZENED, PRUNELIKE OLD GENT in a
wheelchair, who looks to be 110 years old at least.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Him. Whew. About time!

                           REAPER
            EARL BIEGLER. I'VE COME -

                           EARL
            Can't hear you, young fellow. Speak up!

                           REAPER
            EARL BIEGLER, I'VE COME TO GIVE YOU - aw, hell.
            Here.

GASPS OF ANTICIPATION all around the room as the REAPER hands EARL a
long white ENVELOPE. EARL opens it slowly and removes...

...an oversized rectangular TICKET...the size of a Hershey bar, made of
SOLID GOLD, with the letter "E" stamped upon it.

VARIOUS CHARACTERS around the barroom react, in hushed voices:

                           BULL
            An E-Ticket!

                           PATRON
            He got a reprieve.

                           KITTY
            Good for him! He's gonna wake up!

EARL throws his crutches aside, jumps out of his chair, and DANCES A
JIG, waving the ticket over his head. STU stares at him with naked envy.

                           STU
            No. No. Not him.

                           EARL
            So long, suckers! See you in the funny papers!

EARL does an end-zone dance toward the door. One by one, OTHER PATRONS
get up from their seats to watch EARL's departure.


EXT. COMA BAR - STREETS - NIGHT

The COMA VICTIMS shuffle toward a BIG RIDE across the midway.

It's a "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine - the kind where you slam down a
mallet and try to ring the bell. It's surrounded by crocodile moats and
storm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading PRIVATE
- NO ADMITTANCE.

EARL, still jubilant, inserts his E-ticket into a receptacle at the
entrance. A DRAWBRIDGE LOWERS, and CAROUSEL MUSIC cranks up, and
CARNIVAL LIGHTS blink on, and FIREWORKS rocket into the sky...

All around them, faces turn skyward. CLOUDS are parting. An EDDY of
swirling colors is forming DIRECTLY ABOVE the E-ticket ride - and a
PINPOINT HOLE opens up at its center.

The "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine has been outfitted with a SEAT where
the bell-ringer should be. Once EARL has settled in, a GIANT MECHANICAL
MAN lifts its enormous mallet...

...and SLAMS IT DOWN on the lever end of the machine, sending EARL
ROCKETING UPWARD toward the hole in the sky. DING!! The SEAT hits the
BELL, but EARL keeps going - up - up - UP...

Then, with a distinct POP, he's gone. Over the rainbow...home.

                           STU
            He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How
            come he goes back and I stay here?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?

                           STU
                 (turning abruptly)
            HEY!! HEY, YOU!!

STU marches across the street to the GRIM REAPER - who's climbing onto
his WINGED BICYCLE and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat with
him. MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.

                           STU
            He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get

            to wake up??

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.

                           STU
            I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody
            had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna
            - I'm gonna kick ass!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.

MONKEYBONE practically swoons. But the REAPER just stares at STU:

                           REAPER
            SORRY, BUD. OFF-DUTY.

The REAPER climbs onto his winged bike and PEDALS OFF down the midway.
STU lets out a HOWL OF FRUSTRATION.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu? Stu? Let's calm down, talk things over. How
            about some comedy relief? Okay. Brontosaurus
            walks into a gay bar...

STU BOOTS MONKEYBONE aside. They're at a GAME STALL manned by Elsie the
Cow - the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles. STU picks up a
baseball and HURLS IT at the departing REAPER.

The ball hits the REAPER smack on the head, knocking him off his bike!

                           STU/MONKEYBONE
                 (in unison - impressed)
            Damn.

MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.
But STU isn't intimidated. He grabs another ball and winds up.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu? Stu? I think weve got this backwards. Your
            behavior...is disturbing me.

The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as
the ball whizzes past. STU starts chasing after him!

The REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one of
the "fingers" of the hand that holds Dark Town. When the bike hits the
end of the finger, it TAKES OFF into the void and KEEPS ON GOING.

                           STU
            That's right. Run! And don't come back unless
            you've got my e-ticket!!

The REAPER vanishes. STU sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb.

                           STU
            Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get out of
            here. I'll never see her again.

Just then, a multi-armed MESSENGER BOY in royal livery toodles past on a
CHILD'S SCOOTER. He stops...

                           MESSENGER BOY
            Miley? Stu Miley?

STU looks up. Six arms reach into six pockets. Finally the MESSENGER
finds an ENVELOPE and hands it over. Inside is an ENGRAVED INVITATION:

                          YOU Are Invited to a
                              PAJAMA PARTY
                          at HYPNOS' HIDEAWAY
                     Penthouse Suite - 10 PM Sharp
                       "If You Snooze, You Lose"

STU'S EYES widen with excitement as the MESSENGER scoots off.

                           STU
            Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what
            this means, Monkeybone? He's finally going to
            hear my case. I'm going home!

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - MORNING

As she's done every morning for the last three months, JULIE brushes
STU'S TEETH. Although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we
saw her last, she always affects a cheerful manner around STU - on the
off chance that he might be aware of her presence.

She packs the toothbrush away, runs a hand along his stubbly cheek.

                           JULIE
            I think we can go another day without shaving.
            Long as you don't look like you're growing one
            of those stupid little goatees.

She opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper.

                           JULIE
            Hey, there's an article about the Monkeybone
            show. They've run that one episode about eight
            times now. Herb says it gets higher ratings
            every time...they're hoping you'll give 'em some
            new material soon...
                 (long, bored pause)
            Wanna hear another joke?

She refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback
entitled The Book of Raunch. She pages through it for a moment.

                           JULIE
            Okay...let me see...here we go. A plane full of
            explorers crashlands in New Guinea; they are
            captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the
            chief's hut, where...wait a minute. I know this
            one...
                 (reading ahead)

            You stinker! You swiped this joke for a
            Monkeybone strip!

She whacks him on the arm with the book. No response at all.

                           JULIE
            Okay. Let's try again. Why did the pervert cross
            the road?

The sound of SOBBING interrupts her joke. She looks up and sees KIMMY
standing in the doorway, red-eyed and crying.

                           JULIE
            Kimmy! What's the matter?

                           KIMMY
            This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but
            it's been three months now, and...
                 (long pause)
            I gave the order.

JULIE just stares at her for a beat or two, refusing to understand. Then
it sinks in. Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.

                                            FADE THROUGH TO:

EXT. HYPNOSPIRE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS up the seemingly endless length of the HYPNOSPIRE - up,
up, THROUGH a heavy layer of clouds, to the ROTATING PENTHOUSE DOME of
the building...

...which is festooned with oodles of 18-INCH DSS SATELLITE DISHES.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

ELEVATOR DOORS open, and we glide into the swank, swingin', space-age
bachelor pad of HYPNOS, God of Sleep. A giant flying CUPID welcomes us,
tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft.

HYP'S HIDEAWAY occupies the entire penthouse floor, and there's always a
party in full effect. A rotating disco ball flashes colored light on
walls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic OP-ART PATTERNS.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Now this...is livin'.

Of course, a party needs party animals - and the DARKTOWNERS on the
scene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor. DJ
SLEEPY ZZZ'S has three turntables spinning at once.

As STU wanders through, he gets a big surprise. Reproductions of his old
NIGHTMARE PAINTINGS are hanging on the walls! They've been turned into
ONE-SHEETS for the coming attractions at the Morpheum.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can
            paint better than that.

                           STU
            Like you'd know. You started out on the back of
            a napkin, you little...doodle.

Scowling at each other, the boys turn their backs and part ways. We
follow MONKEYBONE to the wet bar, where he almost immediately bumps into
a statuesque GORGON with a full head of writhing SNAKES.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Hey! Like the do. So tell me, are you a, uhh...
            natural snakehead?

                           GORGON
            Only fifty dollars to find out.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Fifty dollars?! Bite me!

                           GORGON
            You got it, big boy.

He grins and shrugs: what the hell. As they head for a back room, the
BARTENDER hands him a SNAKEBITE KIT.

A look of apprehension crosses MONKEYBONE's face. But before he can
change his mind, the GORGON'S HAND yanks him out of frame.

STU, meanwhile, is crossing the dance floor, moving among glittering
animal-people who DANCE in their bizarre, uninhibited way. A FIVE-LEGGED
WOMAN - the bottom half of her body a big human HAND - SMILES at STU as
he passes. He tries to talk to her, but she's dancing, and with five
constantly moving legs it's difficult to get in close.

                           STU
            Say, have you seen Mr. Hypnos?

                           HAND WOMAN
            Hyp? He was here a while ago. Aren't you Stu
            Miley? The nightmare guy?

STU grins meekly, nods yes. She pulls him over to dance.

                           HAND WOMAN
            I heard you were going to be here tonight. This
            is so cool!

JUMBO the ELEPHANT GOD is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby. His trunk
swings out and hits one of the HAND WOMAN'S arms - which SNAPS OFF like
marble statuary. Before she can let out a squeal, he does it again. Now
she's armless - a regular Venus de Milo!

                           HAND WOMAN
            You fat slob! Watch what you're doing!

                           JUMBO
            Why don't you slap me? Go on, slap me!

                           HAND WOMAN
            Come on, Stu. Let's go where the real fun is.

She leads him over to the sunken living room. Among the other guests, we
see a CYCLOPS, a YETI, a BBQ PIG. A number of sofas and lounge chairs
are arranged around a big crystal ORB in the center of the room.

The ORB is where nightmares happen. Although the perspective shifts and
the locales change abruptly, as in a movie, all the nightmares have a
3-D quality - as if they're taking place right here in the room with us!

                           STU
            Wow. Live feed, huh?

                           HAND WOMAN
            You bet. Hyp gets all the best stuff before it
            goes out to the theatres.

STU grins in anticipation. He finds an empty chair and starts to sit
down - but there's a SLUG with a MAN'S HEAD already in it!

                           SLUG WITH A MAN'S HEAD
            HEY!

                           STU
            Sorry.

STU picks another seat. The HAND WOMAN sidles up alongside him.

                           HAND WOMAN
            Shh! There's a new one just starting.


EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB)

In long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints.
Emerging from a sylvan glade, they kiss in golden sunlight. Then the MAN
breaks free - sprints through knee-high sunflowers to the middle of the
field, where a picnic blanket is waiting.

CLOSEUP - STU

HIS FACE GOES PALE as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt.

                           STU
            That - that's me.

                           CYCLOPS
            Nice shirt, dude!

EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

Paisley-shirted STU pours champagne for two. Toasts his beloved - who
is, of course, JULIE, the dreamer of the dream.

He pulls out a little velvet RING BOX and offers it to her. But when she
tries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and STEALS A KISS.

Suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together
through the flowers, LAUGHING, full of joy.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of
horrors to come. STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his
heart pounding with dread.

                           STU
            What is this? Who's dreaming this??
                 (beat)
            Julie??

                           YETI
            Hey, keep it down!

EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

JULIE rolls onto her back on the grass, FACE AGLOW. Only to realize...
that STU IS NO LONGER THERE BESIDE HER.

She looks around. Gets to her feet. Turns. And the BACKGROUND behind her
MORPHS suddenly into...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)

The room is decorated for a FAREWELL PARTY, complete with streamers and
confetti. KIMMY, DR. EDELSTEIN, various MEDICAL PERSONNEL and FRIENDS
are wearing party hats, lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the
guest of honor...the comatose Stu!

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

The DARKTOWNERS clustered around the orb can barely conceal their animal
excitement. It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more
than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral
charge from the spectacle of human terror.

                           STU
            JULIE!!

He tries to push his way forward to the orb. An angry CYCLOPS elbows him
aside. A YETI grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way.

                           HAND WOMAN
            Stu!! What are you doing? Chill out!!

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)

COMATOSE STU stands in the center of the room, UPRIGHT and IMMOBILE in a
party hat. A weird UMBILICAL CORD extends from his navel to a huge
groaning BELLOWS DEVICE - like an artificial lung, it's all that keeps
him breathing.

EDELSTEIN hands a pair of OVERSIZED CEREMONIAL SCISSORS to KIMMY, and
she CUTS THE CORD, as if opening a new mall. Applause all around. JULIE
races toward STU in slo-mo, SHRIEKING -

- as he DEFLATES into a LIMP PUDDLE OF FLESH before her eyes!!

                           JULIE
            No. No. STU!

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - ON STU

JULIE's distress is killing him. Yet all around him, DARKTOWNERS are
cackling their heads off, growling, howling, punching their fists in the
air like rowdy drunks at a football game. He LOSES IT ALTOGETHER.

                           STU
            JULIE! I'M HERE, DOC! DON'T LET THEM PULL THE
            PLUG! I'M HERE!!!

He won't be stopped this time. He makes for the orb - climbing over
sofas, pushing guests aside, knocking over their drinks -

                           CYCLOPS
            HEY! Watch it, you stinkin' gringo -

                           STU
            JULIE! I'M HERE! I LOVE YOU!

Somehow, JULIE has heard him!! Down in the nightmare orb, her dream self
is looking UP, trying to locate the source of STU's disembodied voice!
He struggles to reach the orb, but the CYCLOPS is holding him back.

                           JULIE
            Stu? STU...?

STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a
haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare. JULIE's image
vanishes - and STU gropes at the air, DESPAIRING.

INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

The real JULIE awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own.

                           JULIE
            STU!!!!

Only now does she realize where she is. She's fallen asleep in the
visitor's chair next to STU's bed. The clock on the wall reads 1:15 AM.

STU'S READOUTS are spiking like crazy.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

STU is being dragged across the dance floor by the YETI and JUMBO THE
ELEPHANT GOD. HAND WOMAN brings up the rear.

                           JUMBO
            Who invited this schmuck, anyway?

                           HAND WOMAN
            Oh, it's my fault. I thought he was cooler than
            that.

                           STU
            Listen. Please. It's my girlfriend. I've gotta
            get a message to her...

But just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams...

                           WOMAN'S VOICE
            HYP!!!

A WALL PANEL does a 180-degree turn, and a CIRCULAR BED rotates into the
room. Languishing atop it, garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches
the black & white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread...

...is a CHUBBY, GRINNING, SLEEPY-EYED SATYR, with horns and hooves. TWO
WASP WOMEN are with him on the bed, brushing his furry goat legs and
feeding him grapes.

As STU fights his way over, he sees an odd LUMP wriggling under the
bedcovers. Out pops MONKEYBONE, clutching a bottle of champagne!

                           MONKEYBONE
            I knew I left it in there somewhere.

He shakes the bottle, pops the cork, and SPRAYS SPURTING BUBBLY at
HYPNOS, the GIRLS, and everyone else within firing range!

                           HYPNOS
            Haw! I like a monkey with vision!

                           MONKEYBONE
            You said it, partner!

Hilarity all around. STU snatches MONKEYBONE off the bed -

                           STU
            How'd you get in there?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu... It's a party.

                           STU
            Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -

                           HYPNOS
            Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls
            ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the house!
                 (leading a round of applause)

            This is an honor. We see a lot of nightmares
            down here, but yours are like caviar, man. You
            da shits!!

                           STU
            Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was
            having it. She dreamed they were pulling the
            plug on me. She was watching me die.

                           HYPNOS
            Uh huh. And?

                           STU
            Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to
            let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of
            here...

A vaguely embarrassed look crosses HYPNOS's face. All the nearby
DARKTOWNERS stare at their shoes, clear their throats.

                           STU
            ...which is actually what I wanted to talk to
            you about. See, I've been here three months -

With a brusque gesture, HYPNOS sends the party girls packing. He slings
one arm around STU's shoulder and pulls him aside.

                           HYPNOS
            Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?

                           STU
            Tell me what?

                           HYPNOS
            It's a special kind of party. A farewell party.
            Do you...get what I'm saying?

                           STU
            Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -

STU EXPLODES WITH JOY. He practically dances a jig.

                           STU
            I'M GOING HOME! I'M WAKING UP! HEY, EVERYBODY!
            I'M OUTTA HERE. I...

One by one, the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away.

                           STU
            I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or
            don't I get to... Is there some...

                           HYPNOS
            Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this
            pact with your sister...no life support?

MONKEYBONE's jaw drops. He slaps himself across the forehead.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??

                           STU
            Well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. It was
            different then. I was depressed. My life is
            great now. I'm in love!

MONKEYBONE marches back and forth across the bed, wearing a dimwit's
expression as he MOCKS STU in a singsongy voice...

                           MONKEYBONE
            Pull the plug! Pull the plug! Take my organs! I
            don't need 'em! I don't need no! Life support!
            I'm an idiot! Pull the pl--

STU grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth.

                           STU
            Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...

                           HYPNOS
            Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide.
            That's why she was having the nightmare.
                 (an embarrassed shrug)

            They're pulling the plug at nine AM.

                           STU
            Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours.

In checking his watch, STU removes his hand from MONKEYBONE's mouth. The
singsong resumes...

                           MONKEYBONE
            I'm so dumb! I deserve to die -

                           STU
            Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you.
            There's gotta be something I can do.

                           HYPNOS
            Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work,
            but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's
            bailiwick.

                           STU
            Maybe you could talk to Death!

                           HYPNOS
            Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will
            be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before
            I go crawling to that piece of -

HYP shuts up. Looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being
overheard. Then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed.

They climb aboard eagerly. HYPNOS hits his remote...

INT. HYPNOS'S BEDROOM - ON BED

...and they rotate AWAY from the party. Privacy at last.

                           HYPNOS
            Now Death is not what you would call a people
            person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should
            know. I'm his little brother.

                           STU
            You're Death's brother?

                           HYPNOS
            Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My-
            Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the
            course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired
            of that schtick.
                 (spreading his hands)

            So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down
            amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it.
            I'm supposed to be grateful?

                           MONKEYBONE
            The penthouse is pretty swank, though.

                           HYPNOS
            Thank you. I decorated it myself.

                           STU
            Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have
            eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...

                           HYPNOS
            Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you
            might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled
            it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there
            was that other guy who...well, very few people
            have done it.

                           STU
            Hyp, I'll do anything.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Me too. And I mean anything. Ask the chicks in
            the back room.

                           HYPNOS
            You've seen those E-tickets, right? Well, what
            you gotta do...is go into the Land of Death...
            and steal an E-ticket right out from under
            Death's nose.

                           STU
            Land of Death. How do I get there?

                           HYPNOS
            Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you
            didn't hear it from me.

HYP hits the remote. The bed begins to ROTATE OUTWARD again.

                           HYPNOS
            You've heard of a fate worse than Death? That's
            what's waiting for you if you screw up.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - A MOMENT LATER

HYP gives the boys a wink and a thumbs-up, then wanders off to shmooze
his other guests. MONKEYBONE shakes STU's hand.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real,
            boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY
            HERE NEED A FIGMENT?

                           STU
            Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the
            land of Death alone.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu, you have my absolute confidence. ­- DEAD
            MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!

                           STU
                 (grabbing him by the throat)
            I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and
            I'm gonna take it - with or without you.

He turns and stalks off. MONKEYBONE stands there blinking.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?

                           STU
            No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

Stunned, MONKEYBONE scurries along behind him, PLEADING.

                           MONKEYBONE
            You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on
            your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick.
            For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter -
                 (wrapping himself around STU's leg)
            It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death!
            Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!

                           STU
            All right. You can come.

                           MONKEYBONE
            OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH--
                 (suddenly realizing)
            Something went very, very wrong here.

                           STU
            Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.

As if in reply, a PALE, SPECTRAL PRESENCE comes drifting across the
dance floor - an eight-foot-tall GRIM REAPER.

The boys duck behind a POTTED PLANT to watch as he zeroes in on the WET
BAR - where a beautiful coma victim, LULU, is drunkenly making out with
another sloshed corpse-to-be, FRED.

                           REAPER
            LULU LA RUE. I HAVE COME FOR YOU.

LULU doesn't notice. She continues grappling with FRED. Muttering, the
REAPER dives in and tries to disentangle them.

                           REAPER
            LULU LA RUE, I HAVE COME FOR -

                           LULU
            Shay, you're kinda cute.

She ditches FRED and throws her arms around the REAPER. Repulsed, he
pushes her away, props her against the nearest wall -

- and TOUCHES HER with one bony finger above the heart! It's like
throwing a switch. Her body stiffens. Her EYES cross. Her TONGUE droops
out of her mouth. She makes a noise like a DIAL TONE.

The true horror of death is that it makes you look like a total idiot.
The REAPER pulls a collapsible HAND TRUCK from beneath his shroud and
starts maneuvering LULU onto it.

                           FRED
            Say there. How 'bout one for the road?

The REAPER ignores him. FRED holds up a cocktail glass.

                           FRED
            Hold this for me, pally.

The REAPER heaves a sigh and takes the cocktail glass. FRED grabs a
pitcher filled with some luminescent tropical concoction...

...and POURS IT down the REAPER's front!

                           FRED
            Ooopsy daisy.


ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - BEHIND THE PLANT

WINCING at the REAPER in his sopping wet, pink-stained shroud.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Is that what they call "death with dignity"?

The REAPER wrings out his shroud and grabs the hand truck. As he wheels
LULU past the boys, MONKEYBONE pops up with a helpful hint:

                           MONKEYBONE
            Two words for you, my friend: club soda.

STU claps a hand over MB's mouth as the REAPER turns down a hall.

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

The still-muttering REAPER wheels LULU toward the entrance to Dark Town.
The boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance.

                           STU
            He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So
            all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride!
                 (beat)
            Stop shaking! I'll protect you.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Oh, sure. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be
            Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?

The REAPER approaches the GATES. He presses a remote-control BEEPER and
the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass
through.

STU realizes they've only got an instant to make their move. He DIVES
through the gates at top speed. As soon as he's on the other side, he
hears a nasty CLANG behind him...

MONKEYBONE is caught - his body contorted like a pretzel, woven in and
out among the meshing teeth! STU gives him a good hard YANK, and he
slips out like a strand of fettuccine.

They hear RUMBLING on the tracks outside. A CAR is arriving!

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

The REAPER loads LULU into the little roller-coaster and climbs aboard.
The car begins to move. STU and MONKEYBONE get there just in time to
jump onto the LUGGAGE RACK in the back!

ON ROLLER-COASTER - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

They peep over the back of the car at the REAPER and wonder what to do
next. MONKEYBONE spies a TOOL KIT mounted under the rack - opens it, and
pulls out a big, nasty MONKEYWRENCH.

The boys nod in agreement. MONKEYBONE clambers over the back of the car
and hoists the wrench. STU covers his eyes. WHANG!

STU looks up - sees a confused MONKEYBONE alone in the car with LULU.
Now he clambers into the car as well.

                           STU
            Where'd he go??

                           MONKEYBONE
            I don't know.

There's no trace of the REAPER - except for a rumpled shroud, a
wristwatch, and a St. Christopher's medal on the floor of the car. The
boys exchange a puzzled shrug. MONKEYBONE tries on the watch.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SLEEP LAB - PRE-DAWN

The wall clock says it's not quite 3 AM, yet JULIE has managed to round
up all her co-workers: ALICE, HUTCH, CLARISSA, et al. They're groggy,
disheveled, un-made-up, unshaven. But they're there.

                           JULIE
            Six hours. That's when they pull the plug.
            That's how long we've got to wake him up.
                 (beat)

            Now these are Stu's old charts from five years
            ago, when he first came to the sleep lab...

She points to a series of EASELS where HUTCH and ALICE have been tacking
up EEG printouts, engram maps, etc.

                           JULIE
            ...they show incredibly intense nightmare
            activity. The chart below is his new chart...

The lower chart shows a JAGGED SPIKE virtually identical to the one on
the upper chart. JULIE pauses for effect - then pulls on the edge of the
lower chart, OPENING IT UP like a gatefold -

The onlookers GASP. Opened accordion-style, the lower chart shows the
SAME SPIKE recurring again and again, TEN TIMES OVER!

                           HUTCH
            Holy shit.

                           JULIE
            He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.
                 (beat)
            Anybody here know what Oneirix is?

                           CLARISSA
            Sure - it's an enzyme. The brain secretes it
            during violent dream activity...

                           HUTCH
            It's nightmare juice. Julie and I were on the
            team that learned to synthesize it. If those
            charts are right, Stu's swimming in the stuff.
                 (puzzled)
            Are you thinking we can decrease the levels?

                           JULIE
            No. I want to give him more. I want to give him
            a massive dose.

                           HUTCH
            That's not going to stop his nightmare -

                        JULIE
            I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I
            want to crank it up. I want to take it right off
            the charts. I want to scare him awake.

The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky. JULIE claps her hands:

                           JULIE
            All right! We have a plan. Let's move!

As the group swings into action, HUTCH pulls JULIE aside.

                           HUTCH
            You know, Julie, even if this works - which it
            probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't
            know what it'll do to his brain.

                           JULIE
            What'll it do if they pull the plug?

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LAND OF DEATH - NIGHT

A PANORAMIC VIEW of an impossibly grand, Gilded-Age TRAIN STATION. A
central turntable is the hub for dozens of TUNNELS, which converge like
the spokes of a wheel, disgorging long trains full of DEAD PASSENGERS
from all over the world.

Far above, in the dizzying reaches of the vaulted DOME that crowns the
station, REAPERS on FLYING BICYCLES spiral about like mosquitos,
bringing dead souls to their final reward.

This is Thanatopolis - land of Death - truly the end of the line.

A WET SQUEEGEE scrapes across the frame - wielded by a GRIM REAPER in a
jumpsuit bearing the logo of "LAND OF DEATH WINDOW WASHERS, INC." The
noise is irritating, so a REAPER on the inside snaps the venetian blinds
shut, cutting off our view.

CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we realize we've been seeing all this through the
wall-to-wall windows of...

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

It looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the Nautilus; the
decor is ornate, and the office equipment - vacuum tubes, pipe
intercoms, etc. - is on loan from the Jules Verne Museum of Defunct
Technology.

REAPERS are bustling about everywhere. One of them pushing a HAND TRUCK
laden with oversized crates bearing the label "DEAD SOULS."

                           REAPER
            Batch of souls - just back from Processing.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            Put them over there with the others.

He unloads the crates in a corner of the room, where SCORES of crated
souls are already piled up.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            Your Grimness? We have a new shipment -

                           DEATH (o.s.)
            Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'll get to it...

We can't see DEATH himself - just the back of a tall swivel chair. With
much creaking, it rotates around - bringing us face-to-face with...

CLOSEUP - DEATH

He's not at all what you'd expect. He's a chubby-cheeked, bespectacled
ACCOUNTANT TYPE...a harried bureaucrat, just trying to do his job.
There's something sweet, almost avuncular about him.

There's an open crate of DEAD SOULS on his desk. Dead souls take the
form of PERFORATED PAPER DOLLS...two-dimensional, underwear-clad,
usually wearing expressions of shock. DEATH pulls a sheet from the box,
detaches the dead soul, and outfits it with a cut-out TOGA.

Now he places it in a big diorama - with OODLES of toga-clad souls
staring up at a scale model of an active volcano. He throws a switch and
BEAMS as the volcano spits BLOBS OF KETCHUP into the air.

                           DEATH
            Last Days of Pompeii...now there was a Great
            Moment in Death.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            If I may point out...it is 12:05...

DEATH, grumbling, digs into the box and pulls out another soul. His eyes
light up. He clutches the sheet with trembling hands.

                           DEATH
            I can't believe - oh, man, I - SINATRA!! Do you
            know how long I've been waiting for this?

Sure enough, the doll on the sheet is Ol' Blue Eyes. DEATH digs in a
desk drawer and pulls out a SHOEBOX DIORAMA...DINO and SAMMY standing at
microphones, with a third, center mike conspicuously open.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            Make that 12:07, your bleakness...the dispatch
            team is waiting...

Grumpy, DEATH shoves FRANK, DEAN, and SAMMY back in the drawer.

                           DEATH
            Okay, okay, send 'em in. Jeez.


INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A FLUNKY opens the office door, and a long line of REAPERS glides in.
DEATH lugs an enormous musty leather-bound BOOK over to a long table. He
snaps his fingers and WHISTLES.

His pet HELLHOUND - a tiny plump weiner dog, with a HORNED DEATH'S HEAD
for a face, comes skittering across the office floor and jumps into his
lap. Meanwhile, the ASSISTANT turns on a chugging, card-shuffling UNIVAC
COMPUTER, which spits out a length of TICKERTAPE.

                           ASSISTANT
            Chakasandra Singh, New Delhi. Snakebite.

DEATH checks the name against the master list in his big ledger. He
pulls out a document and puts his STAMP on it - the DEATH WARRANT. This
he gives to the REAPER at the head of the line.

                           ASSISTANT
            Mulrooney, Lavinia P., Dearborn, Michigan. Head
            crushed in a pants press.

As the line moves along, we notice an odd-looking REAPER nearing the
desk. His gait is wobbly. His head bobs independently of the rest of his
body. There's a big, luminescent STAIN on the front of his shroud.

                           DEATH
            YOU!!!

EVERYONE FREEZES as DEATH points a bony finger DIRECTLY AT the wobbly
REAPER with the iridescent stain.

                           DEATH
            You're the customer, okay? You're about to die.
            It's a big occasion. A formal occasion. And as
            you shuffle off this mortal coil, the last thing
            your eyes behold is a Grim Reaper covered
            with...
                 (sputtering)
            What the hell is that??

TWO VOICES come out from under the shroud at once:

            STU                                 MONKEYBONE
   Cranberry Margarita.                Sex on the Beach.

Much COUGHING and THROAT-CLEARING from under the shroud. By now DEATH'S
LAPDOG is GROWLING at the STAINED REAPER, and DEATH can't hear what
anyone is saying. He shushes the dog.

                           DEATH
            ...What??

            STU                                 MONKEYBONE
   Salty Dog.                          Sufferin' Bastard.

The little hellhound YIPS VICIOUSLY. DEATH whacks him on the rump.

                           DEATH
            Well - whatever it is - you get that shroud to
            the dry cleaner ASAP! Now where were we?

                           ASSISTANT
            Clarke P. Devereaux, San Francisco.
            Complications resulting from coma...

                           DEATH
            Oh, wait. Says here he's supposed to recover.

A loud chorus of "A WWWWW's" from the disappointed REAPERS. DEATH stamps
the word "REPRIEVE" on Clarke's warrant.

His ASSISTANT crosses the room. In the far wall is a steel-reinforced
VAULT DOOR with a hydraulic wheel - the kind you see at banks. The
ASSISTANT dials in a combination, turns the wheel, laboriously pulls the
door open and STEPS INSIDE...

...returning, a moment later, with a priceless gold E-TICKET!!

The UPPER HALF of the STAINED REAPER begins to gyrate wildly.

CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER THE SHROUD

MONKEYBONE is doing an agitated TAP DANCE on his head. His TAIL whips
repeatedly across STU'S FACE.


INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - BACK TO SCENE

The REAPER in front of the boys stares at the E-ticket, crestfallen.

                           DEATH
            Take this to Dark Town. Sad to say, he's gonna
            live another forty years.
                 (a consoling pat on the shoulder)
            Sorry. Nobody said this job would be easy.

The ASSISTANT hands the REAPER a YELLOW MAILMAN'S POUCH containing the
E-ticket. But before he can depart, the STAINED REAPER - aka STU and
MONKEYBONE - jumps to the front of the line.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Say, Death, just out of curiosity, could we
            maybe swap jobs with that other guy? See, we've
            been meaning to drop in on Dark Town - I mean
            I've been meaning to...

DEATH is stunned by this unprecedented breach of protocol. The other
REAPERS in the line are ABUZZ.

                           DEATH
            ...I beg your pardon?

                           MONKEYBONE
            I got relatives there. I...EEP!!

CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER SHROUD

An ENRAGED STU is yanking on MONKEYBONE'S TAIL, signalling him to shut
up. MONKEYBONE, in pain, squeals repeatedly. Finally he reaches down and
PUNCHES STU IN THE NOSE.

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - BACK TO SCENE

The blow sends STU staggering. DEATH and the other REAPERS look on in
astonishment as the STAINED REAPER does a bizarre DANCE across the
floor, top half and bottom half moving independently. Miraculously, he
manages to right himself and regain his balance.

                           DEATH
            Now what were you saying?

                        STU/MONKEYBONE
                 (in unison)
            Nothing.

                           DEATH
            I'd like to have a word with you in private.

He stands and gestures toward a side room. The boys follow. The little
HELLHOUND scampers out from behind the desk...

...and GRABS THE HEM OF THEIR SHROUD in its teeth! The boys keep on
walking, but the shroud stays behind. Somehow they go three or four
steps before they realize they've been exposed.

DEATH jumps a foot in the air and SHRIEKS. PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS.

                           DEATH
            IMPOSTORS!! GET 'EM!!

The boys back toward the big WINDOW overlooking the trainyard. The
REAPERS close in on them, BRANDISHING THEIR SCYTHES.

                           DEATH
            HYPNOS! That little twerp! He's the one who put
            you up to this!

With a SCREECH, MONKEYBONE LEAPS into the air, BOUNDS OVER the heads and
shoulders of the advancing REAPERS, and SNATCHES the yellow E-ticket
pouch from the guy Death gave it to.

He bounds over a table and into STU's arms, with the precious pouch in
hand! DEATH lets out a great rattling BELLOW OF RAGE.

His features begin to JITTER VIOLENTLY. HIS HEAD EXPLODES!!!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Yowie.

Nothing to lose at this point. With a CRASH, the boys DIVE THROUGH THE
BIG WINDOW overlooking the trainyard!

The headless DEATH gropes around blindly, waving to his ASSISTANT.

                           DEATH
            Head. HEAD!!

The ASSISTANT opens a cabinet containing a half-dozen identical HEADS.
He pulls out a spare and screws it onto DEATH's neck.

EXT. TRAINYARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard. Behind them, REAPERS
are shepherding a line of newly arrived DEAD PEOPLE past a sign which
reads: "PROCESSING - THIS WAY."

By the time they can dust themselves off, an ALARM starts blaring.
REAPERS drop what they're doing, point at the boys. Panic time!

Nearby, a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN. Side-by-side they
race toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch,
YANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war.

STU's bigger. He pulls the pouch onto his shoulder, and MONKEYBONE with
it. They grab the bike, climb aboard, and pedal off -

- revealing the SIGN it was leaning against: "CYCLE REPAIR."

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE - THAT MOMENT

STU pedals onto the central turntable area. The BATWINGS on the rear of
the bike flap feebly, but the flying bike just won't fly.

MONKEYBONE looks over his shoulder. A small ARMY of REAPERS, anned with
scythes, is pouring into the trainyard behind them.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu...Stu...

                           STU
            IT'S NOT WORKING.

                           MONKEYBONE
            There's a thing here! There's a switch!

MONKEYBONE fiddles with the ignition switch. A BLACK CLOUD OF EXHAUST
belches violently from the rear of the bike, almost pitching them off
their seat. The batwings start to flap faster...

SPUT. BLAP. The engine BACKFIRES and DIES. STU fiddles with the switch,
but it's no go.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu...LOOK!

                           STU
            What?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Isn't that Lulu?

LULU is still sitting in her little car at the edge of the tracks, eyes
crossed, mouth agape. MONKEYBONE waves brightly. Then a mob of REAPERS
appears on either side of LULU's car, swarming out onto the tracks! STU
starts pedaling for his life.

He makes for the TRAIN TUNNELS in the far wall of the station.
ILLUMINATED SIGNS over the tunnels read: Calcutta...Hong Kong...Waco, TX
...and directly ahead...

Dark Town!! By now they're well out onto the turnaround. STU pedals
frantically, BOUNCING over tracks and ties. MONKEYBONE bites his
fingernails down to the quick as he watches the column of REAPERS
pursuing them onto the tracks.

INT. OFFICE - ON DEATH

watching through a crooked spyglass as the boys pedal down the tracks.

                           DEATH
            Now we've got 'em.

Petting his hellhound, he reaches for a WALL SWITCH.

EXT. TRAINYARD - HIGH ANGLE

The boys are almost at the Dark Town tunnel. The REAPERS, on foot, will
never be able to catch them. But as they pick up speed for the stretch
run, the GROUND begins to move beneath them!

DEATH has activated the TRAIN TURNAROUND - the rotating platform at the
end of the line which allows an engine to reverse direction. Before they
know it, they're doing a full 180!

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE

The boys continue to bounce down the tracks - but the tunnel entrances
seem to be SPINNING before their eyes. Before they know it, they're
pedaling directly TOWARD the mob of ANGRY REAPERS!!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Weren't we just here?

STU jerks the handlebars HARD RIGHT and JUMPS THE TRACK he's on. He
WINCES IN PAIN as the bike BOUNCES over a series of rails...

                           MONKEYBONE
            What'd I tell you? You go to the Land of Death,
            wear a jockstrap!

EXT. TRAINYARD - HIGH ANGLE

The REAPERS are SPREADING OUT around the turntable - encircling it! STU
rides around the periphery of the great turning platter, but there's no
getting off. They're completely surrounded!

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE

MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear. But STU is rattling the
ignition switch, making ONE LAST EFFORT to get the bike aloft...

THE ENGINE CATCHES. Trailing black fumes, the BICYCLE RISES! The REAPERS
converge in its path, and RAISE THEIR SCYTHES...

But the bike JUST MANAGES TO CLEAR the tangle of scythes - leaving the
REAPERS slicing at empty air!

INT. OFFICE - ON DEATH

Through the big window, he sees the boys leveling off, flying toward the
DARK TOWN TUNNEL. They're moments away from a clean escape.

INT. STU'S ROOM - NIGHT

STU's readout monitors are registering frantic nightmare activity when
JULIE and ALICE enter. JULIE sets her purse on STU's bedside table -
removes a SYRINGE and a test tube filled with PURPLISH FLUID.

                           JULIE
            What's the maximum safe dose?

                           ALICE
            Most we've ever used is half a CC.

                           JULIE
            Five CC's.

CLOSEUP - DEATH

He unlocks a RED SECURITY BOX on his wall. Inside is a TOGGLE SWITCH
labelled "FATE WORSE THAN DEATH." He flips it...

CLOSEUP - THE SYRINGE

The plunger goes down, injecting fluid into STU...

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON FLYING BIKE

MONKEYBONE is sitting on STU's shoulder, facing backward, thumbing his
nose at the REAPERS. STU glances back as well, laughing, unable to
believe his own good luck.

Since they're both looking the wrong way, neither of them sees the
sheer, monolithic WALL rising up DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH.

It's no ordinary wall. It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the
closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period -

- and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING
STU against the ground underneath!

STU'S DREAMSCAPE

No bike. No monkey. Just STU - who finds himself on an operating table,
with the world of the painting coming to 3-D life around him. The WOLF-
FACED SURGEONS are closing in on him, baring their fangs, brandishing
their scalpels and their metallic REPLACEMENT PARTS...

Suddenly the fabric of this weird reality TEARS - just like a rip in a
canvas. A FURRY PAW reaches through - GRABS STU by the hand...

                           MONKEYBONE
            This ain't my nightmare!

EXT. TRAINYARD - JUST OUTSIDE TUNNEL

MONKEYBONE PULLS STU through the rip in the back of the giant toppled
canvas. The bike's there waiting. They hop aboard and pedal off INTO THE
DARK TOWN TUNNEL a split-second before the REAPERS arrive to slice them
to ribbons.

INT. DARK TOWN TUNNEL - ON BICYCLE

STU pedals so hard his heart is about to burst. He feels down at his
side - the yellow pouch containing the E-ticket is still there. The
REAPERS are clustered at the mouth of the tunnel, but they aren't
following.

The boys WEEP WITH GLEE. It's a miracle - they've cheated Death!

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

An exhausted STU huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last
stretch of track to the platform outside the gates. He climbs off the
bike and stares back - it looks like the last thousand miles or so have
all been uphill. He slings the YELLOW POUCH over his shoulder...

                           STU
            You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've
            made it without you.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.

                           STU
            It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like
            there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's
            gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay
            when I'm gone?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.

                           STU
            You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure
            wish I could take you home with me.

The gates slide open. STU passes through. But MONKEYBONE lingers behind
a moment - just long enough for one of the SINGING SPHINXES to slip him
a big, nasty BASEBALL BAT.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well,
            there's a new twist.

                           STU
            Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I
            really do love y--

He turns - and MONKEYBONE MARK McGWIRES HIM upside the head! STU
crumples in a heap...

                           MONKEYBONE
            Love you too. Boss.

Laughing maniacally, MONKEYBONE STEALS the E-TICKET and goes RACING OFF
DOWN THE MIDWAY!!

STU'S HEAD is swimming. It takes him a few seconds, but he gets to his
feet. By now, MONKEYBONE is halfway to the E-ticket ride. Worse yet,
STU'S WATCH reads 8:59 AM!!!

                           STU
            Stop! Monkeybone! Please!!

EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - NIGHT

The STREETS ARE LINED with Darktowners ROOTING MONKEYBONE ON as if he's
the hometown favorite in a big footrace. Which he is.

MONKEYBONE reaches the E-TICKET RIDE - drops his E-TICKET into the
receptacle at the gate. The drawbridge lowers...

As STU sprints down the street, the SNAIL MAN oozes into his path - and
TRIPS HIM! Before he can get up, cackling DARKTOWNERS converge on him -
forcing him back to the ground and HOLDING HIM THERE.

                           STU
            NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET!
            HE'S GOT MY -

                           HYPNOS
            Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got
            big plans for that body of yours!

EXT. E-TICKET RIDE - ON MONKEYBONE

The familiar miasma of COLORS is beginning to swirl in the night sky
overhead. MONKEYBONE straps on a NEEDLE-TIPPED HELMET which makes him
look like a simian DART. Then he climbs into the seat of the TEST-YOUR-
STRENGTH machine and braces himself for the big ride!

EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - THAT MOMENT - RIGHT

ONLOOKERS APPLAUD as the robot lifts its mallet and LETS FLY. DING!! The
tiny figure of MONKEYBONE soars toward the swirling colors. His DART-
HELMET strikes the black hole dead center.

STU WATCHES HELPLESSLY as MONKEYBONE penetrates the veil of the sky and
VANISHES. He's still SCREAMING when the cackling DARKTOWNERS drag him
out of the plaza by the heels...

                           STU
            NO! JULIE! NO-O-O-O!

AERIAL SHOT - ON MONKEYBONE

ROCKETING UPWARD through the clouds in his dart-helmet, a look of SHEER
EXHILARATION on his simian face. Somewhere a CLOCK begins to chime the
hour...


INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - 8:59 AM - DAY

MOST OF OUR CAST is either in STU's room or in the hallway outside.

PLUS we've got a man of the cloth; two LEGAL TYPES, with briefcases; and
several of the NURSES from the facility.

ALICE squeezes JULIE's hand, and JULIE squeezes STU's. The minute hand
on the clock hits twelve. KIMMY, sobbing into a handkerchief, gives DR.
EDELSTEIN the nod. As he reaches for the power switch...

                           STU
            EEEEEEPP!!

JULIE DROPS the hand with a gasp. The DOCTOR jumps half a foot.

All at once STU is sitting BOLT UPRIGHT IN BED...shaking his head and
feeling around gingerly under the bedclothes, as if something VERY SHARP
has just poked him in the ass.

                           STU
            Oooie! That smarts!!!

KIMMY sighs and FAINTS DEAD AWAY.

STU blinks and looks about the room, disoriented. It could be because
he's just come out of a coma after seven months. Or it could be because
he's a MONKEY unaccustomed to hanging out in a human body.

                           JULIE
            Stu?

                           STU
            Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.

A BURST OF LAUGHTER from the others in the room. Weeping TEARS OF JOY,
JULIE flings herself across the bed and hugs him tight.

While JULIE is hugging him, STU is checking out his new fingers and
toes, RUBBING his sparse patch of CHEST FUR. DOCTORS and NURSES look on
in amazement from the doorway.

                           NURSE
            It's a miracle. It's a miracle.

                           DOCTOR
            Two more ticks of the clock...

STU is almost oblivious to JULIE. He lifts up the sheet, sneaks a quick
peek at his CROTCH, and grins delightedly.

JULIE gives him another kiss, WHISPERS in his ear:

                           JULIE
            Thank you. Thank you for coming back to me.

What she doesn't know is that, although he still looks like STU, his
body is now occupied by MONKEYBONE. Since he's now a hybrid character,
man on the outside and monkey within, let's call him...

                           STU-BONE
            Boy, I don't know about you guys, but I'm
            starving.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

A damp, stonewalled VAULT with a barred door. STU is sprawled on the
floor, OUT COLD, when a VOICE awakes him...

                           RAT GUARD (o.s.)
            Heads up! Feeding time!

STU comes around just in time to see a PANEL sliding open in the ceiling
far overhead. A torrent of JUNK - stale popcorn, half-eaten candy bars,
molten ice cream pops, and sticky soda - rains down ON HIS FACE.

A horde of DARK FIGURES emerge from the shadowy catacombs around him.
All at once, HANDS are grabbing at him from all directions. STU lets out
a SCREAM - backs up against a wall -

                           STU
            Who are y-- WHAT DO YOU WANT??

A MONGOL WARRIOR with a droopy mustache looks up at him.

                           GENGHIS KHAN
            Dinner.

After a moment STU realizes that the DARK FIGURES have almost no
interest in him - instead, they've been grabbing at the half-eaten
SNACKS that cascaded down onto his head. A long-haired SLAV - RASPUTIN -
dives on a Hershey bar with only one bite out of it, but an oddly
familiar FAT MAN gets there first. STU gapes at him...

                           STU
            Alfred Hitchcock??

                           EDGAR ALLAN POE
            A fat bastard, but damn quick on his feet.

                           TYPHOID MARY
            That's how he keeps his girlish figure.

                           STEPHEN KING
            Gotta move fast in this crowd, or you'll starve.
            Here you go, pal. Have some popcorn.

He offers STU a box of popcorn soaked in Dr. Pepper.

                           STU
            What is this stuff?

                           STEPHEN KING
            They feed us the slops from the Morpheum
            Theatre. You hope for Jujubes, settle for
            goobers. - I'm Steve. Steve King.

                           STU
            Stephen King? What are you doing in here?

Various OTHERS emerge from the shadows to shake STU's hand.

                           JACK THE RIPPER
            I'm Jack the Ripper.

                           TYPHOID MARY
            Typhoid Mary.

                           ATILLA THE HUN
            Atilla the Hun. Trade you a Twizzler for a box
            of Raisinets!

                           STU
            Atilla the - ! What in hell is this place?

As if in reply, a FANFARE sounds in the distance...


INT. DUNGEON - ENTRANCE

A RAT GUARD stands at attention by the door, TOOTING HIS KAZOO to
announce the arrival of an honored guest.

                           RAT GUARD
            All hail the most glorious! Most eminent! Most
            esteemed all-powerful God of Sleep...his Royal
            Lassitude -

                           HYPNOS
            Enough, enough, I'm hung over.

As HYPNOS passes, the DUNGEON DWELLERS race up to the WALL OF BARS that
separates the entry area from the dungeon proper.

                           TYPHOID MARY
            Hyp! Did you bring me the cough medicine?

                           STEPHEN KING
            Did you remember the night light I asked for?

                           EDGAR ALLAN POE
            King, you pussy.

                           STEPHEN KING
            Bite me, Poe! I hate waking up in the dark.

                           HYPNOS
            Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new
            guest settling in - ?

                           STU
            YOU SET ME UP!!

STU LUNGES at HYPNOS - who backs up just out of reach.

                           HYPNOS
            Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It
            ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets.
            Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and
            that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?

                           STU
            Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?

                           HYPNOS
            It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of
            'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy
            up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker!
            Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been
            doing this all the way back to Atilla and
            Genghis Khan!

                           STU
            But why me? Why'd you pick on me??

                           HYPNOS
            The monkey, of course. It was his idea.

                           STU
            Monkeybone...!?

                           HYPNOS
            Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day
            he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help
            him get your body...in return he gives us all
            the nightmares we want.

                           STU
            You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he
            gonna do - draw really scary cartoons??

                           HYPNOS
            Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that
            girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical
            basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a
            big old batch of nightmare juice!

STU's face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan.

                           HYPNOS
            Oh, we're predicting a record box-office. It's
            like I always say...nightmares are your best
            entertainment!

HYPNOS marches off, chuckling. STU's head sinks into his hands.


EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

STU's back from the hospital. JULIE is removing his bags from the trunk
of KIMMY's car while STU and KIMMY chat in the front seat.

                           KIMMY
            I just couldn't stand the thought of you
            suffering. I love you so, I would never have...
            forgive me, Stu. Please forgive me.

                           STU-BONE
            Kimmy. Chill. We've still got a pact. If
            anything ever happens to you, I'll be right
            there to return the favor.
                 (baring his teeth)
            So drive carefully! From now on.

He climbs out. KIMMY is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the car
parked in front of her. She PEELS OUT with the hand brake still on.

INT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

STU-BONE and JULIE enter with luggage. He stands there for a moment
scoping out the unfamiliar surroundings. She sets the bags down, taps
him on the shoulder.

                           JULIE
            Welcome home.

STU-BONE grins insipidly. She kisses him, pulls him into a tight embrace
- and then, overwhelmed by emotion, begins to SOB.

                           JULIE
            Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.

                           STU-BONE
            Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting
            something a little swankier. How much loot does
            old Stu rake in, anyway?

She gives him an extremely puzzled look.

                           STU-BONE
            Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself.
            You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty
            lucrative franchise...

                           JULIE
            Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for
            a minute. I'll be right back.

She goes into the kitchen as STU-BONE plops onto the sofa. He spies a
bowl of FRESH FRUIT on the coffee table and immediately tries to pick up
a banana with his FOOT.

But he can't. He's got shoes on. Frowning, he unties his shoe, peels off
his sock. His bare foot is in the fruit bowl when JULIE returns from the
kitchen with a TRAY holding a chocolate cake and the bottle of CHAMPAGNE
Stu bought three months ago. The cake bears the message "WELCOME HOME -
I LOVE YOU" in pink icing.

She sits beside him with the goodies. He removes his foot from the bowl,
crosses his legs, WIGGLES HIS TOES at her. She smiles uncertainly. Then
she opens the bottle of champagne and pours two flutes full.

                           JULIE
            Here's to a bottle...we should have opened...
            three months ago.

She finishes pouring, hands a flute to STU-BONE. His face is smeared
with CAKE and ICING. He's scooped out a big fistful and crammed it right
into his pie hole. He GRINS at her.

                           STU-BONE
            Bitchin' good cake.

                           JULIE
            Stu, are you...feeling okay?

                           STU-BONE
            Sure. Why?

                           JULIE
            You're acting kind of...odd.

                           STU-BONE
                 (grabbing another fistful)

            In what way?

Then: we hear TINY NAILS skittering across the hardwood floors at high
speed. And BUSTER THE DOG races into the living room!

                           JULIE
            Buster! Look who's here!

STU-BONE tenses instinctively. The dog is yipping, wagging his tail
insanely at the sight of his long-lost master - until he gets just a
little bit closer, and senses that something is very, very wrong.

BUSTER sizes STU-BONE up and GROWLS. STU-BONE bares his teeth and
HISSES. The dog LUNGES - and STU-BONE jumps up on the sofa!

                           STU-BONE
            Oh shit, the cake!

He bends down, snatches up the cake, and CRADLES IT under one arm as he
KICKS AT BUSTER from the sofa.

                           STU-BONE
            Mine. Get back! MINE!!

The frazzled JULIE pours herself another jolt of champagne - a stiff
one.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

SOUNDS of JULIE taking a shower in the adjacent bathroom o.s.

STU-BONE is sprawled in bed, pillows propped up behind him, flipping
channels on the bedroom TV with his trusty remote. The Discovery Channel
happens to be showing a Jane Goodall special...

                           NARRATOR (on TV)
            The mating rituals of the African silverback are
            as rigidly formalized as those of any animal we
            know - with the possible exception of man.

Onscreen a FEMALE GORILLA is presenting her furry haunches to an ALPHA
MALE.

STU-BONE watches this erotic spectacle with a connoisseur's eye. He
glances over at the open bathroom door and catches a teasing glimpse of
JULIE'S SHADOW as she steps out of the shower and pulls on a robe. He
SCRATCHES and SNIFFS, just to put himself in the mood.

On TV: MONKEY FOREPLAY, which consists of a pounce from behind.

                           NARRATOR (on TV)
            In the wild, a dominant chimpanzee male is
            likely to engage in sex numerous times
            throughout the day, with a shockingly wide
            variety of -

STU-BONE mutes the nature special and sneaks up behind JULIE just as she
emerges from the bathroom in her robe and towel-turban.

                           JULIE
            What are you watching?

                           STU-BONE
            Ohhh, nothing.

She tries to pass, but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her
around. He delicately unwraps the turban, then opens her robe and pulls
it closed around the two of them. They kiss...

                           JULIE
            You sure this is...medically advisable?

                           STU-BONE
            Got a doctor on duty.

                           JULIE
            Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -

STU-BONE almost lets out a gasp of shock. What does she mean???

                           JULIE
                 (glancing downward)

            - which it seems to be.

STU-BONE does a take. The good news is, she doesn't suspect. The bad
news is, he's apparently named after his creator's penis.

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

All at once the air is full of Barry White's lush baritone on the
bedroom CD player. Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and JULIE
waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single
robe.

The only jarring note is BUSTER'S FRANTIC BARKING. The poor dog is stuck
behind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his
mistress about the imposter in STU's body. The dog is almost drowning
out Barry White -

- so STU-BONE stops kissing JULIE long enough to reach over with one
foot and KICK THE DOOR SHUT.

INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

JULIE watches from the bed as STU-BONE begins peeling off his PJ's,
going into a bizarrely formalized MONKEY MATING DANCE. He circles back
and forth from one side of the bed to the other, making faces, grunting,
FEINTING at her occasionally.

JULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic, but
in fact, it's making her damned nervous. She finds herself scrunching up
on the bed, trying to keep out of STU-BONE's way.

Now he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed. REARS BACK. And with an animal
howl of triumph, POUNCES AT JULIE!

Terrified, she rolls out of the way. STU-BONE'S SKULL slams into the
headboard.

                           JULIE
            Oh, God!! Baby! Are you -

Dazed, he sits up. He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and
he pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand.

EXT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

JULIE helps a punchdrunk, staggering STU to the stairway.

                           STU
            How was it? I don't recall.

                           JULIE
            It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.

As they pass, BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind
his gate. HOLD ON THE DOG's satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his
balance and topples down the stairs O.S.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

RASPUTIN, ATILLA, JACK THE RIPPER and STEPHEN KING are engrossed in
their weekly Parcheesi game. STU is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his
fate.

                           STU
            I'm not like the rest of you. I'm just a regular
            guy! I'm not a "nightmare maker."

                           RASPUTIN
            Neither are we. We got our bodies hijacked just
            like you. The guys who replaced us are the
            nightmare makers!

                           ATTILA
            Like me. I was a mess sergeant in the Mongol
            Horde. I never wanted to be the Scourge of Asia.
            I just wanted a new recipe for yak!

                           JACK THE RIPPER
            I was Jack the Haberdasher.

                           STU
            But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments?
            ...Monkeys??

                           STEPHEN KING
            Hey, I got screwed over by my own dog. Go
            through hell to get that E-ticket, and who winds
            up in my body? That darn Cujo.

TYPHOID MARY runs past, GIGGLING, pursued by a huffing HITCHCOCK.

                           RASPUTIN
            He's sure got a thing for those icy blondes.

KAZOOS SOUND. The RAT GUARD appears to announce:

                           RAT GUARD
            Miley. You got a visitor.

                           STU
            ...Kitty?!?

At the sight of STU behind bars, she breaks down CRYING.

                           KITTY
            I'm so sorry, Stu. I wanted to tell you what was
            going on. I really, really liked you.

                           STU
            Kitty...my situation is really not important.
            The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with,
            and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.

                           KITTY
            You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck
            in this place, and only thinking of her.

                           STU
            Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her
            what Monkeybone is up to??

                           RAT GUARD
            Time's up! Break it up, you two.

The RAT GUARD pushes STU back with a prod. KITTY reaches out...

                           KITTY
            No! Give me a moment. Just to look at him. Oh,
            Stu. Oh, my sweet, sweet Stu.

As she gazes at him, love struck, the overhead PANEL opens and a deluge
of CRUD from the Morpheum lands directly on STU.

                           RAT GUARD
            Feeding time!

KITTY BAWLS inconsolably as the RAT GUARD leads her away.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

STU-BONE in pajamas and a head bandage, reading the morning funnies. He
pounds the table, practically WEEPING with hilarity at the MONKEYBONE
COMIC STRIP.

                           STU-BONE
            Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just kills me!

                           JULIE
            I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure
            you'll be okay?

                           STU-BONE
            Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get.
            "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a
            big story! That's front page news! But I can't
            find a word of coverage in this stinkin' rag!
                 (shuffling through the paper)
            Hey. Don't I have a TV show?

                           JULIE
            They only made the one episode. They've shown it
            about nineteen times.

                           STU-BONE
            I need a new PR guy.

JULIE grins, plants a goodbye smooch on his forehead, and exits. He
waits a minute, then reaches for the PHONE.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

The house is crawling with PRESS. There must be three dozen REPORTERS
and PHOTOGRAPHERS and TV CREWS hanging on STU­BONE's every pronouncement.

                           STU-BONE
            Yes, being in a coma taught Stu Miley a thing or
            two about life. Buckle your seat belts, for one.
            But seriously, Stu Miley is a different man
            today. I'm much homier.

The front door opens. A stunned JULIE pushes her way inside...

                           STU-BONE
            And speaking of which, here's the light of my
            life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.

                           JULIE
            I had to park two blocks away. Is something -

He pulls her to his side for a photo op. FLASHBULBS go off.

                           STU
            I took the liberty of calling a little press
            conference. We're on TV, so don't say "shit."
                 ­(covering his mouth)
            Shit! I said it. Shit! I said it again!

                           REPORTER
            Stu, what is it about Monkeybone that makes him
            so popular?

                           STU-BONE
            Well, it's partly that he punctures all the
            phony pretensions of our modern society...and
            it's partly that he's a breathtakin',
            heartbreakin', rump-shakin' sex machine!
                 (beat)
            Ask these gentlemen here. They're an important
            cog in my media machine. They'll be doing six
            new episodes of the Monkeybone show under my
            personal supervision.

He pauses for a photo op with MIKE CACHUELA and MIKE MITCHELL.

                           STU-BONE
            It's all synergy. The show synergizes the strip,
            which synergizes the merchandising, which
            synergizes the religion, which synergizes the
            Barbara Walters special; and then, baby, we are
            all in the United Empire of Monkeybonia.


INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

JULIE squeezes through the crowd, finds HERB working the phone.

                           HERB
            I tell you, he's ready to merchandise. We've
            gotta move quickly. Get the toy guys, the burger
            guys, the lunchbox guys -

                           JULIE
            Herb...what in God's name -

HERB holds up a finger. He's too busy talking. STU-BONE enters with the
video crew in tow. JULIE somehow manages to sideline him.

                           JULIE
            What's this about merchandising? You always
            hated merchandising!

                           STU-BONE
            Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another
            angle...there's a potload of money here.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

SUPERCHARGED POP MUSIC underneath as STU-BONE comes running around a
corner - followed, a moment later, by a SCREAMING HORDE of BEAUTIFUL
GROUPIES in black miniskirts and high heels. It's like something out of

A Hard Day's Night, only more so.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT on STU-BONE, head still bandaged, eyes closed, SNORING slightly.
He wears a big monkey grin as he DREAMS the above.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A CARLOAD OF SUPERMODELS. They kill their engine in the middle of a busy
intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing STU-BONE.

He cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and FLATTENS HIMSELF
behind a dumpster. As the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief
and MOPS SWEAT from his brow.

Then, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and FLINGS HIS SWEATY
HANKIE into the midst of the GROUPIES. A CATFIGHT ensues as they
scramble after this precious memento. The chase resumes.

Suddenly he realizes he's SLOWING DOWN...running in SLO-MO. Same deal
with the girls on his trail. After a moment, he FREEZES. He can't move
anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...

...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of
him! HYPNOS is perfectly capable of moving. He strolls right up to the
frozen STU-BONE and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY, Moe Howard-style.

                           HYPNOS
            You two-bit simian stooge. WHAT THE HELL IS
            THIS? We didn't send you up here to shake your
            booty and chase broads. We sent you up to make
            nightmares!!

STU-BONE tries to speak. All that comes out is a slo-mo DRAWL.

                           HYPNOS
            Now find that nightmare juice and get to work.
            'Cause you may be a free man during the day...
            but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine!

He winds up - throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH at STU-BONE'S FACE.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed. For a moment he's relieved - it was
all a dream. Then he realizes his FACE is swelling like a
prizefighter's. His front tooth is loose. BLOOD is streaming from his
nose!

                           STU-BONE
            Eep!

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

He's awake, fully dressed, and fishing around in the pocket of JULIE's
topcoat. He finds her KEY RING and tiptoes furtively to the front door.

                           STU-BONE
            Friggin' Hypnos. I'll show him...

INT. SLEEP LAB - NIGHT

He unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab. Finds the dispensary
area and kneels beside a LOCKED REFRIGERATOR. Then he shuffles through
the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled "FRIDGE."

On the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label
"ONEIRIX" with red DANGER stickers all over it. STU-BONE takes it out,
flashes a sinister grin, and EMPTIES ITS CONTENTS into a similar beaker.
Then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it.

He's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of SIMIAN GRUNTS
and SQUEAKS - which are TRANSLATED in SUBTITLE:

                           FEMALE BABOON
            Hey, handsome.

He turns and spots a SEDUCTIVE FEMALE BABOON who's confmed to a CAGE in
the corner. The conversation continues in MONKEY TALK.

                           FEMALE BABOON
            Yeah, you. Come here, good-looking.
                 (beat)
            Why don't you let me out of this cage?

                           STU-BONE
            Hey, I'd love to, baby, but...it'd put me in hot
            water.

                           FEMALE BABOON
                 (caressing his chin)
            I know how to be very, very grateful.

He pulls out a MATCHBOOK and scribbles a number on it.

                           STU-BONE
            Tell you what, angel. When you get out, give me
            a call...

A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway! STU-BONE tries to dive
for cover, but the FEMALE BABOON grabs him by the belt and pulls him
against the cage.

Startled, he drops the ONEIRIX BEAKER - which rolls out into the hall!

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The beaker CLATTERS LOUDLY as it rolls through the lab door. STU-BONE'S
HANDS grope through the doorway - but the FEMALE BABOON has got him by
the pants leg and won't let go, no matter how much he rattles the cage.
He can't quite pull himself through the door...

He unbuckles the belt. UNZIPS HIS PANTS. Keeps clawing toward the
beaker. But he still can't quite make it, and the BABOON won't let go.

Now his pants are down around his knees. He keeps wriggling until his
pants legs are entirely INSIDE OUT - and still he can't quite reach the
beaker! His shoes are caught in his pants cuffs! RRRRRIPPPPP...

Freedom! Minus his pants, he GRABS THE BEAKER.

In FG through all this is a dim teenage JANITOR pushing his electric
floor polisher. He has his Walkman on and he can't hear any of the
mayhem behind him. He sings along atonally with the music:

                           JANITOR
            Gettin' jiggy wit' it - gettin' jiggy wit' it...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

A disheveled STU-BONE, back from his secret mission, is trying to take
his clothes off so he won't wake JULIE. But she starts to rouse, so he
jumps into bed fully dressed and pulls up the covers.

                           JULIE
            Stu? Is that you? Where did you go?

                           STU-BONE
            Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.

                           JULIE
            Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.

                           STU-BONE
            Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.

She pulls the covers back. He's still wearing his topcoat, shoes, socks,
and shorts...but NO PANTS.

                           JULIE
            You're wearing a topcoat, Stu. - Where are your
            pants?

                           STU-BONE
            Well, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I
            wouldn't need any pants. Now would I?

He pulls the covers up to his chin. The two of them lie there in the
dark staring up at the ceiling.


INT. STU'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The entire Monkeybone brain trust has come to visit: HERB, syndicate
head MR. BOWERS, and several CORPORATE REPS hoping to arrange tie-in
deals. Host STU-BONE has started to take on a simian look: more
prominent ears, flared nostrils, heavy beard stubble, etc.

The BURGER GOD REP sets a tray of FAST FOOD in front of STU-BONE - the
packaging all covered with angelic haloed Monkeybones.

                           BURGER GOD REP
            As you know, Burger God has 1700 outlets
            nationwide...we're prepared to back a major TV
            buy to launch our Mega Monkey Meal.
                 (beat)
            Go ahead. Try a bite.

STU-BONE takes a bite out of his Monkeyburger - looks pleased at first -
then begins PICKING something out of his teeth.

                           HERB
            What's the matter?

                           STU-BONE
            I think it's a pig hair.
                 (examining a contract)
            How much is McDonald's offering?

                           HERB
            Less.

STU-BONE immediately signs the contract and shakes hands with the BURGER
GOD REP. HERB consults his agenda.

                           HERB
            Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking
            off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if
            you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.

                           STU-BONE
            How much?

                           HERB
            Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could
            probably get People and Entertainment Tonight to
            cover it.

                           STU-BONE
            I get it. We could give the public the
            impression that we were doing something...
            charitable. Brilliant!!

                           HERB
            And last...you remember Bill here, from the
            Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something
            I think you'll like.

The TOY REP sets a LOCKBOX on the table. A stencil on the box reads "TOP
SECRET." He pulls out a key and opens it to reveal...

...a tuxedoed, collector's-edition MONKEYBONE DOLL lying on a bed of
CRUSHED PURPLE VELVET. He carefully removes the treasure from its chest.
Its right hand is hinged. The doll's thumb is UP ITS REAR.

                           BAZOOM TOY REP
            It's a prototype. Code name "Little Jack
            Horner." Go on - pull out his thumb.

STU-BONE stares at the doll - cautiously yanks its thumb out. We go to
SLO-MO as the rising arm causes a NOXIOUS AEROSOL SPRAY to shoot out of
Monkeybone's ass!

And we STAY in slo-mo as STU-BONE stares at the doll in wonderment and
awe...a man in looooove.

Still in slo-mo, the EXECS crack up, gag, hold their noses at the awful
stank of it. STU-BONE is the only one not laughing. He reaches out to
touch the doll - to fondle it adoringly -

- and suddenly we're back to REAL-TIME.

                           BAZOOM TOY REP
            You know kids - they love anything gross...

                           STU-BONE
            Kids? Kids?! This is a work of genius. This is
            art. This is the answer to all my prayers!
                 (beat)

            Say - just a technical question - could you fill
            these babies up with a particulate solution of
            one part chemical enzyme to ten parts water?

                           BAZOOM EXEC
            Well - I guess...

                           STU-BONE
            Aww righhhhht!

He breaks into RIOTOUS LAUGHTER and begins blasting monkeyfarts at HERB
and the EXECS, who dive for cover under the conference table.

EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Laughter and back-slapping as STU-BONE walks his guests to their cars.

                           STU
            So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo
            benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with
            Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em.

                           HERB
            A piñata. That's a great idea!

                           STU-BONE
            You guys don't know it, but you just saved my
            ass!

With a big grin, he pantomimes sticking a thumb up his ass, in obvious
imitation of the doll, and then gives the thumbs-up sign. The unnerved
EXECS gape at him as he goes back inside - he's developed an odd, loping
gait, and his arms swing outward in wide arcs as he walks.

                           BURGER GOD EXEC
            Interesting fellow.

                           HERB
            Head trauma.

INT. STU'S KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

He digs around under the sink, finds the purple beaker of ONEIRIX. Looks
at the FARTING DOLL...and GRINS.

                           STU-BONE
            This'll get him off my back!

INSERT - TV SCREEN

A PROMO for the MONKEYBONE cartoon show. MONKEYBONE swings across the
screen on a vine, followed by a string of grinning, live-action FANS
doing a scratch 'n' sniff, pull-out-a-plum LINE DANCE.

                           ANNOUNCER
            It's his world - we just live in it. Monkeybone!
            Back with six all-new episodes, starting -

INT. LIVING ROOM - REVERSE ANGLE - NIGHT

A distraught JULIE mutes the TV. Her friend ALICE is on the sofa beside
her, having coffee and dessert.

                           JULIE
            The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's
            acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to
            be.

                           ALICE
            Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.

                           JULIE
            I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure
            it did. It's as if...he's not Stu any more. The
            Stu I love is gone!
                 (beat)

            He spends all his time in the garage. He says
            he's...autographing.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON the flask of ONEIRIX as STU-BONE picks it up.

He's wearing a GAS MASK. He's rigged a CLOTHESLINE in the garage.
MONKEYBONE DOLLS are clipped to it, ass-end up - forming a makeshift
ASSEMBLY LINE. He dips a TURKEY BASTER into the flask...withdraws a
quantity of purple fluid...plucks the FINGER out of the first doll's
behind...

- and plunges the TURKEY BASTER into the doll's hindquarters, filling it
with ONEIRIX!! The doll's buttocks take on the purple hue characteristic
of Orangutans in heat. STU-BONE holds the doll at arm's length and pulls
its finger - launching a purple puff of SPIKED NIGHTMARE GAS.

                           STU-BONE
            Yeah, baby! Nightmare-in-a-butt!
                 (looking around)
            Okay...guinea pig, guinea pig...

EXT. GARAGE/BACK YARD - NIGHT

STU-BONE steps out into the driveway and hears a low growl - BUSTER is
giving him the stinkeye from behind the picket fence. STU-BONE's eyes
light up with inspiration.

                           STU-BONE
            C'mere, boy...c'mere, ole buddy...

INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

LOUD BARKING outside. JULIE wanders over toward the window.

                           ALICE
            Listen. Let's bring him in for some tests. I
            guarantee you're overreacting.

JULIE lifts the curtain - and sees STU-BONE in his gas mask, bent over
in a weird crab like stance, chasing BUSTER around the yard with the
Monkeybone doll.

JULIE doesn't seem especially surprised - but ALICE's mouth falls open.

                           JULIE
            Actually, no, I don't think I'm overreacting.

EXT. BACK YARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

BUSTER is apparently ALONE now - he's pacing in circles under a HIGH
TREE BRANCH, staring up and GROWLING. Someone throws a PINE CONE at the
picket fence. BUSTER'S HEAD TURNS, just for an instant -

                           STU-BONE
            KREEEGAHHHH!!!

- and STU-BONE plunges out of the tree, DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE DOG! The
two of them GRAPPLE, rolling around on the grass.

For a moment it looks like this battle royale could go either way. Then
STU-BONE gets on top of BUSTER, STRADDLES HIM, shoves the ASS of the
Monkeybone doll up against his muzzle...

FOONT! A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face. The dog
goes limp. His eyes roll back in his head. He starts to TWITCH.

                           STU-BONE
            Sweet dreams, you little bastard!

Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with
both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR. Lights go on all over the
neighborhood. ANGRY NEIGHBORS poke their heads out the windows.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

STU-BONE skulks back into the garage. He throws back a tarp, revealing
HUNDREDS of boxed Monkeybone dolls, stacked so high they fill an entire
wall of the garage. He pulls out his turkey baster, cranks up the
clothesline, and goes to work.

EXT. BACK YARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS IN on the twitching face of BUSTER, and we see

BUSTER'S DREAM (BLACK & WHITE)

A German-expressionist nightmare, all low angles and heavy shadows.
We're in some kind of OPERATING ROOM, where a struggling PATIENT is
being wheeled in on a tall, creaking GURNEY. Four ORDERLIES in surgical
masks are holding him down.

The PATIENT is BUSTER. And the ORDERLIES...are CATS.

A CAT SURGEON draws the sheet back. Looks at the spreadeagled BUSTER.
And brandishes a big nasty pair of GARDEN SHEARS.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The Dark Town audience is scratching its collective head at Buster's
dream, which is showing in one of HYP'S NIGHTMARE ORBS. An angry HYPNOS
slams down the phone and storms across the dance floor to his big
circular bed.

                           HYPNOS
            Dog dreams!! That stinkin' monkey. I can't
            believe it. We give him a body, and he sends us
            ...dogs.

A FELINE BEAUTY embraces him from behind, pulls him onto the bed.

                           KITTY
            Let's not think about dogs. Let's think about
            pussycats. Meeowwwwwwrrrr....

She draws ONE SHARP CLAW lightly down his chest. He gives her a now-
you're-talkin' grin and hits a switch - causing the big circular bed to
ROTATE off the dance floor and into the boudoir.

As it turns, we see KITTY'S PAW closing discreetly around a KEY CHAIN on
the nightstand...

INT. DUNGEON - RIGHT

STU's curled up on the dank floor when he's awakened by the sound of a
VISITOR in the corridor outside - KITTY. She passes a sack containing
FOOD and BOTTLED WATER through the bars - and SHUSHES the astonished STU
before he can speak.

                           KITTY
            Shh! You'll need it when you're traveling.

Glancing back at the GUARDS, she pulls a KEY from her cleavage.

                           KITTY
            Don't ask where I got it.

                           STU
            You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!

                           KITTY
            You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You
            find a way back to that girl of yours and make
            her happy.

                           STU
            How am I gonna get past the guards?

                           KITTY
            I'll worry about the guards.
                 (loudly)

            OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

She turns down the corridor. STU stands there for a beat, GAPING at the
key in his hand.

Then he hears the sound of CARNAGE outside. A FEROCIOUS, BLOODY BATTLE
seems to be underway. Realizing that KITTY must be in trouble, he uses
the key to unlock the dungeon door.

INT. DUNGEON - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours, surrounded by blood
and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARD'S HAT.

                           KITTY
            Go. Just go.

                           STU
            Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--

She looks up at him, feline eyes aglow. There's a three-foot-long
RODENT'S TAIL dangling out of her mouth.

                           STU
            I'll really...never...forget you.

He races off as KITTY resumes her feast. The sound of fighting has
roused the other DUNGEON DWELLERS, and when they realize the dungeon
door is open they come rushing out en masse.

Then the PANEL opens. They hear FOOD raining down behind them. HITCHCOCK
is the first to turn back - then STEPHEN KING - then ATILLA. A moment
later they're back to their old habits, climbing over one another to get
at a half-empty box of Raisinets.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. SLEEP LAB - DAY

The usual gang sitting around at their computer terminals, etc. JULIE is
coolly reading NOTEBOOK ENTRIES into a TAPE RECORDER.

                           JULIE

            They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins.
            Wires got crossed between hands and feet.

                           CLARISSA
            Great lead. I'll try and find it on the net.

                           JULIE
            "4/18: Subject climbs backyard tree...to perform
            elimination. When confronted with product...
            blames it on family dog."

DEAD SILENCE from the mortified group. They never had a case like that
at Johns Hopkins. JULIE somehow keeps a stiff upper lip - deeply
embarrassed for STU, but a scientist nonetheless.

                           HUTCH
            Seems perfectly obvious. He's been possessed by
            a monkey!

The others all GLOWER at HUTCH for this egregious display of bad taste.

EXT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

STU-BONE and HERB are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a
crew of ZOO WORKERS load MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a pickup.

                           HERB
            You're really gonna pop the question?

                           STU-BONE
            Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as
            they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and
            it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.

                           HERB
            I can't believe you. You used to hate being the
            center of attention. Now you're proposing, in
            public, at a benefit.

                           STU-BONE
            Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity
            now, do I really want to get married? But on the
            other hand, if you're married, they can't
            testify against you.

HERB wonders if this is a joke, decides it is, and forces a chuckle.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

JULIE is getting dressed for the benefit when the PHONE RINGS.

                           JULIE
            Hello? Oh, Hutch - what?

INTERCUT - JULIE AND HUTCH

HUTCH is at the sleep lab, standing over the open refrigerator.

                           HUTCH
            The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody
            switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!

                           JULIE
            Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -

Her eyes move to the WINDOW - to STU-BONE out by the garage.

                           JULIE
            Okay. Call the police. I'll be right over.

INT. SLEEP LAB - LATE AFTERNOON

Two DETECTIVES examining the scene of the crime.

                           JULIE
            The technical name is Oneirix. It's an enzyme.
            It's present in the brains of -

                           DETECTIVE
                 (cutting her off; writing)
            Yeah, yeah...Nightmare juice.

                           DETECTIVE II
            And there's been no sign of a break-in?

                           HUTCH
            Holy shit...the pants.
                 (remembering)
            The janitor found a pair of torn-up pants. It
            was the same night the monkey tipped her cage
            over. Remember that, Julie?

                           JULIE
                 (suddenly afraid)
            Yeah...I remember it vividly.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

LIVERIED WAITERS scurrying all about in preparation for the benefit. ZOO
WORKERS set up tables and chairs underneath a giant CANOPY.

STU-BONE watches with satisfaction as the last of the DOLLS is loaded
into a giant piñata in the shape of STANLEY.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The big creaky swivel chair swings around, revealing DEATH.

                           DEATH
            Now, if I may ask - what kind of idiot sneaks
            into the Land of Death twice?

The party he's addressing is STU - who's stretched out horizontally,
strapped to a medieval TORTURE RACK, with a whole posse of GRIM REAPERS
standing guard around him.

                           STU
            You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to
            be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both
            mad at Hypnos.

                           DEATH
            Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all
            his idea. You were completely innocent -

                           STU
            I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E-
            ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right
            in the face to get it - and I'd do the same
            again.

                           DEATH
            Why??

                           STU
            I have a girl up there. And I never - I
            should've - I just want to tell her I love her.

                           DEATH
            I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I enjoy

            my job. Why does everyone want to make it
            difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching
            bodies...it is so irresponsible.

                           STU
            Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my
            soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me
            just one lousy hour.

                           DEATH
            Well - you'd need a body.

DEATH gestures for the REAPERS to unshackle STU.

                           DEATH
            If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I
            wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is
            darned hard to come by.
                 (chortling)
            That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake
            out of the urinal - I thought I would die.

                           STU
            Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.

                           DEATH
            De nada. Now, come here...bend over...before I
            change my mind.

                           STU
            Bend over?

DEATH rears back and KICKS HIM, full-force, SMACK IN THE ASS. The
supernatural might of the blow sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD THROUGH THE
CEILING!!

INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY

A TEAM OF SURGEONS. The lead SURGEON has his arm buried up to the elbow
in the open torso of an ORGAN DONOR.

                           SURGEON
            Okay...detaching the left kidney...

SCREAMS ALL AROUND as the ORGAN DONOR sits BOLT UPRIGHT! The startled
SURGEON drops the kidney back into place.

                           ORGAN DONOR
            What the - who the hell am I??

                           SURGEON
            You're an organ donor!

                           ORGAN DONOR
            Am I dead?!?

                           SURGEON
            The chute didn't open. We kind of assumed -

                           ORGAN DONOR
            I need this body. Just for a few minutes. I'll
            bring it back, okay?

The ORGAN DONOR grabs a lab coat from a nearby rack and races out. (And
since STU is temporarily occupying the DONOR's body, we will henceforth
refer to him as O.D. STU.)


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

O.D. STU comes racing around a corridor. His LAB COAT is already covered
with gore, and he's having trouble holding his GUTS in. His PANCREAS
spills out onto the floor just as two DOCTORS stroll past.

                           DOCTOR
                 (eyeing the pancreas)
            Might have someone take a look at that.

                        O.D. STU
            Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

The DOCTORS move on. O.D. STU spots a JANITOR'S CART with a roll of DUCT
TAPE on one shelf. He WRAPS IT TIGHTLY around his midsection to keep his
innards from falling out. Then he runs for it.

Now the TEAM OF SURGEONS rounds the corner in hot pursuit. The lead
SURGEON spots O.D. STU at the end of the corridor and takes off after
him. But he SLIPS on the PANCREAS and goes sprawling!

The pancreas goes flying down the hall, where it gets SQUASHED in rapid
succession by a GURNEY and by a little old lady's MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR.
When the SURGEONS retrieve it, it's a hunk of pulp.

                           LEAD SURGEON
            I think it can still be saved. Put it on ice.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

GUESTS are beginning to arrive for the benefit. In the cages and
habitats, animals stare up at a gigantic MONKEYBONE BALLOON.

EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

The BAZOOM TOY REP is rounding a corner when HERB pops out from behind a
tree and BLASTS HIM with a jolt of purple gas from a Monkeybone doll! He
sputters and coughs...

Then he grabs the doll away and blasts HERB right back! The two of them
chase each other around the tree, giggling. The BAZOOM REP'S WIFE, in
her formal gown, affects a look of supreme mortification.

EXT. STU'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

O.D. STU climbs over the fence, finds a hidden key, and lets himself in.

INT. HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

O.D. STU rushes frantically from room to room.

                           O.D. STU (o.s.)
            DOC? DOC?? - JULIE?

No reply - the joint's empty. O.D. STU enters the studio and spots a
NEWSPAPER on his drafting table. The paper is folded back to a big
DISPLAY AD for the benefit: "MEET STU MILEY AND MONKEYBONE - 8 PM
TONIGHT!" He checks the wall clock: time is short.

Reaching into the drawer of the drafting table, he pulls out a TACKLE
BOX which contains old brushes...and a small VELVET BOX. O.D. STU opens
the velvet box to reveal Grandma's ANTIQUE RING.

He hears GROWLING behind him - it's BUSTER. The dog looks up, cocks his
head - and begins WAGGING HIS TAIL. Somehow, even though STU's in a
different body, BUSTER recognizes him.

EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

O.D. STU exits, ring in hand. Behind him, BUSTER is throwing a fit -
barking, FLINGING himself at the screen door. He wants to come along!

A BUS pulls up at the corner, and O.D. STU boards it. BUSTER throws
everything he's got at the door - and it gives! He takes off after STU.

EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY

As HERB is walking toward the refreshment table, an ODD LOOK crosses his
face. All at once he begins to TUG at his collar. He yanks his TIE off
...doffs his JACKET onto the pavement...

POV HERB - PSYCHO-VISION

The nightmare drug is kicking in! The whole zoo SWIMS around him. All at
once he's being ATTACKED...by a HORDE of EMPTY CLOTHES!!

EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY

JULIE has arrived at the zoo. She's wandering zombie-like through the
food court, flanked by her friends ALICE and CLARISSA.

                           JULIE
            Whatever he's done, I'm responsible for it.

                           CLARISSA
            That's not true, Julie. It's not true.

                           ALICE
            This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could
            be innocent people in danger.

                           CLARISSA
            He's not the same guy. He's not your Stu.
                 (beat)
            I didn't want to tell you this, but the other
            day he pinched me on the butt.

                           ALICE
            I didn't want to tell you this, but the other
            day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you
            have to tell the police.

                           JULIE
            Tell them what? I don't know anything concrete.
            All I have is a feeling.

All of a sudden, they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the
reptile house. In the distance, ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a NAKED
MAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers.

                           CLARISSA
            Oh my God, we've got a flasher.

                           JULIE
            That...that's Herb!

The GUARDS catch hold of HERB and drag him away past JULIE, ALICE, and
CLARISSA. He doesn't recognize any of them. He's PSYCHOTIC:

                           HERB
            CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They're working
            together. All of them. Shirts...pants...
            ENSEMBLES...!

The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.

INT. MUNI BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

PASSENGERS are holding their noses, frantically pulling on the BELL ROPE
to alert the driver that they want off. As we move toward the back we
see O.D. STU sitting alone, with rows of empty seats on either side.

He looks rough. He's bone-white, his taped-up lab coat is crusted with
blood, and he never did find any shoes. Also, it's a hot night and he's
starting to get a little ripe. FLIES are buzzing all around him.

EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

BUSTER runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will
carry him, in pursuit of the BUS.

INT. CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

The team of SURGEONS has been tracking O.D. STU across the city! Through
the windshield they see the BUS pulling up outside the zoo. O.D. STU
hops out and sprints across the parking lot.

                           SURGEON
            IT'S HIM! HE'S GETTING OFF!

INT. ZOO - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

O.D. STU doesn't even stop at the ticket window. He VAULTS over the
turnstile, knocking benefit guests aside. The SURGEONS aren't far
behind. They race up to the ticket window -

                           SURGEON
            Did you see a corpse running this way?

The TICKET-TAKER shrugs and points off in O.D. STU's direction.

INT. BANQUET TENT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

The last stages of dinner. WAITERS are already clearing plates, and
although JULIE has barely touched her food she sends her plate away.

Onstage a BAND is playing tasteful zoo jazz. When the number ends, STU-
BONE approaches the dais and leans into the mike.

                           STU-BONE
            As emcee I want to thank you all for joining us
            at this swingin' bash...it's a special night for
            the birds, and the lions, and the monkeys, but
            it's also a special night for -
                 (tapping his chest)
            - this monkey. And it's special because of a
            very special lady. Her name is -
                 (checking a note in his pocket)
            Julie McElroy. Just kiddin', Julie. Stand up.

JULIE stands reluctantly. The CROWD APPLAUDS.

                           STU-BONE
            And to make this special night extra-special,
            I'd like to do a special number...especially for
            you.

A DISCO BALL lowers. STU-BONE turns to welcome a group of BACKUP SOUL
SINGERS who are just joining the band on stage.

The TENT begins to ROCK with a throbbing beat. And STU-BONE launches
into a wild-eyed, hip-shaking parody of Mick Jagger singing the Rolling
Stones' "MONKEY MAN"!

As he sings, STU-BONE gyrates over toward JULIE, bumping and grinding
like the cartoon-monkey sex machine he is. He waves his mike to the
crowd, urging everyone to join in. JULIE gasps in disbelief, but the
crowd is eating it up - clapping and singing along with STU-BONE.

He gestures for pretty women to join him out on the floor. He opens his
shirt at the neck, exposing a hitherto unseen plenitude of chest hair.

He pulls out a hanky to mop his brow and tosses it to the crowd. He
wipes his armpits with a second hanky and tosses it to the crowd. He
blows his nose into a third and tosses it to the crowd.

Then he JUMPS UP ON THE TABLES and shakes his booty wildly,­ strutting in
and out among the dessert plates. If the real Jagger could see him, he
would creep home a sad and broken man.

For the big finale, he jumps off the table and SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR
to JULIE'S table - arriving ON HIS KNEES.

                           STU-BONE
            I am just a Monkey Man! I'm glad you are a
            monkey...woman...too.
                 (soft voice)

            How about it, Julie?

He pulls out a RING BOX and hands it to the beet-red JULIE. The crowd
lets out a collective GASP - followed by WILD APPLAUSE.

She stares down at the ring - a big vulgar sparkler. She can't speak.

                           STU-BONE
            We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony.
            An Abba Dabba honeymoon!

                           JULIE
            It looks so...new.

                           STU-BONE
            It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?

                           JULIE
            But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's
            ring...

                           STU-BONE
            Heirloom? Huh? You want a used ring - ?

No reply. She's taking a long time to say yes. The audience is
muttering.

                           STU-BONE
            Ju-leeee... Operators are standing by... Offer
            expires at midnight, December 31...

Suddenly a GORE-STAINED FIGURE bursts into the tent.

                           O.D. STU
            DOC! DOC! DON'T DO IT! HE ISN'T STU! HE'S
            MONKEYBONE!!!

JULIE's jaw drops. She barely gets a glimpse of O.D. STU before the ZOO
GUARDS arrive to haul him away.

                           STU-BONE
            Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep
            call you - ?

                           JULIE
            He called me "Doc."

- which STU-BONE never does. Someone in the crowd yells...

                           GUEST
            HEY MONKEYBONE!!

STU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd.

                           STU-BONE
            That's me, folks! Monkeybone! Let's party!

By the time he's done scratching his ribs, JULIE has vanished!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

She races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD.

                           JULIE
            Please. Where did you take that man...?

The GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering
out through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet...

                           JULIE
            Who are you? Why did you say those things?

                           O.D. STU
            Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land
            of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he
            got my body, see? All they had left for me was
            this corpse!

JULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away.

                           O.D. STU
            Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give
            people nightmares!
                 (no response)

            Doc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They
            were pulling the plug - I called out to you -
            and you heard me. Remember?

This stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single
tear rolling down her cheek. And then...

                           JULIE
            BUSTER?!?

The dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van,
barking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns -

                           JULIE
            Stu...how?

                           O.D. STU
            I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you
            this.

THROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's
antique ring.

                           O.D. STU
            I meant to give it to you before. The night we
            crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to
            remember me like that, okay? Not like this.

She slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS
WELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise.

                           JULIE
            What's wrong?

                           O.D. STU
            I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm
            all dried up.

JULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just
arrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over.

                           ALICE
            Detective, please let this man out of the van.

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - PIÑATA AREA - THAT MOMENT

The PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PIÑATA,
which is hanging from a tree. A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a good
hard whack. CRACKS are beginning to appear...

                           STU-BONE
            Okay, folks, it's piñata time - you know the
            rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it's
            all for the benefit of our friends the animals!
                 (eyes brightening)
            Oooooh! This one's on me!

The next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN. He blindfolds her and embraces
her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat.

                           STU-BONE
            Choke up, baby. That's right. Choke up!

Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in
tow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE -

- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as
the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS...

                           ORGANIZER
            I don't understand, officer. This is a benefit.
            Surely this can wait until -

                           COP
            Sorry, ma'am...we need to question Mr. Miley on
            a most urgent matter.

                           JULIE
            Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been tampered
            with. They're toxic!

O.D. STU comes marching through the crowd. He passes a LIFE-SIZED
DISPLAY of Stanley and Monkeybone...GRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley
figure...and proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE.

                           O.D. STU
            MONKEYBONE...BACK IN THE PACK.

The old command seems to retain its magical power, because STU-BONE
clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it.

                           O.D. STU
            I mean it this time. Back in the pack.

STU-BONE bends over - jerks and twitches - becoming more SIMIAN by the
moment as O.D. STU approaches.

                           STU-BONE
            Stu...I can explain...I was sick of being a
            figment, see? It's awful being a figment. It's
            degrading! And I never really wanted to give
            people nightmares. I just told 'em that so
            they'd help me get a body.

                           O.D. STU
            Yeah - my body. Back in the pack, you simian
            shitbird!

The COPS are tres confused by all this -

                           COP
            Ma'am, can you give me some idea of what's going
            on here?

- but JULIE holds them back so the scene can play itself out. Now STU-
BONE is doing a weird little monkey dance - PLAYING UP to the puzzled
crowd, who laugh and snicker, wondering what to make of all this.

                           STU-BONE
            Laugh, damn you...laugh at the sidekick...the
            happy little monkey. He doesn't have any
            feelings. He's just a figment of your
            immagination!

He turns suddenly - GRABS THE BAT from the puzzled BABE -

                           STU-BONE
            GIMME THAT GODDAM BAT!

He wails on the piñata like Ken Griffey Jr. O.D. STU tries to stop him,
but it's too late - the piñata BURSTS, and hundreds of PURPLE-ASSED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS spill out onto the ground!

An equal number of RABID PARTYGOERS surge forward to scoop them up. The
COPS swing into action, trying to hold the crowd back...

                           COP
            HE'S GETTING AWAY!

STU-BONE climbs a tree and JUMPS from a branch onto one of the TWIN
JUNGLE TOWERS at the pavilion - begins CLIMBING toward the giant
MONKEYBONE BALLOON moored up above!

O.D. STU sees him - pulls away from JULIE -

                           O.D. STU
            I LOVE YOU!

                           JULIE
            STU!!

STU-BONE unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection. Now
freed, the balloon LIFTS INTO THE AIR, CARRYING HIM ALOFT!

O.D. STU climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift
away. He GRABS HOLD of the MOORING ROPE as it whips past.

And the TEAM OF SURGEONS - who have been combing the grounds in search
of O.D. STU - catch sight of him just as he FLOATS OFF INTO THE AIR, ON
THE END OF THE ROPE!

                           HEAD SURGEON
            LOOK! IT'S HIM!


EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - ON BALLOON - MOVING

They rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet. But O.D. STU's
additional weight pulls the balloon back DOWN - and both of them hit the
ground! They have to RUN at top speed just to keep pace with the
balloon!

                           STU-BONE
            Let...go...you...dingleberry...

As he's trying to KICK O.D. STU off the rope, a GUST OF WIND catches the
balloon and LIFTS IT HIGH INTO THE AIR.

For about three seconds. The boys tumble to earth, off-balance, in a
heap, BOUNCING along the pavement. The balloon pulls them over a
WROUGHT-IRON FENCE and drags them through the ALLIGATOR PIT. Giant jaws
snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook.

As the balloon LIFTS UP AGAIN, O.D. STU hauls himself along the length
of the rope.

He gets close enough to GRAB STU-BONE's LEG. STU-BONE reaches down to
push him away...grabs a fistful of DUCT TAPE...

...and RIP! The tape TEARS - exposing the great big GASH in O.D. STU's
midsection! He tries to pull himself together...

EXT. FOOD COURT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

A SERVER ladles out a cup of PUNCH from a big silver PUNCHBOWL.
Something PINK comes plummeting out of the sky - and the next thing he
knows, the SERVER is DRENCHED!

The SURGEONS come rushing up. They all stick their hands in the
punchbowl at once...fishing out O.D. STU'S KIDNEY!

                           HEAD SURGEON
            Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved!

One of the TEAM finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks. In it goes.

EXT. TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

BOTH BOYS SCREAM as the balloon drags them perilously close to the RAZOR
WIRE atop a tall storm fence.

They clear it by inches - but they don't have much time to celebrate.
They're dangling over the Bengal Tiger exhibit, and the great cats are
LEAPING INTO THE AIR trying to snag them!

As O.D. STU squirms out of reach, his LIVER drops out...

EXT. GROUNDS - TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

It lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he
can reach it. He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL
TIGERS racing toward him! He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but
a TIGER gets the other end -

- and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending
the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars! The
HEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver...

                           HEAD SURGEON
            Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved.

ANGLE ON BALLOON

STU-BONE socks O.D. STU hard across the face! He lets go of his incision
...and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out! Since it's still connected at both
ends, the intestine forms a great big LOOP...

EXT. FOOD COURT - SERVING TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON

The SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean
punch. He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful
when STU flies past overhead. His intestinal LOOP slides across the
table, knocking over glasses, snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base...

...and YANKING IT right off the table! Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED in
punch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END...

...and, with the sound of a GONG being struck, BEANS a member of the
SURGICAL TEAM from behind!! Naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ICE
CHEST full of O.D. STU's organs. When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES
DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...

... at a pair of COPS who are over by the piñata, loading CONFISCATED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART. The ICE CHEST knocks them off
their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!

The COPS try to get up, but they skid every which way on the SPILLED ICE
underneath. On top of which, the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them, playing
GRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs.

The HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got
BEANED by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse.

                           HEAD SURGEON
            Put him on ice. I think he can still be saved!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

COPS sprint downhill, trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART full
of confiscated dolls. Too late. The CART slams into a fence and goes
ass-over-teakettle, dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT...

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

HYPNOS and an audience of DARKTOWNERS peer into the nightmare orb. They
see a Keystone-Cops vision of fur-clad ESKIMOS, with clubs and
spearguns, amid a colony of terrified PENGUINS.

                           HYPNOS
            Not again. THAT STINKING MONKEY!!!

AERIAL SHOT - STU'S POV - MOVING

STU gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling INTESTINE. He begins
FEEDING IT OUT - giving himself more rope to work with - and when it's
long enough, begins SWINGING IT like a LASSO!

EXT. WATER BUFFALO HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

WATER BUFFALO graze Buddha-like as STU'S INTESTINE snags one of them
around the HORNS. The lasso draws taut - and holds!

ANGLE ON BALLOON - O.D. STU AND STU-BONE

The balloon is moored in place again! O.D. STU pulls himself upward,
toward STU-BONE, who KICKS AT him frantically!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

A COP pulls his sidearm and TAKES AIM at the now-stabilized balloon.

                           COP
            I think I can bring 'em down.

ANGLE ON BALLOON - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

BLAM! The cop's shot hits the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON smack in the ass.
With a gale-force helium FART, the balloon ZOOMS UPWARD. The INTESTINE
snaps. STU-BONE and O.D. STU shoot off into the air!


ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - AERIAL

AT APOGEE. They exchange a LOOK as the last gasp of helium hisses out of
the gigantic balloon. Then it occurs to them to look DOWN...

THEIR POV - PARKING LOT - OVERHEAD ANGLE

...at the tiny CARS parked far, far below. They must be close to a
hundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up
fast!

EXT. ZOO - ON JULIE & CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON

JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.


ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - FALLING

...and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the
parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.

Their BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling...

AERIAL SHOT - SKIES OVER DARK TOWN - NIGHT

...and the fight continues - even into the afterlife! As they plummet
down through the heavens, they REVERT to their true personae. It's STU
vs. MONKEYBONE, creator vs. sidekick, still duking it out - like a
couple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute!

EXT. STREETS - DARK TOWN - RIGHT

DARKTOWNERS pour into the streets to watch the epic struggle overhead.
They're placing bets, rooting their favorites on. Then...

THE GROUND SHAKES AND THUNDERS - and the DARKTOWNERS scatter in all
directions, DIVING for the nearest hiding place. They seem to know what
this mighty rumbing signifies.

The E-TICKET RIDE pops out of the ground - begins to RISE into the air -
and a COLOSSUS appears beneath it! A FIFTY-FOOT WARRIOR clad in JAPANESE
CEREMONIAL ARMOR, he TOWERS over Dark Town, so mighty and enormous that
he can wear the E-TICKET RIDE as a hat!!

ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - FALLING

STU lands a HAYMAKER, and the two of them break loose of each other -


ON ARMORED COLOSSUS - THAT MOMENT

- LANDING in the upturned palms of the COLOSSUS! STU watches in
disbelief as a PANEL pops open in the giant's CHEST, revealing...

                           STU
            DEATH!!

                           DEATH
            I dress up when I want to make an impression. -
            So how'd it go?

                           STU
            Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye,
            everything's gonna be okay.
                 (shrugging)
            I guess I'm yours now.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Death, I'd like to point out that none of this
            was my fault. The roots of this tragedy go back
            to a callous, uncaring society that -

DEATH lets out a MIGHTY ROAR and CLAPS HIS GREAT METAL HANDS together.
Man and monkey are surely squished. But when DEATH opens his hands, STU
is still there, cupped safely in his palms.

                           STU
            Hey. Where's Monkeybone?

                           DEATH
            Back in your head, where he belongs.
                 (beat)
            No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda
            vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without
            him.

                           STU
            Back? You're sending me back?

                           DEATH
            It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of
            yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus"
            guy instead.

                           STU
            Death! Thank you!

                           DEATH
            Thank me next time you see me.

He sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD INTO THE STRATOSPHERE with a single flick
of his finger. Then he turns...

                           DEATH
            Ohhhh, Hypnos??

A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the
middle of the town square.

                           HYPNOS
            Death! So nice to see you. I can explain -

He looks up tremulously. A GIANT SHADOW falls across him...followed by a
GIANT ARMORED FOOT.

EXT. ZOO - DUSK

JULIE SOBS in a POLICEMAN's arms at the exit to the zoo.

                           JULIE
            I don't know what happened. All I know is...he
            was in a coma...and then he came back...and now
            he's gone again.

They wander out. Behind them, a squad of COPS are confiscating
MONKEYBONE DOLLS from squawling children as they file out.


EXT. ZOO - PARKING LOT - DUSK

The TWO CORPSES, on gurneys, are being loaded into the back of the
police ambulance. The SURGEON and his team come wandering up.

                           SURGEON
            Excuse me. We lost a corpse - we saw him heading
            this way...

                           DRIVER
            I got a couple of fresh ones in the back. Help
            yourself.

The SURGEON pulls the sheet off CORPSE #1 - aka O.D. STU.

                           SURGEON
            I'll be. It's him all right. Still dead...

The SECOND CORPSE sits up abruptly. His sheet falls away, revealing STU
...the real STU...now back in his own body! The SURGEON and his TEAM run
away from the ambulance SHRIEKING.

EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

BUSTER barks like a maniac. JULIE turns and sees an IMPOSSIBLE VISION
ambling toward her...STU, alive and kicking. She can't believe it's him
until he grabs her and pulls her close.

                           JULIE
            Is it you? Is it really you this time?

He pulls her close and kisses her long and hard, quelling all doubts.

                           JULIE
            Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.

                           STU
            Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.

They wander off, arm in arm. STU TUGS at the seat of his pants.

                           JULIE
            What's the matter?

                           STU
            My tail itches.

He DOES A TAKE as he realizes what he's just said - but JULIE smiles,
and he shrugs it off. Johnny Mercer's "DREAM" comes up underneath as the
reunited lovers walk off into the moonlight, and we

                                                   FADE OUT.
"THE MUMMY"

                                            by

                                     Stephen Sommers

                

               The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on 
               the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT 
               rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, 
               it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until 
               the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves 
               DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not 
               ancient.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

                                    THEBES - 2,134 B.C

               Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

                                     NARRATOR
                         Thebes. City of the Living. Crown 
                         jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

               The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn 
               CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; 
               an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

               INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK

               Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, 
               muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Home of Imhotep, High Priest of 
                         Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

               A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It 
               takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's 
               wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked 
               body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a 
               stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's 
                         Mistress. No other man was allowed 
                         to touch her.

               She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA 
               comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then 
               it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking 
               TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand 
               nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their 
               eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains.

               Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, 
               feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, 
               smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust:

                                     NARRATOR
                         But for our love, we were willing to 
                         risk life itself.

               And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself 
               on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush 
               over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors 
               suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at 
               the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- 
               SUBTITLED.

                                     PHARAOH
                         What are you doing here?

               The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival 
               was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws 
               them back.

               Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh 
               sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger.

                                     PHARAOH
                         WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!

               From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. 
               Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

                                     PHARAOH
                         Imhotep?... My priest.

               Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               his back.

               Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous 
               bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the 
               curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep 
               stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from 
               the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and 
               look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers 
               share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and 
               grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony.

                                     PRIESTS
                         Pharaoh's bodyguards!

               Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's 
               sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         You must go. Save yourself. Only you 
                         can resurrect me.

               Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN.

               MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over 
               their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the 
               MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony 
               just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.

               Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses --

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         My body is no longer his temple!

               She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, 
               Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream...

                                     NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
                         For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's 
                         body was to be cursed. And it was I, 
                         the High Priest, whose duty it was 
                         to curse it.

               EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT

               Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-
               su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her 
               down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Her body was mummified, her vital 
                         organs removed and placed in sacred 
                         canopic jars.

               Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of 
               pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The Book of The Living contained 
                         sacred incantations that would send 
                         the evil dead on a journey into the 
                         dark underworld.

               Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves 
               and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled 
               eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.

               Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, 
               and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the 
               ground.

               Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.

               The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. 
               Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears 
               at the Nubians. Killing them.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The slaves were killed...

               Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed 
               Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as 
               Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ...and the soldiers who killed them 
                         were also slain, so that no unholy 
                         person should ever know the exact 
                         location of the burial site.

               The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the 
               Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
               vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant 
               dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's 
               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

               EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT

               CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the 
               way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF 
               ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But there was another book, The Book 
                         Of The Dead, which was never to be 
                         opened, never to be read, for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing.

               The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
               They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

                              HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead

                                     IMHOTEP
                         It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of 
                         the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace Egypt.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT

               Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT 
               inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and 
               lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But for my love of Anck-su-namun I 
                         was willing to defy the gods.

               INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT

               Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the 
               headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.

               A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of 
               filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The 
               Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless 
               eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and 
               forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.

               In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.

               Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless 
               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun's vital organs were 
                         still fresh, so a human sacrifice 
                         would not need be made.

               As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large 
               SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several 
               Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back 
               down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the 
               swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them 
               and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the 
               heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING 
               HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are 
               reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun soul had come back 
                         from the dead! Now all that was 
                         needed, was to return her organs to 
                         their rightful place within her body.

               Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's 
               breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and 
               BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and 
               storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES 
               the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks 
               back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the 
               swirling hole.

               Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS 
               in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         My Priests were condemned to be 
                         mummified alive.

               INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT

               Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed 
               EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic 
               glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.

               The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and 
               thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING 
               Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

               A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

               A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His 
               eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red 
               hot poker up his nose.

               But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, 
               horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

               WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests 
               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.

               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         As for me, I was condemned to endure 
                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient 
                         curses. One so horrible, it had never 
                         before been bestowed.

               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's 
               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on 
               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is 
               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue 
               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.

               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and 
               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus 
               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the 
               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.

               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.

               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.

               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the 
               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting 
               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.

               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would 
                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And 
                         by eating me, they were cursed just 
                         the same.

               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange 
               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.

               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a 
               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia 
               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         I was to remain sealed inside my 
                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of 
                         eternity.

               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle 
               BOX.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         They would never allow me to be 
                         released. For I would arise a walking 
                         disease, a plague upon mankind, an 
                         unholy flesh-eater, with the strength 
                         of ages, power over the sands, and 
                         the glory of invincibility.

               Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The 
               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and 
               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
                         su-namun from her place in hell, 
                         together, we would be an unstoppable 
                         infection upon this world. The 
                         Apocalypse. The End.

               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming 
               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt 
               onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM:

                                        THE MUMMY

               The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave.

               Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, 
               the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins 
               to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only 
               seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-
               buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

               EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY

               Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG 
               HORSEMAN.

               Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior 
               brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN 
               are the WORDS:

                                    THE SAHARA - 1925

               A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN 
               LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the 
               onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a 
               jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.

               He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at 
               him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I knew this was gonna be a lousy 
                         day.

               A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across 
               the top of the wall. This is BENI.

                                     BENI
                         Personally, I would like to surrender. 
                         Why can we not just surrender?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

               Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's run away. Right now. While 
                         we can still make it.

               O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now gimme your revolver, you'll never 
                         use it anyway.

               Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody 
                         ever does that anymore.

               O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now go find me a big stick.

                                     BENI
                         In the desert? What for?

               O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So I can tie it to your back, you 
                         appear to be without a spine.

               The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. 
               Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How'd a guy like you end up in the 
                         Legion anyways?

                                     BENI
                         I got caught robbing a synagogue. 
                         Lots of good stuff in them holy 
                         places; churches, temples, mosques, 
                         and who's guarding them?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Altar boys?

                                     BENI
                         Exactly! I speak seven languages, 
                         including Hebrew, so my specialty 
                         was synagogues. How about you? Kill 
                         somebody?

               Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.

               O'Connell gives him a nasty look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No, but I'm considering it.

               They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

                                     BENI
                         What then? Robbery? Extortion? 
                         Kidnapping!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None of the above, thank you.

                                     BENI
                         Then what the hell are you doing 
                         here!?

               They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the 
               horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.

               O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was just looking for a good time.

               And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly 
               panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh shit. Steady!

               Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde 
               Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I sayin'?

               The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog 
               SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I doin'?

               The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels 
               himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly 
               snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with 
               a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their 
               mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.

               The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the 
               hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off 
               their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg 
               force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.

               O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING 
               riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

               Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, 
               whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all 
               around him. He crawls through the front gate.

               O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He 
               cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off 
               their mounts.

               Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY 
               amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as 
               the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind 
               him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Son-of-a-bitch.

               He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.

               Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.

               O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.

               He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the 
               heavy sandstone door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey! Beni! Wait up!

               Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are ya doing?! Wait up!

               O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen 
               LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU 
                         CLOSE THAT DOOR!

               Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell 
               SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm gonna get you for this!

               He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his 
               life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer 
               and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.

               O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The 
               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The 
               vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.

               O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he 
               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

               And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them 
               REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The 
               horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like 
               fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared 
               them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their 
               mounts.

               O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right 
               hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the 
               evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit 
               statue of Anubis stares back at him.

               Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.

               He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming 
               sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing 
               beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.

               O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The 
               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the 
               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

               EXT. RIDGE - DAY

               Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence 
               and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have 
               BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.

               The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this 
               time.

               The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with 
               dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome 
               and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark 
               eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...

               EXT. CAIRO - DAY

               Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their 
               positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with 
               every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.

               WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:

                                          CAIRO

               INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon 
               rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the 
               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between 
               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, 
               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- 
               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.

               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with 
               her.

               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows 
               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books 
               whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs 
               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up 
                         here?

               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her 
               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles 
               begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long 
               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down 
               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too 
               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder 
               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn 
               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the 
               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, 
               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her 
               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts 
               stiltwalking down the aisle.

                                     EVELYN
                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!

               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads 
               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling 
               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and 
               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into 
               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES 
               into the next bookshelf.

               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She 
               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf 
               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after 
               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and 
               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last 
               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She 
               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other 
               eye and stares at the huge mess.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oops.

               The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.

                                     CURATOR
                         Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! 
                         Give me frogs, flies, locusts, 
                         anything but this! Compared to you, 
                         the other plagues were a joy!

               Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm sorry, it was an accident.

                                     CURATOR
                         When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it 
                         was an accident. You are a 
                         catastrophe! Why do I put up with 
                         you?

               Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

                                     EVELYN
                         You put up with me, because I can 
                         read and write ancient Egyptian, 
                         decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, 
                         and I'm the only person within a 
                         thousand miles who knows how to 
                         properly code and catalogue this 
                         library.

                                     CURATOR
                         Who needs smart women? I put up with 
                         you because your mother and father 
                         were our finest patrons, Allah rest 
                         their souls. Now straighten up this 
                         mess!

               The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.

               And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hello?

               Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly 
               shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

                                     EVELYN
                         Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

               Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --

               INT. THE RAMESSEUM

               Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. 
               It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from 
               FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.

               The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly 
               shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.

               Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they 
               stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She 
               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases 
               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this 
               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks 
               around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans 
               forward with the torch, and peers inside.

               -- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!

               Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out 
               of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, 
               she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad 
               crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half 
               drunk.

                                     EVELYN
                         You...! YOU...!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please 
                         call me something original.

               Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, 
               Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

                                     EVELYN
                         Have you no respect for the dead?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right now, I only wish to join them.

               He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather 
                         than later, before you ruin my career 
                         the way you've ruined yours.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll 
                         have you know, that at this moment 
                         my career is on a high note.

               He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

                                     EVELYN
                         High note? Ha! For five years you've 
                         been scrounging around Egypt, and 
                         what have you to show for it? Nothing.

               Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes I do! I have something right 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh no, not another worthless trinket, 
                         Jonathan, if I bring one more piece 
                         of junk to the Curator to try and 
                         sell for you.

               Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY 
               to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly 
               curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where did you get this?

               Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.

                                     JONATHAN
                         On a dig, down in Thebes.

               Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself 
               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.

               Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My whole life I've never found 
                         anything, Evy. Tell me I've found 
                         something.

               Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the 
               box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle 
               box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, 
               turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box 
               is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.

                                     EVELYN
                         Jonathan?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes?

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you found something.

               INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's 
               eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         See the cartouche there, it's the 
                         official royal seal of Seti the First, 
                         I'm sure of it.

                                     CURATOR
                         Perhaps.

               Jonathan leans in from across the desk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Two questions. Who the hell is Seti 
                         the First? And was he rich?

                                     EVELYN
                         He was the last Pharaoh of the Old 
                         Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest 
                         Pharaoh of them all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Alright, good, that's good. I like 
                         this fellow, like him very much.

               The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I've already dated it, this map is 
                         almost four thousand years old. And 
                         the hieratics over here...
                              (Inhales deeply)
                         It's Hamunaptra.

               The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.

                                     CURATOR
                         My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, 
                         we are scholars, not treasure hunters. 
                         Hamunaptra is a myth.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the 
                         early Pharaohs were said to have 
                         hidden the wealth of Egypt.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right, right, in a big underground 
                         treasure chamber. Everybody knows 
                         the story. The entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand. On 
                         Pharaoh's command, a flick of the 
                         switch! And the whole place could 
                         disappear beneath the dunes.

                                     EVELYN
                         All we know is that the city 
                         mysteriously vanished around 2,134 
                         B.C.

               The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.

                                     CURATOR
                         As the Americans would say: it's all 
                         fairy tales and hokum.

               The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws 
               it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now 
               missing.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You burned it! You burned off the 
                         part with the lost city!

                                     CURATOR
                         It's for the best, I'm sure. Many 
                         men have wasted their lives in the 
                         foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no 
                         one has ever found it, most have 
                         never returned.

                                     JONATHAN
                              (devastated)
                         You killed my map.

                                     CURATOR
                         I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm 
                         surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to 
                         be so fooled.

               The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches 
               it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.

               EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every 
               low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a 
               first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across 
               the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.

                                     EVELYN
                         You told me you found it on a dig 
                         down in Thebes!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I was mistaken.

                                     EVELYN
                         You lied to me!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I lie to everybody, what makes you 
                         so special?

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That just makes you more gullible.

                                     EVELYN
                         You stole it from a drunk at the 
                         local Casbah?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Picked his pocket, actually.

               EXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY

               The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what is he in prison for?

                                     WARDEN
                         I did not know, so when I heard you 
                         were coming, I asked him that myself.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what did he say?

                                     WARDEN
                         He said... he was just looking for a 
                         good time.

               The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, 
               dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.

               From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is 
               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new 
               bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

                                     EVELYN
                         But he's just a filthy criminal?

                                     JONATHAN
                              (cringing)
                         Way to go, Evy.

               O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So who's the broad?

                                     EVELYN
                         Broad?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         She's my sister, actually.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a 
                         total loss.

               Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.

                                     WARDEN
                         I'll be back in a moment.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         I tremble with anticipation.

               A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face 
               bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks 
               back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         We uh,... found... your puzzle box, 
                         and we've come to ask you about it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No.

                                     EVELYN
                         No?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No... You came to ask me about 
                         Hamunaptra.

               Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards 
               didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

                                     EVELYN
                         How do you know the box pertains to 
                         Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's where I found it. I 
                         was there.

               Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

                                     JONATHAN
                         How do we know that's not a load of 
                         pig swallow?

               O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey,... don't I know you?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Um, well, you see...

               O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan 
               square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A 
               Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.

               He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.

               Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         You were actually at Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just decked your brother

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, well...
                              (shrugs)
                         I know my brother.

               O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I was there.

                                     EVELYN
                         You swear?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Every damn day.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, I mean --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         -- I know what you mean. I was there, 
                         alright. Seti's place. The City Of 
                         The Dead.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did you find? What did you see?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I found sand. I saw death.

               The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Could you tell me how to get there? 
                         The exact location?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Want to know?

               Evelyn leans in even closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Really want to know?

               She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

               O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then get me the hell outta here.

               Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off 
               the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, 
               YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where are they taking him?

                                     WARDEN
                         To be hanged.

               Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.

                                     WARDEN
                         Apparently, he had a very good time.

               EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as 
               the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and 
               cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden 
               onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh 
               meat.

                                     WARDEN
                         No women allowed.

                                     EVELYN
                         I am an English woman.

               This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

               O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.

                                     EVELYN
                         I will give you one hundred pounds 
                         to spare his life.

                                     WARDEN
                         I would pay one hundred pounds just 
                         to see him hang.

                                     EVELYN
                         Two hundred pounds.

                                     WARDEN
                         Proceed!

                                     EVELYN
                         Three hundred pounds!

               O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than 
               Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.

                                     HANGMAN
                         Any last requests, pig?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

               The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

                                     EVELYN
                         FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!

               The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.

                                     WARDEN
                         And what else?

               Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

               Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the 
               Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!

               O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then 
               JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.

               But he's still alive, because --

                                     WARDEN
                         His neck did not break! Good! Now we 
                         watch him strangle to death.

               The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.

               The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the 
               end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly 
               turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

                                     EVELYN
                         He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

               The warden spins around and faces her.

                                     WARDEN
                         You lie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I would never!

               At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and 
               turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

                                     WARDEN
                         Are you saying this filthy godless 
                         son of a pig knows where to find The 
                         City Of The Dead? Truly?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes and if you cut him down, we will 
                         give you ten percent.

                                     WARDEN
                         Fifty percent.

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty.

                                     WARDEN
                         Forty.

               Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as 
               he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--
                         !

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty-five percent, and not one 
                         single farthing more.

               The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. 
               A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES 
               to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

               All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up 
               at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

               CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.

                                     CURATOR
                         She must die.

               Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA: 
               blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One 
               of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.

                                     HOOK
                         She is like all the others. She will 
                         die in the desert.

                                     CURATOR
                         No! She has seen too much. She knows 
                         too much.

               The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

                                     CURATOR
                         Not only does she have a map, but 
                         she has the key.

               Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.

                                     HOOK
                         The key!? She has the lost key!?

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes. No one has ever had so much, 
                         been so close. We must stop her, or 
                         it will be the end of us all.

                                     HOOK
                         Then we will kill her, we will kill 
                         her and all those with her.

                                     CURATOR
                         And burn the map and retrieve the 
                         key.

                                     HOOK
                         It will be done. But what of the 
                         American expedition? They leave 
                         tomorrow as well.

                                     CURATOR
                         Forget the bumbling Americans, they 
                         will be like all the others. Without 
                         the map to guide them, how can they 
                         possibly find Hamunaptra?

               EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY

               SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI.

                                     BENI
                         It is three days down the Nile, then 
                         two days by camel, sahibs.

               WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a 
               PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.

                                     DANIELS
                         For all the money we're paying you, 
                         something better god-damned well be 
                         under that sand.

               WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.

                                     HENDERSON
                         "Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya 
                         gotta keep sayin, to yourself, 
                         "Hamunaptra."

               Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the 
               docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn 
               and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS 
               selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you really think he'll show up?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he 
                         may be a cowboy, but his word is his 
                         word.

                                     EVELYN
                         Personally, I think he's filthy, 
                         rude and a complete scoundrel. I 
                         don't like him one bit.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Anyone I know?

               They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit 
               and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more 
               dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh... um,... hello.

               Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Smashing day for the start of an 
                         adventure, eh, O'Connell?

               O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, sure, smashing.

               He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the 
               bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

                                     BURNS
                         You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

                                     BENI
                         Along with the scorched bones of my 
                         entire garrison, sahib.

               And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, 
               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the 
               men.

                                     BENI
                         A thousand pardons, my good sahibs 
                         but there is much work to be done.

               Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

               BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mister O'Connell, can you look me in 
                         the eye, and guarantee me this is 
                         not some sort of flimflam? Because 
                         if it is, I'm warning you --

               O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         All I can tell you, miss, is that my 
                         Colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much, that without 
                         orders, we marched halfway across 
                         Libya and into Egypt to find that 
                         city. Like I told ya, all I saw was 
                         sand. Everybody else was wiped out 
                         by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your 
                         bags.

               O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.

               Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, 
                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to 
                         like there at all.

               Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy 
               hat.

                                     WARDEN
                         A bright good morning to all.

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you doing here?

                                     WARDEN
                         I have come to protect my investment, 
                         thank you very much.

               And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

               WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --

               EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT

               The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA 
               quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one 
               with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two 
               row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

               EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell 
               comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we 
                         could use another good player.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I only gamble with my life, never my 
                         money.

                                     DANIELS
                         Never? What if I were to wager five 
                         hundred dollars says we get to 
                         Hamunaptra before you?

               O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yer on.

               Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

                                     BURNS
                         What makes you so confident, sir?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What makes you?

               Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We got us a man who's actually been 
                         there.

               O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what a coincidence, why --

               O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the 
               gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

                                     JONATHAN
                         -- whose deal is it? Is it my deal? 
                         I thought I just dealt?

               EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

               The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

                                     EVELYN
                         The only thing that scares me, Mister 
                         O'Connell, are your manners.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         If you call that a kiss.

               O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did I miss something? Are we going 
                         into battle?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The last time I was at that place 
                         everybody I was with died.

               This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts 
               dismantling and cleaning the guns.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's something out there, you 
                         know, something under that sand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain 
                         artifact, a book, actually, my brother 
                         thinks there's treasure. What do you 
                         think is out there?

               O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin 
                         believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, 
                         they call it, "the doorway to hell."

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to 
                         the underworld", actually.

               She gives him a know-it-all grin.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't believe in fairy tales and 
                         hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do 
                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there, 
                         The Book Of The Living. It's what 
                         first interested me in Egypt as a 
                         child. It's why I came here, sort of 
                         a life's pursuit.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And the fact that they say it's made 
                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind 
                         to you, right?

               Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know your history.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know my treasure.

               Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns 
               back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

                                     EVELYN
                         By the way,... why did you kiss me?

               O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was about to be hanged, seemed 
                         like a good idea at the time.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

               O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Wha'd I say?

               Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly 
               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

                                     BENI
                         My very good friend! What a surprise.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why if it ain't my little buddy, 
                         Beni. I oughta kill you.

               O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows 
               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

                                     BENI
                         You never were any good with the 
                         ladies, O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So you're the one leading the 
                         Americans, I shoulda figured. So 
                         what's the scam? You get 'em out in 
                         the middle of the desert then leave 
                         'em to rot?

                                     BENI
                         Unfortunately no, these Americans 
                         are smart, they pay me only half 
                         now, half when I get them back to 
                         Cairo, so I must go all the way.

               O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

                                     BENI
                         You never believed in Hamunaptra, 
                         O'Connell. Why are you going back? 
                         The devil himself lives out there.

               They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the 
               HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and 
               backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The girl saved my life, figured it 
                         was the least I could do, keep her 
                         out of trouble.

                                     BENI
                         You always did have more balls than 
                         brains.

               O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Let's make us even, shall we?

                                     BENI
                         Even?

               O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

               Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack 
               and starts walking off down the deck.

                                     BENI (O.S.)
                         O'Connell! I am going to kill you 
                         for this!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sounds familiar.

               And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

               O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

               INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

               She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE 
               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

                                     HOOK
                         Where is the map?

               Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

                                     HOOK
                         And the key? Where is the key?

               Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.

                                     HOOK
                         Then I'll find it myself.

               He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.

               Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

               O'Connell looks at her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Friend of yours?

               Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table 
               FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell 
               spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.

               FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's 
               head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

               FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene 
               SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, 
               right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.

               O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

               HALLWAY - NIGHT

               O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

                                     EVELYN
                         The map! We need the map!

               He shoves her up against a wall.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax! I'm the map!
                              (taps his forehead)
                         It's all up here.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh that's comforting.

               O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, there's still one more of 
                         those guys around here somewhere.

               EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT

               Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye 
               and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on 
               the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks 
               him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!!

               Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A 
               HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine --

               It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.

               Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

               EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
               paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.

               BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.

               O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the 
               other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

               Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the 
               paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their 
               heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The 
               Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep 
               up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now 
               ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Can you swim?

                                     EVELYN
                         Well of course I can swim, if the 
                         occasion calls for it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Trust me.

               He picks her up and throws her over the side.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The occasion calls for it.

               Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after 
               her.

               EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, 
               guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything 
               in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Americans.

               Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.

               Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his 
               FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes 
               widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to 
               strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook 
               over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say! Good show!

               Then he points his thumb at himself

                                     JONATHAN
                         And did I panic?

               He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I think not.

               And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan 
               dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

               NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the 
               water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she 
               wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.

               Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the 
               far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

                                     BENI
                         Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I 
                         got all the horses!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on 
                         the wrong side of the river!

               Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand 
               CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...

               BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY

               O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading 
               post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them 
               the reins of four ugly old camels.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't believe the price of these 
                         fleabags.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We coulda had 'em for free, all we 
                         had to do was give 'em your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Awfully.

               And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's 
               changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then again...

               SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in 
               the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. 
                         They smell, they bite, they spit. 
                         Disgusting.

               The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile 
               green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his 
               gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, disgusting.

               Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I think they're cute.

               WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the 
               desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.

               FRYING PAN - NIGHT

               The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking 
               across the vast wasteland.

               Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the 
               rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden 
               SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to 
               slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, 
               then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking 
               her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he 
               looks up at a distant ridge --

               -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing 
               them.

               EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY

               The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as 
               Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And you snore!

                                     WARDEN
                         I do not snore!

                                     JONATHAN
                         All night you snored!

                                     WARDEN
                         I have never snored!

               Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're almost there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Are you sure?

               O'Connell looks down at the ground.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure.

               The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking 
               out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the 
               skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the 
               desert floor.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What in bloody hell is this?

               The Warden shivers in fear.

                                     WARDEN
                         Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

               The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
               the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE 
               DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel, 
               the rest ride horses.

                                     BENI
                         Good morning, my friend!

               O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred 
               feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless 
               horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

                                     DANIELS
                         Well, what the hell we doin'?

                                     BENI
                         Patience, my good sahib, patience.

               Henderson looks over at O'Connell.

                                     HENDERSON
                         First one to the city, O'Connell! 
                         Five hundred! Cash bucks!

               O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.

               Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts 
               to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get ready.

               Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.

                                     EVELYN
                         For what?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're about to be shown the way.

               Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the 
               sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.

               Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --

                                     DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS
                         HEYA!

               The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.

                                     DANIELS
                         SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!

               Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't 
                         we be going?

                                     EVELYN
                         After all, you rode us night and day 
                         to win that bet.

               O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the 
               Americans and spits into the sand.

                                     BENI
                         Fools.

               And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.

               Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.

               The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
               way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.

               The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.

               The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
               volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell 
               and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And 
               the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from 
               his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it 
               to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

               The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.

               The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.

               And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.

               And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else 
               hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.

               And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.

               Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. 
               Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!

               But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni 
               off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.

               Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never 
               felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this 
               girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of 
               the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
               him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn! Slow down!

               Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S 
                         A REALLY BIG --

               INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands 
               in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

               O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Never mind.

               The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
               the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy 
               hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three 
               Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats 
               flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty 
               backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.

                                     DANIELS
                         Where'd all these camels come from?

                                     BENI
                         They belong to the dead. They will 
                         wait years for their masters to return 
                         before leaving.

               EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next 
               to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

               O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
               the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan 
               bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS 
               and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That thing gives me the creeps.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Be nice. That thing saved my life.

               Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.

                                     EVELYN
                         That "thing" gets me excited.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         The things that get you excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to Bembridge Scholars, 
                         inside the statue of Anubis was a 
                         secret compartment, perhaps containing 
                         The Book Of The Living.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are those mirrors for?

                                     EVELYN
                         Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

               O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.

               INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden 
               drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you realize, we are standing inside 
                         a room that no one has entered in 
                         over four thousand years.

                                     WARDEN
                         Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're welcome to my share of the 
                         spider webs.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And it stinks to high heaven in here.

               Evelyn just rolls her eyes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Cretins.

               Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops 
               sniffing.

               Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, 
               then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF 
               LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT 
               HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE 
               DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT 
               RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's 
               chamber.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That is a neat trick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Preparation for what?

                                     EVELYN
                         For entering the afterlife.

               O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Mummies, my good son, this is where 
                         they made the mummies.

               Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way 
               through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat 
               warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and 
               freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.

               They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker 
               and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and 
               louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan 
               licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

               ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
               an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.

               Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the 
               other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn 
               behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

               O'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT 
               HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because 
               it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Likewise.

               But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.

                                     DANIELS
                         This here is our statue,... friend.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't see your name on it,... pal.

               And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step 
               out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are 
                         no-so-good.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've had worse.

               Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, me too.

               O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun, 
               grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then 
               Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

                                     EVELYN
                         Let's be nice, children, if we're 
                         going to play together, we must learn 
                         to share.

               Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.

               Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing.

               The Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the 
               ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my calculations, we 
                         should be right under the statue. 
                         We'll come up right between his legs.
                              (she blushes and laughs)
                         Oh my.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And when those dirty Yanks go to 
                         sleep --
                              (looks at O'Connell)
                         No offense.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None taken.

                                     JONATHAN
                         We'll sneak up and steal that book 
                         right out from under them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And you're sure you can find the 
                         secret compartment?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't 
                         already found it.

               Jonathan looks around.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what's our smelly little friend 
                         got himself up to?

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.

               A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's 
               found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         Seti was no fool.

               Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, sure...

               He looks back at the native Diggers.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We'll let him open it.

               The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.

               The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out 
               his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless.

               Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back 
               away as well.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme get this straight, they stuck 
                         a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, 
                         cut your brain into small pieces, 
                         then ripped it all out through your 
                         nostrils?

                                     JONATHAN
                         OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

                                     EVELYN
                         It's called mummification. You're 
                         dead when they do this

                                     JONATHAN
                         Still...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two are worse than a couple of 
                         schoolboys.

               And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.

               O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES 
               for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE 
               CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER

               Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their 
               guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, 
               he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         FENI!

               The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, 
               The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The 
               compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers 
               give one final pull and --

               -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS 
               THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

               Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the 
               ground...

               The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

               We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks 
                         like a sarcophagus.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why would they bury somebody in the 
                         ceiling?

                                     EVELYN
                         They didn't, they buried him at the 
                         foot of Anubis. He was either someone 
                         of great importance. Or he did 
                         something very naughty.

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then 
               greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops 
               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

               CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.

               The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to 
               WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

               Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE 
               scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

               The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS 
               IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The 
               Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The 
               lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and 
               COUGHING.

               And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, 
               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it 
               Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well?... Who is it?

               Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

                                     EVELYN
                         'He that shall not be named.'

               O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's some sort of lock here. You 
                         say these thing's are made of granite 
                         with a steel interior?

                                     EVELYN
                         Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting 
                         out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No kiddin', without a key, it'll 
                         take us a month to crack this thing,

                                     EVELYN
                         A key! That's it! That's what he was 
                         talking about.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who was talking about what?

               Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

                                     EVELYN
                         The man on the barge. The one with 
                         the hook, he was looking for a key.

               Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine!

               Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's 
               now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.

               And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through 
               the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden 
               starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, 
               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The 
               Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, 
               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

                                     EVELYN
                         What do you suppose killed him?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you ever see him eat?

               O'Connell comes up over some rocks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Seems the Americans had a little 
                         misadventure of their own today, 
                         three of their diggers were killed.

                                     EVELYN
                         How?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. 
                         Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Maybe this place really is cursed.

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.

               The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous 
               look. Evelyn laughs.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't believe in curses, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I believe if I can see it and I 
                         can touch it, then it's real. That's 
                         what I believe.

               O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I believe in being prepared.

               Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the 
               scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY 
               PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --
               Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the 
               pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN
                         WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!

               Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch 
               and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Seagrams!

               Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside 
               out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well, he may have been a stinky 
                         fellow,... but he had good taste.

               Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily 
               And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then 
               a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.

               O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Stay here!

               He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately 
               gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the 
               bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man 
                         just say -- !

               EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

               The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS 
               gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as 
               they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill 
               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps 
               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.

               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, 
               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Goin' somewhere?

                                     BENI
                         Just looking for you, O'Connell! I 
                         wanted to be with my friend!

               O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, friend.

                                     BENI
                              (struggling)
                         Why do you like to fight so much?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         'Cause I look good doin, it.

               Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down 
               with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, 
               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to 
               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point 
               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell 
               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, 
               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider 
               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.

               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, 
               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly 
               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises 
               his scimitar, about to strike.

               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant 
               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS 
               him twenty feet back into some ruins.

               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and 
               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand 
               dune.

               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the 
               temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.

               Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let 'em have it, boys!

               Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, 
               the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, bloody good show.

               And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land 
               behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around 
               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.

               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something 
               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray 
               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises 
               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!

               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, 
               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It 
               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two 
               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray 
               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE 
                         OR DIE!

               Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after 
               him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, 
               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn 
               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her 
               and holds her close.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You alright?

               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time 
               he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's 
               also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes,... fine,... thank you.

               Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and 
               Burns help Daniels to his feet.

                                     DANIELS
                         See! That proves it! Old Seti's 
                         fortune's gotta be under this sand!

                                     HENDERSON
                         For them to protect it like this, 
                         you just know there's got to be 
                         treasure down there.

               O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These men are a desert people. They 
                         value water, not gold.

               Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where's Jonathan?

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.

               Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.

               O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, 
               the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the 
               bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

                                     EVELYN
                         Unlike my brother, sir, I know when 
                         to say no.

               O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Unlike your brother, Miss, you I 
                         don't get. You're a whole new brew.

                                     EVELYN
                         I know, you're wondering, what's a 
                         place like me doing in a girl like 
                         this?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Something like that.

                                     EVELYN
                         Egypt is in my blood. My father was 
                         a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so 
                         much that he married an Egyptian. My 
                         mother! Who was quite an adventurer 
                         herself

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, I get your father, I get your 
                         mother and I get your brother, but 
                         what are you doing here?

               Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

                                     EVELYN
                         I may not be an explorer, or an 
                         adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or 
                         a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But 
                         I'm proud of what I am.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And what is that?

               Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins 
               and proudly lifts her head high.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...I am a librarian!

               She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm going to kiss you, Mister 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No you're not.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm not?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not unless you call me Rick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Why would I do that?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's my name.

               She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES 
               HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, 
               slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and 
               just smiles.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and 
               turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are 
               heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

               They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

               PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

                                     EVELYN
                         I can't believe I allowed the two of 
                         you to get me drunk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Don't blame me, I don't even remember 
                         being there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well neither do I, thank you.

               O'Connell gives her a hurt look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't?

               Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

                                     EVELYN
                         No... Why?... Should I?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Gee, yeah, you told me it was the 
                         best time you ever had.

               O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, 
               appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF 
               and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly 
               grab their sore heads and MOAN.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the 
               secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.

               Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out 
               the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.

               Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         There is a curse upon this chest.

                                     DANIELS
                         Curse my ass.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, who cares.

               The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         In these hallowed grounds, that which 
                         was set forth in ancient times, is 
                         as strong today, as it was then.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

               The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         "Death will come on swift wings to 
                         whomever opens this chest".

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER 
               All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.

               The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         It says, there is one, the undead, 
                         who if brought back to life, is bound 
                         by sacred law to consummate this 
                         curse.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, well, let's just make sure we 
                         don't bring anybody back from the 
                         dead then, huh?

               The three Americans laugh.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         He will kill all who open this 
                         chest,... and assimilate their organs 
                         and fluids.

                                     DANIELS
                         Assimilate their organs and fluids? 
                         Ya mean eat 'em?

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         And in so doing he will regenerate. 
                         And no longer be the undead, but a 
                         plague upon this earth.

               The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and 
               the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just 
               shrugs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next 
               to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, I've dreamed about this 
                         ever since I was a little girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You dream about dead guys?

               Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and 
               cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Look, all the sacred spells have 
                         been chiseled off. The hieratics and 
                         hieroglyphs that protect the deceased 
                         on his journey into the afterlife, 
                         they've been removed. This man was 
                         cursed,... doomed.

               O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Tough break.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see 
                         who's inside, shall we?

               Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box 
               into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a 
               HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs

               the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan 
               helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.

               And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT 
               INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN
                         AHHHHH!!!

               They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 
               'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years 
               have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
               chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background, 
               Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

                                     BENI
                         The curse,... beware the curse!

               Beni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.

                                     DANIELS
                         Stupid superstitious bastard.

               And that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT 
               OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and 
               carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Is he supposed to look like that?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I've never seen a mummy look 
                         like this. He's, he's still...

                                     JONATHAN
                         Juicy?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. He's more than four thousand 
                         years old and still decomposing.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And look at this.

               O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there 
               are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, he was buried alive.

               This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         And he left a message.

               WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

                                     EVELYN
                         It says: 'Death is only the 
                         beginning.'

               Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's my gun?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What are you going to do? Shoot him?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed 
               at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches 
               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book 
               Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to 
               life.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         I have heard told of this book, but 
                         I never truly believed it existed. 
                         This, good gentlemen, is a most 
                         priceless treasure.

               Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.

                                     HENDERSON
                         I wouldn't trade ya for a brass 
                         spittoon!

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta 
                         pure gold!

               Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal 
               a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL 
               ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni 
               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan 
               wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What is this stuff? It smells like 
                         our late friend, the Warden.

               O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You did not!?... We're not!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Rat gizzards. They smell bad and 
                         taste worse, but that's the best the 
                         desert has to offer.

               The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Say O'Connell, whadaya think these 
                         honey's'll fetch back home?

                                     BURNS
                         We hear you gentlemen found yerselves 
                         a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

                                     DANIELS
                         Ya know if ya dry him out, you can 
                         sell him for firewood.

               The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a 
               pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.

                                     EVELYN
                         Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them 
                         inside our friend's coffin. They can 
                         stay alive for years living off the 
                         flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

               She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

                                     EVELYN
                         Famished.

               O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are you saying somebody threw these 
                         things in with our guy, and they 
                         slowly ate him alive?

                                     EVELYN
                         Very slowly.

                                     JONATHAN
                         He certainly was not a popular fellow 
                         when they planted him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Must of got a little too frisky with 
                         the Pharaoh's daughter.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my readings, our friend 
                         suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of 
                         all ancient Egyptian curses, one 
                         reserved for only the most evil 
                         blasphemers. In all of my research, 
                         I've never read of this curse actually 
                         having been performed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That bad huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, they never used it because they 
                         feared it so. It's written, that if 
                         a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever 
                         arise, he would bring with him the 
                         ten plagues of Egypt.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The ten plagues?... You mean all ten 
                         plagues.

                                     BENI
                         Like what that Moses guy did to that 
                         Pharaoh guy?

                                     EVELYN
                         That's one way of putting it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let's see, there was frogs, flies, 
                         locusts...

                                     BURNS
                         Hail and fire.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The sun turning black.

                                     DANIELS
                         Water turning to blood.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And my personal favorite: people 
                         covered in boils and sores.

               All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just 
               laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

                                     EVELYN
                         Fried gizzard anyone?

               EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple 
               and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the 
               Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, 
               the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn 
               stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks 
               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

               Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over 
               and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You sure you outta be playin, around 
                         with that?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's just a book, no harm ever came 
                         from a book.

               Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell 
               share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

               Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's 
               chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN 
               over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards 
               Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills 
               FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!

               Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, 
               sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!

               He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, 
               coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all 
               leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.

               The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the 
               darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops 
               everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their 
               side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid 
               vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

               The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The 
               Book Of The Dead, looking haunted.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         What have we done?

               The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, 
               slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! 
                         Billions of grasshoppers!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's one of the plagues, right? 
                         The grasshopper plague!

                                     EVELYN
                         This is not a plague. It's 
                         generational. Every so many years 
                         the locusts of Egypt have a population 
                         explosion and they all take flight.

               Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers 
               his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... and what about frogs?

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.

               Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, 
               they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet, 
               squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels! Henderson!

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to 
               SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF 
               CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start 
               scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.

               Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul 
               ass.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out 
               in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything.

               Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps 
               out.

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels?... is that you?

               Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

                                     BURNS
                         Henderson?

               Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands 
               reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns 
               jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at 
               them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts 
               to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just 
               ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

               O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next 
               to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of 
               the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs 
               scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send 
               shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.

               Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then 
               they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!?

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully 
               looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels 
               her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft 
               of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A 
               MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards 
               him.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh thank goodness, you're one of the 
                         Americans, aren't you?

               Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF 
               HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, 
               she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around 
               It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is 
               down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, 
               her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun?

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! Must be a trap door around 
                         here or somethin'.

               And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, 
               Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!

               O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of 
               CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly 
               trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and 
               help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as 
               the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through 
               him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels 
               Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already 
               running, races right past them. The others turn and haul 
               ass.

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to 
               MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal 
               legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

                                     EVELYN
                         Help me,... please,... help me.

               Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because 
               HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the 
               ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a 
               big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his 
               fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

               Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying 
               around the corner and runs right up to her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Would you quit playin, around! Let's 
                         get outta here already!

               O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at 
               the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         WHOA!

               O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.

               Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering 
               his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts 
               to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops 
               and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches 
               to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial 
               SHRIEK.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his 
               fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Ahhhhhhhh!!

               Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the 
               SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his 
               ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn 
               stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN 
               ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson, 
               Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees, 
               hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I told you to leave or die, you 
                         refused, and now you may have killed 
                         us all. For you have unleashed the 
                         creature that we have feared for 
                         more than four thousand years.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax, I got him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         No mortal weapons can kill this 
                         creature. He is not of this world.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are we talkin, about the same 
                         creature? The walking corpse? Really 
                         big mouth? Really bad breath?

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He 
               turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs 
               away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but 
               have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the 
               back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.

               Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten 
               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his 
               side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his 
               neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.

               Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly 
               makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

                                     BENI
                         May the good Lord protect and watch 
                         over me as a shepherd watches over 
                         his flock. And may Satan in all his 
                         forms be vanquished forever.

               It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni 
               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them 
               out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his 
               progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a 
               Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.

               All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and 
               Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for 
               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.

               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses 
               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand 
               lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (subtitled)
                         The language of the slaves.

               Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (in Hebrew -- subtitled)
                         I may have use for you. And the 
                         rewards will be great.

               Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out 
               his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes, 
               about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a 
               tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises 
               his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Where are the other sacred jars?

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant 
               sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.

                                     DANIELS
                         You bastards!

                                     HENDERSON
                         What did you do to him!?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We saved him! Saved him before the 
                         creature could finish his work. Now 
                         leave, all of you, quickly, before 
                         he finishes you all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You're not going to kill us?

               Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We must now hunt him down, and try 
                         and find a way to kill him, before 
                         he consumes the earth. Allah be with 
                         us.

               Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.

               O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I told ya, I already got him!

               Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Know this, the creature will be coming 
                         for you. He must consummate the curse. 
                         And until he does, he will never 
                         eat, he will never sleep, and he 
                         will never stop.

               Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,

               EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels 
               and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist, 
               still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.

               They all head off into the dark, windblown desert...

               And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY 
               PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC, 
               PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE --

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY

               A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front 
               gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty 
               camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.

               INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY

               A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.

               O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I thought you didn't believe in this 
                         stuff!?

               O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses

                                     EVELYN
                         Having an encounter with a four 
                         thousand year old walking-talking 
                         corpse tends to convert one.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Forget it, we're out the door down 
                         the hall and gone.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, we are not.

               O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yes we are.

               O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues 
               to UNPACK them:

                                     EVELYN
                         No we are not. We woke him up, and 
                         we must try and stop him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We?! What we?! You didn't read that 
                         book. I told you not to play around 
                         with that thing.

                                     EVELYN
                         Alright then, Me, I,... I read the 
                         book, I woke him up and I intend to 
                         stop him.

               O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How!? You heard the man, no mortal 
                         weapons can kill this guy.

               Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Then we'll have to find some immortal 
                         ones.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There goes that belief again. Not 
                         me, I am outta here!

               O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

               Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

               O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking 
               his fingers as Evelyn follows him.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to that Book, once this 
                         creature has been reborn, his curse 
                         will spread, and as he grows in 
                         strength, so will his curse grow, 
                         infecting the people until the whole 
                         of the earth is destroyed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

                                     EVELYN
                              (incredulous)
                         It's everybody's problem!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Look lady, I appreciate you saving 
                         my life and all, but when I signed 
                         on, I agreed to take you out there 
                         and bring you back, and I did, now 
                         were even, end of job, end of story, 
                         contract terminated.

                                     EVELYN
                         That's what I am to you? A contract?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You can either tag along with me, or 
                         you can stay here and play around 
                         with Mister Maggot.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm staying.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FINE.

               O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the 
               door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a 
               handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni 
               coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his 
               face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Beni ya little stinkweed, where did 
                         you slink off to?

                                     BENI
                         You left me! You left me in the desert 
                         to rot.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
                              (gestures to Imhotep)
                         So who's this guy?

                                     BENI
                         This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest 
                         of Osiris.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

               O'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils 
               O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.

                                     BENI
                         The Prince does not like to be touched 
                         by other humans. A Silly eastern 
                         superstition, I'm afraid.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, well, we all got our little 
                         problems today don't we?

                                     BENI
                         He has come to help Mister Burns. 
                         Somehow I feel responsible.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't gimme that, you never had any 
                         scruples.

                                     BENI
                         Do you know where I can steal some?

               O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives 
               Imhotep a look as he strides off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         See ya around, Padre.

               Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and 
               hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a 
               walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.

               He wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm the last of the Royal Force still 
                         stationed here, you know? All the 
                         other laddies died in the air and 
                         were buried in the sand.

               The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to 
               O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

                                     WINSTON
                         Ever since the end of the Great War, 
                         there hasn't been a single challenge 
                         worthy of a man like me.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've heard it before, Winston.

               O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I just wish I would've chucked it 
                         with the other laddies, gone down in 
                         a flame of glory, instead of sitting 
                         around here, rotting from boredom 
                         and booze!

               Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods 
               Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

               Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment.

                                     BURNS
                         The drawer there, spectacles.
                              (tries to laugh)
                         As you see, I won't be needing them.

               Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He 
               puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins 
               broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

                                     BENI
                         Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks 
                         you for your spectacles, -- and for 
                         your eyes,... and for your tongue.

               The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

                                     BENI
                         But I am afraid more is needed, the 
                         Prince says he must finish the job, 
                         consummate the curse which you and 
                         your friends have brought down upon 
                         yourselves.

               A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly 
               backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the 
               sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing 
               his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and 
               Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly SPIT 
               OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,... 
                         like...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Blood.

               They all look at each other, even more nervous.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "And the rivers and waters of Egypt 
                         went red and were as blood."

               A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here.

               He suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Who's here!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound, 
               knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY

               Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
               books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops 
               half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and 
               drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We got problems.

               And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the 
               courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain 
               bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and 
               CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here! I saw him! That thing is 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         The creature!? Are you sure!?

               O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the 
               HAIL and FIRE.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure!

               The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.

               O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM 
               is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

               O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

               INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

               O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant 
               who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they 
               spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- 
               HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE.

               Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are 
               shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep 
               standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his 
               gun.

               Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful 
               new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and 
               REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and 
               CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks 
               like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell.

               The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We are in serious trouble.

               Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Back off, creep.

               Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep 
               Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

               Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're 
               all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

               O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep 
               in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND 
               GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, 
               shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of 
               Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist 
               quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as 
               if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

               Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, 
               THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others 
               knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that 
               just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.

               He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, 
               terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         You saved me from the undead. For 
                         this, I shall make you immortal.

               He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

               And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins 
               into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.

               Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The curse. The curse.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn 
               across the Ramesseum.

                                     EVELYN
                         There's only one person I know who 
                         can possibly give us some answers.

               They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is 
               talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         YOU!

               O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth 
               Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

                                     CURATOR
                         Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

                                     EVELYN
                         What is he doing here?

                                     CURATOR
                         Do you truly wish to know? Or would 
                         you prefer to just shoot us?

               Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just saw my fist vanish into some 
                         guy's head.

               He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm willin, to go on a little faith, 
                         here.

                                     CURATOR
                         You will not believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Try me.

               INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

               Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The 
               First.

               We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits on Seti's 
               throne.

                                     CURATOR
                         We are part of an ancient secret 
                         society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and 
                         we have a sacred mission, passed 
                         down through thirty-nine generations. 
                         For over four thousand years we have 
                         guarded The City Of The Dead. we are 
                         sworn at manhood to do any and all 
                         in our power to stop the High Priest 
                         Imhotep from being reborn into this 
                         world.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And because of you, we have failed.

                                     EVELYN
                              (appalled)
                         And you think this justifies killing 
                         innocent people!?

                                     CURATOR
                         To have stopped this creature? Yes!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's 
                         afraid of cats, what's that about?

                                     CURATOR
                         According to the ancients, cat's are 
                         the guardians at the gates of the 
                         underworld. Imhotep will fear them 
                         until he is fully regenerated, and 
                         then he will fear nothing.

               Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.

                                     DANIELS
                         Right! And ya know how he gets fully 
                         regenerated?! By killing everybody 
                         who opened that chest and sucking us 
                         dry! That's how!

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes, the creature must first try and 
                         regenerate, and then he will attempt 
                         to resurrect the one he has loved 
                         for more than four thousand years.

                                     EVELYN
                         Anck-su-namun.

               The Curator and Ardeth Ray look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.

                                     EVELYN
                         In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
                         alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
                         su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' 
                         quarters he tried to kiss me.

                                     CURATOR
                         It is because it was you who read 
                         from the Book. He has chosen you to 
                         be the human sacrifice needed to 
                         regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

               Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

                                     JONATHAN
                         This is not good. Not good at all.

               Ardeth Ray has been staring out a wall of windows.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Tonight is the full moon. The moon 
                         of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

               Everyone follows Ardeth Ray's eyes, through the windows we 
               can see the SUN, -- which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "...and he stretched forth his hands 
                         towards the heavens, and there was 
                         darkness throughout the land of 
                         Egypt."

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning 
               the walls. Above and beyond them, -- is the BLACK SUN.

               EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer

                                     EVELYN
                         We must stop him from regenerating.

               She turns to Daniels and Henderson.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who opened that chest?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Well, there was me and Daniels here 
                         and then poor Burns of course, oh 
                         yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

               O'Connell turns from the window.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What about my buddy, Beni?

                                     DANIELS
                         Naw, he scrammed outta there,

                                     EVELYN
                         We must find the Egyptologist and 
                         bring him back here to the safety of 
                         the fort, before the creature can 
                         get to him.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you 
                         two come with me.

               All three of them pounce on him at once --

                                     HENDERSON
                         The hell with that! I'm not goin' 
                         nowhere! We're safe here.

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for 
                         nothin'.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who put you in charge? You can't 
                         just leave me behind like some old 
                         suitcase. I'm the one responsible 
                         for this mess and I intend to be the 
                         one to clean it up.

               O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.

               Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the 
               door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room 
               we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

               O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Keep an eye on her. If you leave her 
                         door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon, 
                         Jonathan.

               Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Me?

               CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking 
               haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and 
               his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking 
               him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed 
               face.

               He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers 
               his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading 
               into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO --

               THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files 
               and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket 
               watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he 
               starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Well, well, well.

               Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

               Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a 
               chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into 
               a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up 
               the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's your new friend?

                                     BENI
                         What friend? You're my only friend.

               O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then you got no excuse for living. 
                         What the hell you doin, being buddies 
                         with this creep, Beni? What's in it 
                         for you?

                                     BENI
                         It is better to be the right hand of 
                         the Devil,... than in his path. As 
                         long as I serve him, I am immune.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Immune from what?

                                     BENI
                         You shall see.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are you looking for? Lie, and 
                         I'll slit your throat.

               O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.

                                     BENI
                         The book! The black book they found 
                         at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. 
                         Said to me it would be worth it's 
                         weight in diamonds.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What does he want the book for?

                                     BENI
                              (shrugs)
                         Something about bringing his dead 
                         girly-friend back to life. He needs 
                         the book...
                              (looks at Jonathan)
                         And your sister.

               O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES 
               O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.

               Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That looked rather painful.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (wincing)
                         Ya know, ever since I met you, my 
                         luck has been for crap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I know, I do that to people.

               And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming 
               from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to 
               the window and look out --

               EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing 
               away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

               A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's 
               Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and 
               catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; 
               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a 
               huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.

               The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

               EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! That's two down and only 
                         two to go.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And then he'll be coming after Evy.

               They turn and race out of the office.

               BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT

               Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at 
               the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Ten o'clock! All is well!

               The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below

               INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT

               Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair 
               next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with 
               fear.

                                     DANIELS
                         The hell with this. I'm goin, 
                         downstairs to get me a drink. You 
                         want somethin'?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a 
                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

               Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, 
               smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his 
               SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes 
               in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson 
               gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

               The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS 
               Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

               Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.

               His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is 
               SUCKED out of him.

               Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the 
               SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a 
               human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.

               And then it's over.

               Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and 
               looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps 
               over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, 
               rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in 
               through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large 
               mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO 
               THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is 
               Imhotep.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
               stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.

               O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, 
               still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she 
               sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.

               Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth 
               instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the 
               bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's 
               rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.

               Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get your hands off my girl, pal.

               Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
               O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Nice lips.

               Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I figured you might be here, so I 
                         brought a friend.

               He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively 
               catches it.

               He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the 
               window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a 
               dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.

               Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES 
               out the window and vanishes over the compound.

               Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.

               O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

               Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the 
               floor... and drops the martini glasses.

               INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT

               Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, 
               HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell, 
               looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You called me your girl?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, 
                         you know, figure a speech.

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you were jealous

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see 
                         that guy's face?

               Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

                                     DANIELS
                         Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do 
                         somethin'! we gotta do somethin, 
                         NOW! Before it's too late!

               They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

               EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

               A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling 
               with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins 
               to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people 
               begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness -- it's already too late.

               Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted 
               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his 
               side, looking very nervous.

               And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow 
               Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS 
               AND SORES.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

               O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray 
               follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.

                                     EVELYN
                         Last month I came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned The Book 
                         Of The Dead.

                                     DANIELS
                         That book we found at Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead. A notion I was unwilling to 
                         believe.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Believe it, sister. That's what 
                         brought our buddy back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And now he's going to use it to bring 
                         his girlfriend back

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And if he succeeds, the two of them 
                         together will bring about the 
                         apocalypse.

               The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
               stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         The plagues we have seen so far, are 
                         merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. 
                         Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's 
                         resurrection will he be truly 
                         invincible.

               They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm thinking that if the black Book 
                         Of The Dead can bring people back to 
                         life --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of 
                         The Living can return them to the 
                         underworld.

                                     EVELYN
                         Exactly --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So your sayin', if we find the book 
                         made outta gold --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- And read the sacred incantations 
                         contained inside it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You think it'll send this guy back 
                         to hell?

                                     CURATOR
                         Correct, And that's when --

               LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush 
               over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large, 
               CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING 
               up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!'

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         It has begun. The beginning of the 
                         end.

                                     EVELYN
                         Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

               Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.

               EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

               The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are 
               locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while 
               CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

               The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the 
               Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.

               The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.

                                     EVELYN
                         Got it!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got what?

               The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn 
               talks while quickly translating the tablet:

                                     EVELYN
                         Since the black Book of The Dead was 
                         found inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         then according to this, the golden 
                         Book of The Living should be inside...

               Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What?

                                     DANIELS
                         WHAT!?

                                     EVELYN
                         The golden Book Of The Living, is 
                         inside the statue of Horus.

                                     CURATOR
                         Which would be located not far to 
                         the east of the Anubis statue.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't tell me we gotta go back out 
                         there?

                                     CURATOR
                         If we want to kill the creature, 
                         yes.

               TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway, 
               SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them 
               over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into 
               the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN, 
               The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass 
               across the balcony and down the staircase.

               EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT

               Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
               convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob 
               comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs 
               his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

               The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
               of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it 
               up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump 
               inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

                                     BENI
                         Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

               Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
               windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points 
               a finger at Beni as they race past him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're gonna get yours, pal!

               Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
               size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.

               His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out 
               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.

               EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT

               The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

               Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the 
               car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them 
               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, 
               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He 
               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a 
               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing 
               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! 
               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like 
               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them 
               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down 
               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He 
               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through 
               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased 
               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

               INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT

               The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE 
               DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to 
               O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.

               All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.

               Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the 
               windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses 
               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

               They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob 
               quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his 
               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into 
               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way 
               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth 
               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the 
               lit match near the fuse.

               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring 
               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, 
               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did 
               the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

                                     EVELYN
                         He's gorgeous.

               O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He 
               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it 
               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives 
               O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         He has consummated the curse, now 
                         all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun 
                         from the dead, then it will be the 
                         end of us, and the beginning for 
                         them.

               Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell 
               LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, 
               watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The 
               tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the 
               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward 
               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on 
               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Koontash dai na.

               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

                                     BENI
                         Take his hand and he will spare the 
                         others.

               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty 
               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, 
               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, 
               powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Any bright ideas?

               O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, fresh out.

               Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to 
               take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- 
               but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't do it, Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have no choice.

               Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes 
               around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

                                     BENI
                         Come with me my princess. It is time 
                         to make you mine, forever.

               Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --

                                     EVELYN
                         All eternity, idiot.

               Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

                                     EVELYN
                         You better think of something, because 
                         if he turns me into a mummy, you're 
                         the first one I'm coming after.

               O'Connell almost smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got guts, lady.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep 
                         them.

               Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- 
               RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine -- !

               Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.

               O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of 
               Ardeth Ray's grip.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!

               The huge, powerful man holds him tight.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Be calm. There is still time. We can 
                         stop him yet.

               The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep 
               stops and looks back at O'Connell.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Pared oos.

               Evelyn SCREAMS.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!!

               Beni smiles.

                                     BENI
                         Kill them.

               Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's 
               grip and stumbles forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         EVELYN!

               But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.

               O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE 
               COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after 
               him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.

                                     CURATOR
                         Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

               The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth 
               Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator 
               apart.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the 
               watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a 
               LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then 
               more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

               O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead 
               of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby 
               fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

               FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

               STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

               The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, 
               followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE...

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We gotta get her back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I'm with you, old man. No one touches 
                         my sister like that and gets away 
                         with it.

               O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You know where he's taking her?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the 
                         ritual.

               Jonathan looks worried.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And what ritual would that be?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
                         su-namun back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And how does one do that?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         By reading the Book Of The Dead.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes, of course.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And then killing your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me?

               Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Imhotep is now able to cross the 
                         desert with great haste.

               Jonathan taps him in the shoulder.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Begging your pardon, but I wasn't 
                         quite clear on that last part.

               Ardeth Ray ignores him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         If he arrives before us, it will be 
                         too late.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you say 'kill' my sister?

               O'Connell smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know how to beat him to it.

               And on that WE SMASH CUT TO -- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN 

               Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set 
               of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with 
               R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:

                               HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP

               EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston 
               Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's your little problem got to 
                         do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not a god-damned thing.

               Winston looks intrigued.

                                     WINSTON
                         Is it dangerous?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You probably won't live through it.

               This really interests him.

                                     WINSTON
                         By Jove, do you really think so?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Everybody else we've bumped into has 
                         died, why not you?

               Winston nods his head, he's hooked.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's the challenge then?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         To save the damsel in distress, kill 
                         the bad guy and steal his treasure.

               A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives 
               them a snappy salute.

                                     WINSTON
                         Winston Havlock at your service, 
                         sir!

               SAHARA - DAY

               Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the 
               dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to 
               dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it, 
               they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS 
               INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

               Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.

                                     EVELYN
                         What just happened?

                                     BENI
                         All I remember is him turning into a 
                         blast of sand,... and then I remember 
                         nothing.

               Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

               INT. BIPLANE - DAY

               The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in 
               the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle 
               across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right.

               Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

               EXT. SAHARA - DAY

               Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size, 
               he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And 
               a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

               BIPLANE - DAY

               O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise 
               up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees 
               what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the 
               plane into a dive.

                                     WINSTON
                         Hang on, men!

               WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting 
               biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.

               O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT 
               FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.

               O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and 
               FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the 
               sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw 
               unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.

               Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

                                     WINSTON
                         We're going down!

               The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. 
               Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston 
               Havlock LAUGHING.

                                     WINSTON
                         Here I come, laddies!

               O'Connell braces himself for impact,

               SAHARA - DAY

               Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         Stop it! You'll kill them!

               Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare 
               into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes 
               herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

               EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY

               The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-
               down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls 
               out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed 
               into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me... A little help would be 
                         useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH 
                         TROUBLE!!

               O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to 
               the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's 
               mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a 
               cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell 
               and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

               A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the 
               sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and 
               look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides 
               away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane 
               vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...

               HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the 
               volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, now what the hell does this 
                         Horus guy look like?

                                     JONATHAN
                         He's a big fellow with pointy ears 
                         and a face like a falcon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got it.

               HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY

               Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make 
               their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading 
               into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

               NECROPOLIS - DAY

               Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She 
               stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through 
               the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his 
               rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

                                     BENI
                         Keep moving.

               Evelyn gives him a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know, nasty little fellows such 
                         as yourself, always get their 
                         comeuppance.

               Beni suddenly looks worried.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah?

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh yes, always.

               Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on 
               his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the 
               disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed 
               doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, look at that.

               He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in 
               his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to 
               glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Say, gents! You should come have a 
                         look at this.

               The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the 
               scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into 
               Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

               O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The 
               scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips 
               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's 
               arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being 
               cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

               The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
               back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

               O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and 
               Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years 
               ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

               Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC 
               JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's 
               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

               Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

               TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking 
               mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

               They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         From now on, don't touch anything. 
                         Not a damn thing. Keep your hands 
                         off the furniture, got it?

               Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni 
               holds his gun on her, translating:

                                     BENI
                         Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

               Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but 
                         that it's already taken.

               Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel 
               encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

                                     BENI
                         He wants your heart and your brain, 
                         your liver, your kidneys...

               Evelyn's eyes widen.

                                     BENI
                         ...and how do you say? Those slimy 
                         things, in your stomach?

                                     EVELYN
                         Intestines.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah! Them.

               Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         You only want me for my organs?!

               Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP!

               Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, 
               malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.

               Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

               TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and 
               drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his 
               gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.

               O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting 
               through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a 
               wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his 
               gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning 
               the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT 
               OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM 
               FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.

               It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. 
               Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's 
               when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who the hell are these guys?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Priests. Imhotep's priests.

               O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I never killed a priest before.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         They are evil, cursed, they matter 
                         not.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Well, okay then.

               O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.

               BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

               O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips 
               through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, 
               blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

               The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the 
               loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh come on, gimme a break here.

               And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning 
               over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing 
               out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of 
               Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and 
               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage 
               from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (ancient Egyptian -- 
                              subtitled)
                         Kill them! Kill them all! And bring 
                         me the Book Of The Living!

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor 
               where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two 
               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More 
               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of 
               the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.

               O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         My turn.

               Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit 
               out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.

               O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING 
               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies 
               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

               Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at 
               all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels 
               and rolls about.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She 
               blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the 
               ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY

               The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into 
               the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a 
               passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This whole place is comin, alive!

               The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around 
               another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. 
               Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray 
               FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I'm out.

               He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --

               HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               -- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of 
               HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

                                     JONATHAN
                         There he is!

               They run up to the base of the statue,

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hello Horus old boy.

               O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the 
               passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a 
               stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Allow me.

               O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to 
               look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes 
               the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.

               Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the 
               passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.

               Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing 
               the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way 
               out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths 
               in the room.

               Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed 
               cheek.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth 
               Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These guys just don't quit.

               Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Keep digging!

               O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder 
               on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.

               The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

               Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...

               And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND 
               and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST 
               up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

               One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another 
               grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

               AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL 
               THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

               A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the 
               base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the 
               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

               He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD 
               Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder.

               The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Save the girl! Kill the creature!

               The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

               O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's the last one, we better get 
                         lucky.

               The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole 
               for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

               Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled 
               with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.

               Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.

               Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him 
               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the 
               door.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock 
               back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.

               Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling 
               hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and 
               into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.

               The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

               The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and 
               IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty 
               EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

               Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with 
               empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then 
               she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         With your death, my love and I will 
                         be invincible!

               He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and 
               Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

               Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I found it, Evy! I found it

                                     EVELYN
                         Shut-up and get me off of here!

               O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand, 
               jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.

               The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.

               Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial 
               knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests 
               stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

               EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:

                                     EVELYN
                         Open the book, Jonathan! Open the 
                         book! That's the only way to kill 
                         him!

               O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies, 
               fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly 
               SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles 
               with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't open it! It's locked or 
                         something!

               O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his 
               sword down at Evelyn, -- CLANG! One chain breaks free.

               Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along 
               the binder. It hits him like lightning --

                                     JONATHAN
                         We need the key!

               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain 
               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

                                     EVELYN
                         Read the inscription on the cover!

               O'Connell swings his sword down again, -- CLANG! Evelyn now 
               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell 
               force him back.

               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, 
               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.

               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching 
               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.

               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding 
               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.

               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES 
               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.

               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares 
               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh boy.

               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This just keeps gettin, better and 
                         better.

               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.

               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, 
               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, 
               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to 
               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her 
               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in 
               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for 
               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus 
               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

                                     JONATHAN
                         You have got to be joking?

               Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Finish the inscription, idiot!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh.

               Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best 
               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on 
               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now 
                         what is this last symbol here?

                                     EVELYN
                         What's it look like!?

               Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis 
               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's 
               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares 
               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

                                     JONATHAN
                         It's an Anck symbol, with two little 
                         squiggly lines above it, and a bird, 
                         a stork! on either side.

               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes,... I see.

               The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hootash im Ahmenophus!

               The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks 
               and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell 
               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, 
               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to 
               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily 
               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly 
               backpedals on his hands and heels.

               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for 
               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden 
               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.

               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!

               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still 
               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and 
               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay pal, let's see how tough you 
                         are without your right arm.

               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him 
               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a 
               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes 
               it off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Alright,... so he's left handed.

               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up 
               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I got it!

               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten 
               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep 
               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.

               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.

               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS 
               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,

               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage 
               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS 
               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in 
               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with 
               him.

               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.

               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed 
               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn 
               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working 
               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, 
               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES 
               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and 
               casually flings it away.

               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan 
               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
               looking for something.

               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat 
               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed 
               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, 
               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About 
               to die.

               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

                                     EVELYN
                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! 
                         PARED OOS!!

               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror 
               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which 
               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out 
               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The 
               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits 
               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.

               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, 
               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of 
               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden 
               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like 
               he's about to cry.

               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's 
               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the 
               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One 
               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep 
               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, 
               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword 
               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across 
               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the 
               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
               bog. The sword still in his stomach.

               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as 
               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And 
               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at 
               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               Evelyn translates:

                                     EVELYN
                         Death is only the beginning.

               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.

               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight 
               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, 
               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag 
               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF 
               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.

               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons 
               of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.

               CEMETERY - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls 
               start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon!

               He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
               pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower 
               and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick 
               the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure 
               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the 
               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again 
               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of 
               the sinking walls is deafening.

               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn 
               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a 
               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already 
               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet 
               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.

               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, 
               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of 
               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --

                                     BENI
                         O'CONNELL!!

               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand 
               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.

               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks 
               around with his diminishing torch.

               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's 
               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over 
               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.

               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

                                     BENI
                         Go away.

               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.

               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.

               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a 
               pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE 
               DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the 
               front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

               They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind 
               them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the 
               wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels 
               race out into the desert...

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PLATEAU - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the 
               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the 
               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well,... I guess we go home empty 
                         handed.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Wouldn't say that.

               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms 
               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.

               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel.

               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, 
               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs 
               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her 
               arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

                                     O'CONNELL/JONATHAN
                         TUK-TUK-TUK!!

               The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag 
               behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can 
               see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.

                                         THE END

THE MYSTERY MEN

Based on the Dark Horse comic created by Bob Burden

Revised June 6, 1997



THEME AND CREDITS...

FADE IN:

EXT.  ERIE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING 
INTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by 
towers and gun turrets.  Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from 
within...

CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" 
... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

THE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as 
CASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them.  Dressed in an 
immaculately tailored prison smock (with "Casanova" exquisitely 
embroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET 
BIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.

					BIERCE
		No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. 
		Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years 
		he has been with us, I have never seen a 
		patient turn his energies to more productive 
		use.

CASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.

					BIERCE
		Just look at his accomplishments... three 
		volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture 
		garden, four romance novels... and who can 
		forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow 
		in our all-psychotic production of 
		"Carousel"...

ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that 
brilliant performance...

					BIERCE
		Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.

ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top 
shrink.

A moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming, 
sincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion.  He is a master of 
seduction.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago I was a lost soul.  
		Loveless...
		(with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce)
		Fatherless...
		(chokes on the word)
		A... psycho!
		(breaks down sobbing)
		Oh!  How could I have done it? The murder... 
		the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls!
		(weeping, a brilliant performance)
		I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!

Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.  Reactions from the board, 
moved, as Casanova weeps convulsively.  Doctor Leek shows no reaction.

					CASANOVA
				(pulls himself together)
		But my deeds have been done, and my youth is 
		gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel 
		world... and if I have learned anything from my 
		wretched life it is that... When you walk 
		through a storm, keep your head held high...
					(singing)
		And don't be afraid of the dark...

Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY 
ORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF "WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM" SWELL...

SERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES

A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"... Casanova shakes hands and 
embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a 
paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.

In his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit 
(that's been waiting far him for twenty years).

Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the 
lock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the 
hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an 
office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board 
stand watching, very proud...

But suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari 
drives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the 
review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a 
nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...

Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up 
at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck... 
Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get 
in the car.

INT.   THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Casanova and Anabel drive off.  The massive old hospital is seen 
through the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his 
watch...

CLOSE ON HIS WATCH -

as the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  It is exactly twelve 
noon...

BACK ON CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
				(almost wistfully)
		Boom.

And the hospital EXPLODES in a HUGE FIREBALL that completely consumes 
it.

					CASANOVA
		Those gas leaks can be murder.

EXT.  THE ROAD - DAY

The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads 
"We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing". The city itself, a 
crumbling rust belt metropolis (ala Detroit) can be seen stretched out 
along the shore of Lake Champion off in the distance...

INSIDE THE CAR - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
		I'm home.

BACK ON THE ROAD  - CONTINUOUS

The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the 
road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed 
classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.  The caption reads 
"Crime.  Don't even think about it."

EXT.  TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

Letters read "Six months later"...

as the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, 
CRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars...

CAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then 
pulls up beside an old boxcar.  The back of the van is thrown open, a 
ramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time 
thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading 
their night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down 
the ramp.

					RED EYE 1
		Golf anyone?

Several more Red Eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes 
still attached, a barber pole, a Virgin Mary lawn statue, and a top of 
the line baby stroller... while their leader, BIG RED, stands in the 
door to the boxcar, watching approvingly.

					RED EYE 2
		Not a bad night's work.

					BIG RED
		Who said crime don't pay?

The Red Eyes laugh... as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby 
stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.

					RED EYE 3
		Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway.

The crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs 
at them.

					RED EYE 4
				(about to slug him)
		Who you laughin' at, punk?

					RED EYE 2
		He's just a tyke.  Lighten up.

					RED EYE 5
		He's kinda cute.

					RED EYE 3
		If you like drool.

					RED EYE 2
		Hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents?  
		For a million bucks!

The others think that's a great idea, but Big Red doesn't.

					BIG RED
		And what if he rats on us?

The others hadn't thought of that.

					RED EYE 3
		So what should we do with him?

					BIG RED
		Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in 
		the lake.

The others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.

					RED EYE 3
		Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.

But suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and 
cape with the initials "BR" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE 
RAJA.

					RAJA
		Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term 
		loosely... Unhand that youngster...

Another man steps into the light.  He wears a construction helmet and 
mask.  There is an "S" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel.  He 
is THE SHOVELER.

					SHOVELER
		Or you're mulch.

He brandishes his shovel for effect.  The Red Eyes look at these two, 
highly amused.

					BIG RED
		What are you guys supposed to be... 
		superheroes?

A third man steps out.  His costume is less dramatic than the others.  
He wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames 
on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his 
haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous 
of the three.  He is MISTER FURIOUS.

					FURIOUS
		We ARE superheroes!

					BIG RED
		Really?  Did you mother make those costumes?

The crooks howl with laughter.

					BIG RED
		This is our territory.  Beat it.

					FURIOUS
		Over YOUR dead body.

Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.

					BIG RED
		0ooooo, he's scary.

The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes 
through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.  He howls 
with pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.

					BIG RED
		A fork!

The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver 
forks.

					RAJA
		And there's plenty more where that came from.

Big Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of 
an old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth.  He 
is eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, 
taking huge bites out of it, container and all.

RAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp.  This was more than they'd 
bargained for.  But Furious just growls; he's game.

					BIG RED
		GET 'EM!

The Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his 
hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming 
crooks...

A Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his 
shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan.  The crook yelps with 
pain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks, 
poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, 
watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.  (There's no real 
martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley 
brouhaha.)

But there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging 
fists... and so does the Shoveler...

Furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and 
rights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of 
him and crushing him under his massive weight.

					RED EYES
		Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!

					FURIOUS
			(barely audible under all that meat)
		Is that all you got?

					RED EYES
		He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him 
		off!

					FURIOUS
					(faintly)
		Your mother!

Mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative 
voice is heard.

					VOICE (0.S.)
		Is there a problem?

Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN 
AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the 
light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique 
sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting 
heroically in the wind.  He is superhero perfection incarnate.

ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...

					RED EYES
		IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!

Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca-
like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.  As the baby claps his 
hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing 
deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly 
delivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he 
doesn't even break a sweat.

The remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in 
surrender.

					RED EYES
		We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible 
		childhoods!  (Etc.)

Police cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and 
the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and 
reporters...

Our three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh 
as a daisy).

					RAJA
		Nice work, Captain.

But Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they 
didn't even exist.  He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer 
to Connie Chung).

					AMAZING
			(turning on the old superhero charm)
		Hi. Dawn.

					DAWN
			(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)
		Looks like you've done it again, Captain.

					AMAZING
		It's what I do.

Our heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated.  Furious growls.  
Suddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.

					COP 1
		Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand--
		we're superheroes, and we just busted up this 
		gang.

					COP 1
		Really?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and 
		he's...
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Captain Pooper Scooper!

The cops crack up.  Furious growls at them.  The cops yank out their 
nightsticks.

					COP 1
		Hey!  Move it!

					COP 2
		Get a life!

					COP 1
		And leave crime fighting to the real thing!

Shoveler and Raja pull Furious away before he gets into real trouble... 
The cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.

					COP 1
		Wannabes.

					COP 2
		Pathetic.

EXT.  THE LAKESIDE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

An inner city greasy spoon.

INT.  THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

on which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being 
interviewed by Dawn Wong.  He's playing the cutsy photo op for all its 
worth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc.  Dawn is creaming.

Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the 
tube...

					RAJA
				(nursing a sore jaw)
		He doesn't miss a trick, does he?

					FURIOUS
		What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!

					SHOVELER
		Oh don't start that again--

					FURIOUS
		LOOK!

Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good 
looking guy in a tux at a benefit... The headline reads "Lance Hunt 
Hosts Benefit."  He holds the picture up next to the television, so the 
faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.  It is 
obviously the same guy.

					FURIOUS
		He's Lance Hunt!  Just take off the glasses--
		and it's him!

					RAJA
		There's a vague similarity.

					FURIOUS
		A vague similarity?  IT'S THE SAME GUY!

					SHOVELER
				(downing some aspirin)
		0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take 
		this anymore.  Night after night we're on the 
		streets, busting our humps--and for what?

					RAJA
		We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

					SHOVELER
		How long do you have to chase a dream before 
		you realize it's not gonna happen?

					FURIOUS
		We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever 
		heard of him until he busted Casanova 
		Frankenstein!

					RAJA
		But look at him... and look at us.

					SHOVELER
		The camera loves him.

A depressed silence.  Furious turns his attention to the napkin 
dispenser.

					FURIOUS
				     (furious)
		Why do they always fill stuff these things so 
		full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 
		'em!
				   (rips one out)

					RAJA
		I lost another fork tonight.  She's getting 
		suspicious, I know it.

					FURIOUS
		So why don't you just tell her!

					RAJA
		I can't.

					FURIOUS
		Why not?

					RAJA
				     (upset)
		Because I can't!  Okay?  She wouldn't 
		understand!

					SHOVELER
		Leave him alone.  She's his mother, not yours.

					FURIOUS
		We had an off night, that's all.

					SHOVELER
		So when are we gonna have an on night?

A WAITRESS is standing at the table.

					WAITRESS
		Hi.

They look at her, taken aback.  She's very pretty.

					RAJA
		You're... new.

					WAITRESS
		It's my first night.  My name's Monica.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her.  
Under all that rage, he's in fact shy.

					MONICA
		You guys going to a costume party?

					RAJA
		We're superheroes.

					MONICA
		Really?  Like Captain Amazing?

Furious growls.

					MONICA
		Are you famous?

					RAJA
		Not yet.

					MONICA
		So you're like... struggling superheroes?

					RAJA
		We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I 
		am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...
				(does a very impressive
				little flipping thing with
				his place setting)

					MONICA
		Wow.

					RAJA
		And these are my associatiates, the Shoveler.
	
					SHOVELER
		Hi.

					RAJA
		And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.

					MONICA
				(intrigued by Furious)
		Really?

					RAJA
		Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or 
		a great skill.  In his case, it's entirely 
		emotional.

					MONICA
		So what can I get you?

					RAJA
		Burgers all around.
				(meaning himself)
		Medium.
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Rare.
				(meaning Furious}
		Raw.

A moment later as Monica walks away, Furious can't help but
watch her.  The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good 
stuff from his coat.

					RAJA
		She likes you.

					SHOVELER
		Definitely.

					RAJA
		Ask her out.

					FURIOUS
		Nah.

					RAJA
		Roy, when was the last time you had an actual 
		date?

					FURIOUS
				(getting very pissed off)
		What does it matter?  Women just want to 
		control you--and talk about their feelings.  
		They want to know why you're angry all the 
		time--and what can they can do to help--so you 
		tell them there's nothing--nothing--just leave 
		me alone--but they bug you and they bug you and 
		they bug you--until you just can't stand it 
		anymore!--so you finally open up--you pop like 
		a blister--and it all comes spewing out--all 
		your emotions--your feelings--your fears--all 
		of it!
					(after a beat)
		And then they dump you.

					RAJA
		So you're chicken?

					FURIOUS
				     (fiercely)
		Who's chicken?
					(gets up)

Monica stands at the counter placing her order.  Furious approaches 
her, leans against the counter.  For a moment he just stands there, 
fuming, unable to think of anything to say. She isn't sure what to make 
of this.

					FURIOUS
		Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you 
		really want to talk to somebody you can't think 
		of anything to say!

					MONICA
		I guess... Are you always so angry?

					FURIOUS
		Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?

She shrugs.

					FURIOUS
		Want to go out and get drunk?

She's visibly turned off by that.

					FURIOUS
		Or talk?

					MONICA
		Not tonight.
			(picks up an order and walks away)

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE DINER - LATER

Furious, the Raja, and the Shoveler step out.

					RAJA
		Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

					FURIOUS
			(gets on his old Harley)
		Like what?  Cutting off my own ear?

					RAJA
		Or flowers.

					FURIOUS
		See ya tomorrow.

Furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the 
Shoveler opens the door of his battered Ford Esquire station wagon, and 
the Raja gets into his ancient Datsun.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The Shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house. The 
front yard looks like a battle zone.  Bikes and kids' junk are 
everywhere.

LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

as big a disaster area as the front yard. His kids, EDDIE JR. (15), 
LENORE (12), BUTCH (10), TRACY (7), and ROLAND (5) are all sprawled in 
front of the television. The Shoveler enters, and his kids don't even 
bother to look up from the tube.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place 
		up?

					TRACY
		When you're on TV.

					EDDIE JR.
		Right--like that will ever happen.

					LENORE
		Save any babies lately?

ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.

					TRACY
		Faster than a speeding turtle--

					BUTCH
		More powerful than a deodorant--

					EDDIE JR.
		Able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting--

					LENORE
		Look, snoring in his chair--

					EDDIE JR.
		Sitting on the john--

					ALL
		It's... Supergut!

The kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well) as the 
Shoveler dejectedly walks into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

The Shoveler enters, dejected.  His wife, Lucille, is doing the dishes.  
She looks up, sees him.

					LUCILLE
				  (feels for him)
		Rough night, Eddie?

He nods.

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

The Raja's Datsun is parked in front of a neat as a pin little 
Victorian house.

INT.  THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark.  Someone is sneaking around.  A drawer is quietly 
opened, and we hear the gentle clink of silver. Suddenly, the light 
goes on and we see the Blue Raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and 
slacks, with his hand in the drawer.  His MOTHER, in her nightclothes, 
stands by the door where she has just switched on the light.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey!

					RAJA
		Oh hi, Mom.

					MOTHER
		What are you doing in the silver drawer?

					RAJA
		Looking for... the TV Guide.

She just looks at him, very suspicious.

					MOTHER
		It's on the television.

					RAJA
		Of course.  I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.  
		Go to bed.

He kisses her and goes into the next room.  CAMERA HOLDS ON MOM; she 
doesn't trust him.

EXT.  HILLTOP - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

A billboard overlooking the city.  Captain Amazing is posed wearing a 
pair of bright blue Nikes.  The caption reads. "It's a nice world.  
Sonebody's got to save it... The Nike Supershoe.  It's Amazing."

Furious sits on his Harley, taking long hauls from a pint bottle of 
cheap bourbon and gazing up at the sign.

					FURIOUS
		Amazing?  What's so amazing about him?  I'd be 
		amazing, too, if I'd inherited two hundred 
		million bucks... or two bucks... or two 
		cents...
			(hurls the empty bottle, smashing
				it against the sign)
		Who am I kidding?  Dreams don't come true.

A moment of despondency, and then he hears a strange sound overhead and 
looks up...

HIS POV -

as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above 
him...

It is Captain Amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...


					FURIOUS
		Where's he going?
			(kicks his Harley started)

SERIES OF SHOTS - WITH MUSIC

as Furious, following Captain Amazing, rides roughshod down the steep 
hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential 
area...

He cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and 
rides smoothly along it, following Amazing... He turns off the tracks, 
rides roughly through some woods, then emerges from the trees and 
sees..

A foreboding looking old mansion... Captain Amazing lands on the 
highest part of its roof... Furious pulls up, gazes at the front gates 
of the mansion...

HIS POV -

Letters across the iron gates read... "Frankenstein".

EXT.  ON THE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Captain Amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate 
roof like Spiderman, leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking 
along a high ridge like a tight rope walker. Finally he approaches a 
skylight, looks down and sees...

A huge old library with an iron catwalk running around it. Casanova 
Frankenstein sits in a club chair by a roaring tire. Anabel perches on 
the arm of his chair.  In the other chair sits a once good looking, now 
paunchy guy, with a meticulously coiffed haircut.  He is TONY 
POMPADOUR, head of the infamous Disco Boys.

0N CAPTAIN AMAZING

					AMAZING
				(just as he suspected)
		Uh-huh.

He sees that the skylight is open, and quietly lets himself in...

INT.  THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Tony P savor glasses of brandy and puff on big cigars.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you enjoy these cigars.  I had to kill a 
		dozen Cubans to get them.

					TONY P
		Ummm.

					CASANOVA
		Have you considered my offer?

					TONY P
		You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved 
		workin' for you.  You had such style: the 
		clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd 
		snuff a babe.  You were the King...

Casanova accepts this graciously.

					TONY P
		But times have changed, and you been in that 
		bug house a long tine. I can see you still got 
		the style, but I dunno for sure you still got 
		the edge.

					CASANOVA
		I got it.

					TONY P
		What about Captain Amazing?

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Good question.

Casanova and Tony P look up and see Captain Amazing, posed noncalantly 
on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.  Tony P jumps out of his 
chair, scared.  But Casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as 
a cucumber.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd cone.  I left that skylight open 
		for you.

					AMAZING
		I know you did.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd know.

					AMAZING
		I know you knew I'd know.

					CASANOVA
		But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?

					AMAZING
		Of course.

Tony P makes a move for his pistol, but Captain Amazing instantly whips 
out his pistol, getting the drop on him.

					AMAZING
		I'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of 
		scum like you, Tony.

Tony freezes.

					AMAZING
		The jig is up, Casanova.  I've spent six months 
		watching you, and know exactly what you're up 
		to.

					CASANOVA
		Really?

					AMAZING
		I know that you're recruiting your old 
		henchmen...

Nervous reaction from Tony P.

					AMAZING
		I know who your girlfriend really is...

Icy reaction from Anabel.

					AMAZING
		And I know the terrible revenge that you plan 
		to inflict on this city.

					CASANOVA
		I guess you know just about everything, don't 
		you, Lance?

					AMAZING
		Um-hmm.

					CASANOVA
		Except for one little thing.

					AMAZING
				(supremely confident)
		And what's that?

					CASANOVA
		That I've hot wired the city's entire power 
		supply through that catwalk.

					AMAZING
		What--?

Casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch, and the ugly hum of a 
million volts instantly fills the room...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - ON FURIOUS

still watching... as all the lights in the house go out, except for a 
frightening orange glow in an upper room...

Off in the distance Furious sees... the lights of the entire city 
flicker and then black out... A moment later the mansion, and the 
city's lights return to normal... as Furious watches, not sure what to 
make of this.

EXT. STREET CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Traffic is snarled.  Horns are blasting.  Tempers are frayed.

CLOSE ON A HAMMERING JACKHAMMER... CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL that it is 
being operated by the Shoveler, dressed in work clothes.  Wiped out 
from the night before, the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off 
to sleep... He nods out... as his BOSS whacks him on the arm.

					BOSS
		YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX!  Get your shut-eye at 
		home, or you'll be a full time superhero!

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT.  THE RAJA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as 
he watches... an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.

					ANTHONY
		It's all within your power.  The only thing 
		that's in your way is YOU!

					RAJA
		Easy for you to say.

EXT.  SALLY'S AUTO DEMOLITION - DAY - ESTABLISHING

An auto junkyard and demotion yard.

EXT.  THE YARD - DAY

A giant press mashes an old car... while nearby Mister Furious does the 
job by hand, demolishing an old Grand Prix with an iron bar.  He does 
it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping 
off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing 
the pieces onto a big pile... His big boned, red faced boss SALLY is 
calling out to him.

					SALLY
		Hey, Roy!

EXT.  THE BACK OF THE YARD - A MINUTE LATER

In a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard Sally and Furious stand 
looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle. It is a Herkimer Battle 
Jitney, a heavily armored, windowless, soundproof, personnel carrier 
(designed by the Pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on 
battlefield fact finding tours).  Overgrown with weeds, home to an 
extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are 
over.

					SALLY
		How many times I gotta tell you about this?

					FURIOUS
		Sally, that's a Herkimer Battle Jitney!  They 
		don't make 'em like that anymore.  It's a 
		classic!

					SALLY
		It's a hunk of junk.  I want the iron.  Do it!

She walks away.  Furious growls.  He picks up his iron bar and is about 
to wedge it under the front bumper of the Herkimer...

HIS POV -

But the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at 
hint, imploring him for one last chance...

And he just can't do it.  He throws away his iron bar and climbs inside 
the cab of the Herkimer...

IN THE CAB - CONTINUOUS

Furious sits behind the wheel and tenderly touches its beat-up old 
dashboard, then turns on the radio, which, miraculously still works.  
He tunes in a local station, puts his feet up on the dash.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		...and continues to deny any knowledge of the 
		incident... In local news, millionaire Lance 
		Hunt has apparently disappeared...

ON FURIOUS, taking immediate notice.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		Members at his household told police that the 
		playboy philanthropist failed to return home 
		last night after "going out for a walk".  
		Police say they have no reason yet to suspect 
		foul play, but a search is under way...

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Furious, the Shoveler, and the Raja all sit at their booth.

					FURIOUS
		I saw him go in--and he didn't come out!
	
					RAJA
		But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

Furious groans.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, look.

ON THE TV -

Casanova is being interviewed by DON STOUFFER, the local Mike Wallace.

					CASANOVA
		Well, Don, I've done some terrible things in my 
		life, but now I'm cured, and I just want to 
		give back something to my old home town... 
		That's why I'm using what's left of my fortune 
		to build...

CLOSE ON A MODEL of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure 
(i.e.  the Getty)

					CASANOVA (O.S.)
		The Frankenstein Center for the Arts.

					DON
		You've changed, haven't you?

		CASANOVA
		Oh yes.

BACK ON FURIOUS, RAJA, and SHOVELER - 

					FURIOUS
		No he hasn't.

EXT.  FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

the wall of the estate... as our heroes' three heads rise up over  
it... and survey the grounds.

					FURIOUS
				(about to climb over)
		Let's go.

					RAJA
			(in a whisper, holding him back)
		Wait!... Look!

THEIR POV -

A group of men are hanging around the door to the house, smoking, 
chatting, and laughing.  A CLOSER ANGLE REVEALS that they are all 
dressed in the height (or depths) of seventies disco fashion.  One of 
them is showing off some steps.

Our heroes fall back behind the safety of the wall and confer.


					RAJA
		This is bad.

					SHOVELER
		Who are they?

					RAJA
		The Disco Boys.


					FURIOUS
		The who?

					RAJA
		The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever 
		produced.  Twenty years ago they were 
		Casanova's personal bodyguard.  But after he 
		was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

					FURIOUS
		Well they've crawled back out.

					SHOVELER
		We may be getting in over our heads here.

					RAJA
		This looks like a job for Superman--

					SHOVELER
		Or Batman--

					RAJA
		Or both.

					FURIOUS
		Don't you guys get it?  If Captain Amazing is 
		still in there, we can rescue him--and get on 
		TV!
			   (goes right over the wall)

They share an exasperated look, then scramble over the wall after him.

INT.  CASANOVA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Dr. Anabel Leek are preparing for bed.  Anabel sits in 
front of a huge mirror, brushing her long hair as Casanova moves up 
behind her and puts his hands around her throat, massaging, squeezing, 
just barely resisting the temptation to strangle her.  (She loves it).

					CASANOVA
		Everything's going exactly as we planned.

					ANABEL
			(puts the sharp point of her
			comb handle under his chin)
		Not quite.  You haven't announced our 
		engagement yet.

					CASANOVA
		It must have slipped my mind.

					ANABEL
		Your mind is so slippery.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Pootchkie.  My womanizing days are 
		over.  You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my 
		Nicole.
				(pulls her into his arms)
		We're such an incredible team.  Who could 
		possibly stop us?
		(kisses her)

CUT RIGHT TO:

EXT.  THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS - ON OUR THREE HEROES

as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard.

					RAJA
		Don't crunch the leaves.

					SHOVELER
		Sorry.

					RAJA
		Be a Mohican.
	    		   (bumps into a lawn chair)

					FURIOUS
		Wait.
				(They all stop.)
		I hear something.

They all listen; there is a low rushing sound... It is the sound of 
water rushing through pipes.  Suddenly, the lawn sprinklers all pop 
up... and our heroes get drenched.  They duck off the lawn, behind the 
cover of a large tree.

					RAJA
		I'm soaked.
				    (sneezes)
		Oh great.

					FURIOUS
		Shhh.

					SHOVELER
		Be a Mohican. 

					RAJA
		Shut up.

Furious sees a pair of French doors, off a small patio.  One of the 
doors is slightiy open.

					FURIOUS
		Come on.

They start sneaking toward it, but as they cross the patio... they trip 
the automatic security lighting, and suddenly find themselves bathed in 
light.

					RAJA
		Uh-oh.

As our heroes look around as a dozen Disco Boys, armed with pipes, 
chains, brass knuckles, step into the light and encircle them... The 
French doors open and Tony P steps out.

					RAJA
		Oh I'm sorry.  We must have the wrong house.

					TONY P
		You sure do.

The Disco Boys attack.  The Raja is instantly clubbed down. The 
Shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes 
down, too... These guys are not the Red Eyes.

Only Furious holds his own.  He grabs a pipe away from one of them and 
swings fiercely, keeping the others off.  Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull 
back.  Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...

Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.

					CASANOVA
		Hi there.

With a cat-like move Casanova slashes his gold chain viciously--and 
repeatedly--across Furious' face.  Furious, stunned with pain, lunges 
at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast 
combination of spinning disco kicks.  Finally he lassos the chain 
around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.

ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...

Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground.  Casanova steps 
away, and the Disco Boys gather around Furious and kick him 
viciously... as Casanova and Tony P watch, amused, chuckling.

					CASANOVA
		Superheroes.

					TONY P
		Should I kill them?

					CASANOVA
				(completely disdainful)
		Why bother?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE MANSION - A MOMENT LATER

The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like 
bags of garbage into the street... where thay lie in a moaning, 
agonized, semi-conscious heap.

INT.  THE DINER - LATER - CLOSE ON

Furious, rubbing his neck; a thin red mark runs around it. The three of 
them are sitting at their usual table, in very bad shape, moaning and 
groaning... Monica approaches.  She's made them ice packs and cold 
compresses.

					MONICA
		Here you go.
			(sits with them, applies a compress
				to the Raja's head)

					RAJA
		Ow.

					MONICA
		Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero 
		stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

A FUSSY CUSTOMER is calling out from another table.

					FUSSY CUSTORER
		Miss!

She moves off.

					RAJA
		Maybe she's right.

					FURIOUS
				(still furious)
		Are you serious? This is the break we've been 
		waiting for!

					SHOVELER
		What are you talking about?

					FURIOUS
		What have the famous superheroes got that we 
		don't?

					RAJA
		Agents?

					FURIOUS
		Archenemies!  Casanova isn't just a criminal--
		he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our 
		ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!

					SHOVELER
		And it would be the right thing to do.

					FURIOUS
				   (dismissively)
		Yeah yeah--and that, too.

					RAJA
		But there's only three of us, and he's got the 
		entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.

					FURIOUS
		Then maybe it's time for us to form our own 
		brotherhood...
					(more)
	
					FURIOUS (Cont'd)
		a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, 
		skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of 
		the night!

					SHOVELER
		I'm liking this.

					FURIOUS
		I say we send out the word--and summon all of 
		the unsung superheroes we know!

					RAJA
				(after a moment)
		Yeah, but... who do we know?

They take a long moment to ponder this.

					FURIOUS
		Well... there's the Spleen.

Shoveler and Raja make disgusted noises.

					RAJA
		Do we have to?

					SHOVELER
		I got this cousin.  He's a real doofus, but he 
		claims he can become invisible.

					FURIOUS
		Have you ever seen him?

					SHOVELER
		How could I see him if he's invisible?

					FURIOUS 
		Good point.

					RAJA
		And there's the Sphinx.

					SHOVELER
		The who?

					RAJA
		He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting 
		superwrestler and master of the machete.

					FURIOUS
		Sounds good.

					RAJA
		No one's sure that he actually exists, but they 
		say he can be contacted by leaving a message on 
		a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by 
		the bus station.

					SHOVELER
		Get outta here.

EXT.  TACKY TACO - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A funky Mexican restaurant by the bus station.

INT.  THE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes, in normal clothing, have just finished a taco lunch.  
Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.

					FURIOUS
		You sure that's how you spell it?

					SHOVELER
		Yeah.

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Spinks, we need you."

They crumple up the napkin and leave the restaurant... A moment later a 
shy looking MEXICAN MAN busses their tray... but in A CLOSE ANGLE we 
see him secretly pocket the napkin.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A little brick house.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of 
the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc.  
INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister 
Furious, and the Shoveler.

					FURIOUS
		So, let me get this straight.  You have the 
		power to become invisible.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		But... only when no one is looking.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		If someone looks at you, you immediately become 
		visible again.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible... to yourself?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		No.

					OUR HEROES
					(hopefully)
		No?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		If I look at myseif, I become visible.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no 
		one is looking at you?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		So how do you know that you've ever been 
		invisible?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I just know.

Our heroes are less than impressed.

					FURIOUS
		Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to 
		interview--

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(desperate)
		I know I haven't got it entirely worked out 
		yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a 
		superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? 
		Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a 
		chance?

ON OUR HEROES, looking around the room... and softening up.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Our heroes sit at their usual table along with Invisible Boy and a 
weird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit.  Across 
his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and 
that's exactly who he is.  Furious, the Raja, and Shoveler sit as far 
away from him as possible. He is a totally noxious, hyperactive 
person... and he is thrilled to be there.

					SPLEEN
		Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when 
		you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?
				   (sucks it in)
		I've always dreamed of being a member of the a 
		real superhero team--and to have friends--real 
		friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep 
		with--die with--eat with...

He puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into 
his mouth.

					SPLEEN
		I love mustard.

Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've 
actually invited this guy to join their group.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		So what exactly is your superpower?

					SPLEEN
		Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal-
		-remember that?--and my brothers and I used to 
		go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it--
		stuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died, 
		but I lived, and I grew all these like weird 
		organs that have never been seen in humans 
		before.  So now I can do things like this!

He leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle 
dribble onto the table...

CLOSE ON THE TABLE -

as the spittle burns a hole in the Formica.

					SPLEEN
		Cool, huh?

The Spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three 
heroes duck out of the way or under the table.

				FURIOUS, RAJA, & SHOVELER
		Watch it!... Look out!... Whoa!

The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands 
to their mouths, and immediately leave.

					SPLEEN
		Sorry, sorry.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?

					SPLEEN
		I tried that once.  The cork melted.

THE SAME - AFTER DINNER

Our heroes mull their situation over coffee.  Monica freshens their 
cups.  The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.

					SHOVELER
		There's just not enough of us.

					FURIOUS
		But we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe 
		thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who 
		desperately need a cause...

					RAJA
		And a social life.

					SHOVELER
		Yeah, but how do we get to them?

					SPLEEN
		Obscene phone calls?

They ignore that suggestion.

					MONICA
		Why don't you throw a barbecue?
			(moves off to another table)

ON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT - WITH MUSIC

Invisible Boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little 
notes on small file cards.  (He's made a whole pile of them.)

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Got superpowers?  Want to fight evil?  Then JOIN US and 
let's PARTY HEARTY!  Beer!  Burgers!  Babes!"

SERIES OF SHOTS - MUSIC CONTINUES

as our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where 
lonely superheroes night find them...

The Raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...

The Shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...

Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone 
booth...

At an abandoned drive-in movie theater... Invisible Boy walks through 
the empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...

A White Castle hamburger joint... Inside the pay toilet Spleen is 
scratching something on the wall with a nail. He stops and admires his 
handiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the 
wall...

END MUSIC.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - DAY

A small, typical working class backyard.  A round, aluminum above 
ground pool.  A Weber grill with burgers on it. Unopened packages of 
hamburger rolls.  An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box.  The 
Spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.

					SPLEEN
		Come on in!  The water's great!

In fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... The rest of our 
heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs.  No superheroes have shown 
up.  The Shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand 
in line waiting for them.

					BUTCH
				(heavy on the sarcasm)
		Great picnic, Dad.

					EDDIE JR.
		Big turnout.

					ROLAND
		Are these guys real superheroes?

					LENORE
		They think so.

The kids scoff...  A moment later they head back to the house with 
their burgers.

					ROLAND
		But where's Captain Amazing?

					EDDIE JR.
		He wouldn't be caught dead here.

They go into the house.  No one says anything.  The Shoveler just 
stares at the burgers on the grill.  Vic Damon sings. Furious chugs his 
beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.

ON THE SPLEEN, munching on a chlorine tablet.

					SPLEEN
		Hey, these pool mints are delicious!

Raja looks at his watch.

					RAJA
		Maybe there was traffic.

					FURIOUS
		Who are we kidding?  No one's gonna show.  
		We're living in a fantasy!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.

					FURIOUS
		Good or evil, what's the difference?

					SHOVELER
		There's a big difference.

					FURIOUS
		I used to believe that.  Now I'm not so sure.

					RAJA
		Roy, remember, it is all within your power.  
		The only thing that's in your way... is you.

					FURIOUS
		Oh shut up.

Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.  Everyone immediately perks up.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		They're here!

A moment later they open the gate and see... HALF A DOZEN BURLY GUYS 
wearing various superhero outfits.

					THEIR LEADER
		Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?

					RAJA
		This is it.  Come on in!

					SUPERHEROES
		All right!  Party!  (Etc.)

At first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are 
decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain 
capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them.  Their leader holds a 
squeegee with a long handle... Furious is suspicious.

					RAJA
		I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.

					THEIR LEADER
		I am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres, 
		the Invincible Dudes!

The Invincible Dudes spot the keg.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Whoa!  Brews!  Party!  (Etc.)

They go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling 
them down.  The Raja tries to hand out some forms.

					RAJA
		Would you mind filling out these forms; names, 
		addresses, description of superpowers, that 
		sort of thing.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Sure, dude.  No problem.  (Etc.)
			(but they just toss the forms away)

ON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 1
		Hey, man, like where are the babes?

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 2
		It said on the card there'd be babes!

					RAJA
		Actually we lied about the babes, but there's 
		plenty of burgers.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		That's false advertising!... We came all the 
		way from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone 
		plinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No babes.  No peace.

					INVISIBLE DUDES (chanting)
		No babes--no peace!  No babes--no peace!  No 
		babes--no peace!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		Let's trash the place!

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Yeah!

Furious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.

					FURIOUS
		If you're a superhero, what's your power?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		I am Squeegee Man.
			(holding it out threateningly)
		Touch my squeegee... and you die.

The Invincible Dudes are cracking up.

					FURIOUS
		Can you fly?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No.

					FURIOUS
		Wanna bet?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE YARD - CONTINUOUS

as Squeegee Man comes flying--and screaming--over the fence, landing 
none too gracefully in the front yard.

A beat and his squeegee come flying out after him.  Another beat and 
the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!

They take off down the street, running right past a woman, carrying a 
bowling ball bag and dressed in a faded, threadbare old rayon superhero 
costume with a decidedly fifties flavor. She is THE BOWLER.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - A MOMENT LATER

Our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		Who died?

They look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to 
make of her.

					RAJA
		Who are you?

					BOWLER
		I'm the Bowler.

					SHOVELER
		The Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a
		kid.  He was killed years ago.

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

Our heroes share a look.

					SHOVELER
		Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a
		guy thing.

					BOWLER
		Really?

She takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like 
a Harlem Globetrotter).  For a long moment she just looks at them, 
smiling.

ON THE OTHERS watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...

Suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the 
ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war 
club--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...

Then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... It shoots 
straight through Invisible Boy's legs...

ON A NEATLY PLACED COLLECTION OF PLASTER LAWN DWARVES -

as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... It goes into a 
reverse spin, passes through Invisible Boy's legs again, and returns to 
the Bowler who is holding its bag open for it... The ball rolls in.

					BOWLER
		Good ball.

ON OUR HEROES, left absolutely speechless.

					BOWLER
		If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be 
		impressed, right?

She turns and walks out.  Our heroes share an amazed look, then run 
after her...

JUST OUTSIDE THE GATE - ON THE BOWLER

walking away... as Furious catches up with her.

					FURIOUS
		Hey... Can I buy you a beer?

					BOWLER
		I thought you'd never ask.

She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's 
backyard... but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place 
between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a 
frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep 
shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.  We do not 
know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.

BACK AT THE BARBECUE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON

A FADED OLD SNAPSHOT of the original "The Bowler" holding a little girl 
in his arms.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		He was more than just a superhero...  He was my 
		father...

The others, touched by this, have gathered around the Bowler, who is 
holding the old snapshot in her hand.

					BOWLER
		And then one day, he didn't come home.  The 
		police said it was an accident.  But cargo 
		containers don't just fall on people.  He was 
		murdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped 
		out of school, became a mud wrestler, married 
		and divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit 
		bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her 
		attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and 
		costume, almost like he'd left them there for 
		me... and I knew what I had to do.

					SHOVELER
		So who killed him?
	
					BOWLER
		The Disco Boys.

					FURIOUS
		You know something? Those guys are really 
		starting TO PISS ME OFF!

					SHOVELER
		But there's still only six of us.

					FURIOUS
		SO WHAT?

					BOWLER
		That's two more than the Fantastic Four.

					FURIOUS
		Half a Dirty Dozen!

					SPLEEN
		Twice the Three Stooges!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		And only one short of the Magnificent Seven.

					RAJA
		And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.

					BOWLER
		He was cute though.

					RAJA
		But they all had one thing we haven't got.

					SPLEEN
		Girlfriends?

					RAJA
		A name.  All the great superhero teams have got 
		a fabulous name.

They all think about it for a moment.  You can almost smell their 
brains overheating.

					BOWLER
		How about... the Savage Six?

					RAJA
		The Inscrutable Six?

					SPLEEN
		The Six Pistols?

					SHOVELER
		The Exterminators!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The Obliterators!

					RAJA
		The Eradicators!

					BOWLER
		The Emasculators!

					SPLEEN
		Wait--I got it!... The Spleen Team.

He gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.

					FURIOUS
		To hell with a name.  Let's get to work.

MUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.  The others stand and follow 
him... as our heroes form up for their first HEROIC GROUP SHOT.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as A LITTLE OLD LADY crosses the street, when suddenly 
she looks up and sees a pair of headlights coming on fast.  An 
immaculately maintained seventies limo is heading straight for her.

INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Disco Boys sit in the front.  Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit in the 
back, dressed for a night on the town...

There is a thud as the limo hits the old lady, and everyone in the car 
explodes into laughter.

					TONY P
		Little old lady.  That's a hundred points!

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE LIMO - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the limo drives past a billboard with an ad for "MILK" with a milk 
mustached Captain Amazing looking at the camera...

					TONY P
		He knows your every move.

Tony P imitates a massive electrical convulsion, and the villains crack 
up.

But as they pass the billboard, a pair of headlights illuminate in its 
shadows, and the Shoveler's Ford Esquire pulls out and follows.

INSIDE THE ESQUIRE - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is driving.  Mister Furious sits in the front seat next to 
him, and our other heroes are packed into the back.

					FURIOUS
		Let's say hello.

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE TWO CARS - CONTINUOUS

As the limo stops at a traffic light... and the Esquire pulls up 
alongside it.  For a moment good and evil stare each other down.

					TONY P
		Not these guys again!

The Disco Boys howl with laughter.

					CASANOVA
		Nice car.

The D Boys laugh.  Furious stares at Casanova, and Casanova stares 
right back at him, as cool as a snake.

					FURIOUS
		What did you do with Captain Amazing?

					CASANOVA
		Captain who?

					TONY P
				(spots the Bowler)
		Hey, in the backseat, who are you supposed to 
		be, the Bowler?

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

					TONY P
		His daughter?  Well guess what, sweetheart?  
		I'm the one who squished your Daddy.  And he 
		squished real good!

The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE.  He swings 
open his car door, mashing it into the limo and leaving a big dent.

					TONY P
		HEY!

					FURIOUS
		'SCUSE ME!

He starts punching the limo like it's a punching bag--putting big dents 
in it.

					TONY
		Waste him!

Tony and the boys all reach into their coats for their pistols--but as 
they yank them out, the Spleen sticks his head out of the station 
wagon, puts his face right up to the open window of the limo and lets 
loose with a TREMENDOUS BELCH...

As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes 
on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big 
dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening 
the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the 
back of his hand...

Then he leaps up on top of the limo...

While inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are stomped into 
the roof above them...

ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHEILD as Furious leaps down onto the hood, and 
gazes in at them.

					FURIOUS
		Shall I check your oil?

He plunges his hand through the metal of the hood, pulls out the car's 
dip stick, and checks it.

					FURIOUS
		Looks fine.

He tosses the dip stick away, then leaps off JUST AS Tony P gets off a 
shot, EXPLODING the windshield of the limo.

Furious lands safely on the hood of the station wagon.  As the Shoveler 
throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...

					FURIOUS
		NICE CAR!

And our heroes streak off into the night... Casanova and the others 
stagger out of the demolished limo, sucking in the clean air.

					CASANOVA
				(impressed by Furious)
		That boy's got talent.

					TONY P
		And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.

ANGLE ON A DARKENED ALLEY -

where the man in the strange steel mask can be seen... watching.

EXT.  A BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A very typical, nondescript neighborhood place...

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes stand at the bar, celebrating their first victory.

					SHOVELER
		To us!

					RAJA
		Whatever our name is.

They toast and drink.

THE SAME - LATER

The Spleen is passed out at a table, snoring. Shoveler and Invisible 
Boy sit next to him.

					SHOVELER
		Even his snores smell bad.

Raja and Bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.

					BOWLER
		But she's your mother.  You gotta tell her.

					RAJA
		I can't.

ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid 
		waste of time.

					SHOVELER
		But he plays golf, right?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yeah.

BACK ON RAJA AND BOWLER -

					RAJA
		I'm her only son, and she always had such high 
		hopes for me. Medicine.  Law.

					BOWLER
		But you're a superhero.

					RAJA
		The cape.  The turban.  She wouldn't 
		understand.

					BOWLER
		I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I 
		put on the mask.  They thought I'd lost it.

					RAJA
		But in fact... you'd found it.

They clink their glasses and drink.

BACK ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY -

					SHOVELER
		This is your dream... and you can't ever give 
		it up.

The Spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I wonder what he dreams about?

					SHOVELER
		We don't want to know.

Mr. Furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry 
thoughts..

OUTSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

A black van drives slowly past the bar.

INSIDE THE VAN - CONTINUOUS

The van is packed with Disco Boys.  Tony P sits in the front seat.

					TONY P
		There.

HIS POV -

He has spotted the Ford Esquire parked in the lot.

BACK IN THE BAR - A LITTLE LATER

ON THE BOWLER AND RAJA -

					BOWLER
		It's late.  I'm headin' home.

					RAJA
		Me, too.

					BOWLER
				(to Invisible Boy)
		Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

JUST OUTSIDE - A MONENT LATER

As our heroes, carrying the Spleen, leave.

					FURIOUS
		Anybody up for a little White Castle?

But suddenly the world is a whirling sass of chains and clubs as they 
are bushwhacked by the Disco Boys...

EXT.  AN ALLEY - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as he comes to with a qroan and sees... the Bowler and Invisible Boy 
tied up and gagged, with the Raja, Shoveler, and the Spleen trussed up 
right next to them.  Furious looks up, sees Tony P standing over him.

					TONY P
		Hi, cutie.

Furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire 
chains.  Tony P takes out a large caliber revolver, flips it open to 
make sure it's loaded.

					TONY P
		Six losers. Six bullets. Perfect... Got any 
		last words, Angry Boy?

					FURIOUS
		Disco sucks.

					TONY P
		Disco sucks.  Very good.  You know what I'm 
		gonna do, Angry Boy, since you're so colorful?  
		I'm gonna save you for last.

He turns and points the pistol right at Invisible Boy's head. Furious 
struggles against his chains--to no avail.

					TONY P
		Sweet dreams, punk.

Invisible Boy closes his eyes... Tony P cocks the pistol... But 
suddenly, there is the ring of steel--a broad blade sweeps through the 
air, and Tony P's pistol is sliced neatly in half.

					TONY P
				(holding half a pistol)
		HOLY...

The man is the strange steel mask is standing there, the drawn machete 
still in his hand.

					MAN IN MASK
		Buenos naches.

					TONY P
		Get him!

The Disco Boys rush the newcomer, but he slices through their baseball 
bats with his machete, and sends them reeling and crashing into each 
other with expert forearm blows, whacks with the flat of his blade, and 
head butts with his mask.

Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are 
too strong... and the stranger doesn't need any help.

Tony P flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who 
sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him.  Tony P 
turns, about to charge again.

					MAN IN MASK
				    (Mexican accent)
		Would you like me to trim the sides?

					TONY P
		What?

Tony P feels the top of his head, and realizes that the blow from the 
machete has neatly sliced off the top his disco-do, leaving only 
stubble on the top of his head.

					TONY P
			     	  (freaking out)
		LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

Tony and the Disco Boys run for it...

Furious and the others study their masked savior, who stands before 
them, machete in hand.

					FURIOUS
		You're the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		And you are a fool.

He raises his machete above Furious' head... and then slices clean 
through the chains.

EXT.	AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

Our heroes have gathered around a scrap wood fire in a steel drum. They 
sit on the ground and on old car seats, feeling like schmucks as the 
Sphinx chews theu out, his mask looking very friqhtening and magical in 
the flickering light.

					SPHINX
		You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster 
		fights more intelligently than you!  You have 
		shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your 
		powers to him--and what have you accouplished 
		for this?  You have destroyed his car.  
		Brilliant!  If you want to survive you must 
		fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack!

Furious sulks, but the others get the point.

					SPHINX
		The wolf is cunning.  He knows that stealth is 
		his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a 
		team...
					(more)

				SPHINX (Cont'd)
				(at Furious)
		Not like some drunken Tejano on Saturday night.

Furious grunts.

					SPHINX
		Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil.  
		You will need more than shovels and dessert 
		forks to stop him... What else have you got?

They are silent.

					FURIOUS
				     (angrily)
		So what else has Superman got?

					SHOVELER
		He's got the fact that he's Superman!

					BOWLER
		Bullets bounce off him!

Furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.

					RAJA
		Firepower costs money.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Anybody got any?

A silence.

					SHOVELER
		We didn't think this through very well.

					BOWLER
				(after a moment)
		My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

Our heroes stand looking at an old farubouse.  The place is an absolute 
wreck.  It hasn't been painted in twenty-five years. Windows are 
boarded up.  Half the shingles are gone.  There's visible fire damage 
around the kitchen window.

					SHOVELER
		Are you sure he's still lives here?

					RAJA
		Are you sure he's still alive?

					BOWLER
		He was the last time I saw him.

					SHOVELER
		When was that?
	
					BOWLER
		I was eight.

She is about to knock, but the door is suddenly yanked open, and an 
eighty year old guy is standing there.  He's got a wild head of white 
hair (that looks like a living explosion), and he wears a stained old 
lab coat with stickum mtssages to himself stuck to it, non-matching 
slippers, and a pair of thick glasses with frames that have been 
composited of half a dozen different old pairs all taped and welded 
together into a fantastic concoction.  He is DOC HELLER.

					HELLER
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		Doctor Heller?

					HELLER
				(doesn't recognize her)
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		It's me... Elizabeth.

					HELLER
		Elizabeth!  Little Elizabeth!  Why you're so... 
		middle aged!

					BOWLER
		Thanks.

					HELLER
		How's your dad?

					BOWLER
		He's dead.

					HELLER
		Oh that's right--they squished him...  Heck of 
		a guy.

Furious throws a look at the Shoveler and Raja.  This guy's out of it.  
They're wasting their time.

					BOWLER
		Doc, these are my friends.  We're superheroes, 
		and we need your help.

					HELLER
		Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that 
		sort of covers--

					SPHINX
		Doctor, we need your weapons.

					HELLER
				    (ecstatic)
		My weapons? You need my weapons?

EXT.  BEHIND THE HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER - MOVING ANGLE

as Doctor Heller leads them all briskly across his overgrown yard 
toward... the barn.

					HELLER
		The military establishment has never understood 
		me.  They won't return my phone calls, much 
		less field test anything.  But I knew that 
		someday I'd get my chance, and now... here you 
		are!
			   (pulls open the barn door)

INT.  THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

As our heroes step into Heller's laboratory/arsenal.  A stack of small 
aluminum cans lines one wall.  There are weird lookinq sprayers, tubes, 
and strange homemade toy-like devices... but there isn't a firearm in 
sight.

					RAJA
		But, Doc... where's the machine guns?

					SHOVELER
		The bazookas?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The lasers?

					HELLER
		You don't need that junk!  You see, for 
		thousands of years mankind has been immolating, 
		disemboweling, and exploding itself.  Why?  
		Because we have this built-in screwed up need 
		to go to war!
					(more)

					HELLER (Cont'd)
		So as a young man I thought, why nat have the 
		fun and excitement of war, without all that 
		unnecessary bloodshed.  That's why I have 
		devoted my life to developing an arsenal of 
		highly sophisticated non-lethal military 
		weapons.
				(points to a hand held tube)
		Air cannons... Blame throwers... Feet seeking 
		missiles... And perhaps my ultimate 
		invention...
	   		   (picks up one of the small cans)
		The canned tornado.

Furious groans, and the others share a look.  This guy's really a nut.

					HELLER
		Now here's a beauty!
			(picks up a purple and orange sprayer
			that looks like a suped up water gun)
		I call it the Shrinker!  I developed it after 
		years of studying the worst dry cleaners I 
		could find.  It instantly shrinks fabrics to 
		half their size.  Anyone caught in its spray is 
		immediately immobilized by their own clothing!

					FURIOUS
		Let's get out of here.

Furious turns and goes out, and the others start to follow. But the 
Bowler picks up a canned tornado.

OUTSIDE THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

as Furious walks away, the Bowler steps out of the barn.

					BOWLER
		Hey, Mister Bad Mood.

Furious stops, turns back.

					BOWLER
			(pulls the ring on the can)
		Catch.

She tosses the can to him.  He catches it--just as a small angry 
tornado FUNNELS out of the can.  It catches Furious and lifts him high 
in the air... then dissipates to nothing...

A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.

ON THE OTHERS, amazed.

Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off.  He starts 
back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can. The others get 
out of his way, as, muttering angrily to himself, he goes back into the 
barn...

And emerges a moment later, toting the air cannon.

					HELLER
		He's got the air cannon!

The others think he's going to use it on them and scatter for cover. 
but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target... 
He sees an old abandoned outhouse, puts the air cannon to his shoulder, 
aims, and fires...

There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the 
cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn.  But 
the big rush of air hits the shed dead center... and BLOWS IT TO 
PIECES, leaving only the old seat.

Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.

					FURIOUS
		Doc, you're a genius!
				     (hugs him)

					HELLER
		I know.

					FURIOUS
				(turns to the others)
		Okay! We got the firepower!  I say we throw it 
		into the car, drive over to Casanova's house, 
		and kick some ass!

					SPHINX
		No.

The others ignore Furious and listen to the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		We are not yet ready.  Now we must learn to 
		fight together... as one thing.

The others nod in agreemnt... while Furious fumes.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - TRAINING AT THE FARM

CLOSE ON DOC HELLER aiming his air cannon... CAMERA PULLS BACK TO 
REVEAL our heroes (minus Furious) standing in a pack right behind him, 
holding him down. HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently, 
but it doesn't knock them over...

as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and 
shake their fists... while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines, 
drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.

VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team... crawling across 
the grass together....charginq in a line... hurling canned tornadoes... 
while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous 
of the Sphinx.

Shoveler, Bowler, and the Sphinx stand shoulder to shoulder, as 
Invisible Boy, Spleen, Raja, and the Doc throw small stones at them... 
They deflect the pebbles with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... 
Theyre having fun.  They're becoming a team...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE BARN - EVENING

Furious drinks alone, while the rest of our heroes sit around an old 
picnic table, feasting on sodas and pizza (like a football team after a 
great practice.)  Raja explains the history of the situation to the 
Sphinx.

					RAJA
		Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this 
		city were united into one great brotherhood of 
		evil, and Casanova was their king.

					SHOVELER
		Crime was rampant.  It wasn't safe to stay in 
		your home.

					BOWLER
		Much less go outside.

					SHOVELER
		Then Captain Amazing appeared.

					RAJA
		He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.

					SHOVELER
		And this has been a pretty nice place to live 
		ever since.

					FURIOUS
				    (pissed off)
		But now Casanova's back!  And we're gonna sit 
		around here all night eating pizza and telling 
		stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!

					SPHINX
		The wise snake coils before he strikes.

					FURIOUS
				(lunges at the Sphinx)
		And a skunk stinks!

Furious and the Sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.

					SPHINX
		You drink too much.

					FURIOUS
		When are you going to take off that mask?

					SPHINX
				    (pointedly)
		When I am sure I am among friends.

					RAJA
		Roy--

					FURIOUS
				(snapping at him)
		Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!

ON THE RAJA, hurt.

					SPHINX
		Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds 
		you to your heart.

					FURIOUS
		My heart died a long time ago.

					SPHINX
		It is not dead.  It is hiding.

					FURIOUS
		Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to 
		hell with the rest of you!... Look at you.  
		Bunch of rejects.  I didn't need you before--
		and I don't need you now!
			(jumps on to his motorcycle)
		The great ones RIDE ALONE!
			(kicks the engine started)
		Adios, muchachos!
			(and he rides off across the field)

ON THE OTHERS, watching him...

					BOWLER
		Has he always been like this?

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

the wind whipping against his face, as he rides his Harley at about a 
hundred miles an hour... The languorous sound of an OLD DEAN MARTIN 
SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

MENORY SEQUENCE - DAY - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as a little boy, sitting in the backseat of the family car. It is 
thirty years ago, and Mister Furious is a sweet, very shy, well 
behaved, perfectly normal three year old.  His MOTHER and FATHER sit in 
the front.  Dean Martin is playing on the car radio.  Little Furious 
looks out the window and sees the Mohave Desert going by.  A sign reads 
"Las Vegas, 120 miles".

					MOTHER
				   (to husband)
		Oh this place looks great.

An old sign reads "BAR" as the family car pulls into the parking lot of 
a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere.  They park.

					MOTHER
		Now honey, you just wait in the car.  Mommy and 
		Daddy will be right beck.

They get out, lock the car and head for the bar, leaving the windows 
up.  Little Furious watches them go, never suspecting that his entire 
life is about to change.  He sits quietly in the backseat and plays 
with the little superhero figurines that he's brought with him.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Pow!  Bang!  Wham!

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

as the parents enter.  A very Western motif.  An old Gene Autrey song 
is playing on the juke.  The air conditioning is on.	They're the only 
customers in the place.

					MOTHER
		It's nice and cool in here.

					FATHER
				(as they sit at the bar)
		Barkeep, a couple of cold ones.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CAR AND BAR -

ANGLE ON THE MIDDAY SON - blazing down on the car...

as Little Furious still plays with his superheroes, but the interior is 
starting to bake, and the sweat begins to pour ofr him.  He looks out 
at the bar. gettinq worried.  He tries the windows, but they're 
automatic and won't open...

Back in the bar his parents down shots of bourbon with their beers, as 
the BARTENDER finishes telling them a joke.

					BARTENDER
		And here's a banana for your monkey.

Mom and Dad have a good laugh.

					BARTENDER
		Couple more?

					FATHER
		You bet.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE TUE CAR as Little Furious, sweat and tears pouring 
out of him, his hair wet and sticking out (and starting to take on that 
familiar look), pounds on the window.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Mommy!  Daddy!  Mommy!  Daddy!

as back in the bar his parents, now very drunk, down more beers and 
chasers as they play a spirited game of pinball.

ANGLE ON THE MOHAVE SUN - beating down mercilessly

barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his 
face a mask of heat and terror... But suddenly, a change begins to take 
place in him, as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in... and his 
fear begins to give way to rage... His teeth bare.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS -

as they CRUSH the superhero figurines in their grasp...

While back in the bar his drunken parents dance a slow two step to Hank 
Williams "Your Cheatin' Heart"...

EXT.  TBE PARKING LOT - NIGHT - HANK WILLIAMS CONTINUES

as the big desert moon shines down on the family car, still parked 
there.

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

The parents are asleep in a booth.  Furious' mother wakes up, looks 
around groggily, and in a moment of horror suddenly remembers...

					MOTHER
		OH MY GOD!

THE PARKING LOT - A BEAT LATER

as she runs toward the car, hysterical.

					MOTHER
		Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!

She unlocks the door, throws it open, and sees something that makes her 
pull back in horror... Little Furious sits in the backseat.  His hair 
sticks out wildly, his face has become that now familiar mask of 
prisordial rage.  Another OLD DEAN MARTIN SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on 
his face; he is still that little boy.  The Dean Martin song is playing 
on the juke.

					MONICA (0.S.)
		Hi.

He looks up and sees Monica.

					FURIOUS
		Hi.

					MONICA
		Alone tonight?

					FURIOUS
		Every night.

She smiles.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Armed Disco Boys guard the front entrance...

While on the hillside above Invisible Boy (looking through binoculars) 
and the Spleen lie together on their bellies in the weeds, keeping the 
mansion under surveillance.

					SPLEEN
				  (in a whisper)
		Adolescence was the worst--The other kids made 
		fun of me, so I'd spit on them and they'd 
		scatter--I've never had a girlfriend--unless 
		you count that night with my cousin--She 
		recovered fully though--We exchange cards every 
		Christmas--Well, I send her one, and she sends 
		it back...
			(spritzes somathing into his mouth,
			then offers it to Invisible Boy)
		Bug repellent?

Suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans... followed 
by a truck, drive out...

POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -

Casanova and Anabel sit in the front of the truck.

					INVISIBLE BOY (0.S.)
		Where are they going?

Invisible Boy hesitates for just a momnt, then gets up and runs down 
the hill.

					SPLEEN
				(runs after him)
		Kid!

As the small convoy drives past, Invisible Boy slips out from behind 
some trees, runs after the truck, jumps up and sits on its rear bumper.  
The Spleen comes running after him, and Invisible Boy reaches out, 
grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him.  Invisible Boy tries the 
rear gate.  It's open. The two of them pull it up just a foot, squirm 
inside, then pull it closed behind them.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Invisible Boy flashes the light of his key chain flashlight around the 
inside of the truck.  There is nothing in it, except for a large pile 
of packing blankets.

EXT.  WATERFRONT AREA - NIGHT

as the convoy drives through Champion City's seedy waterfront area and 
out onto a long pier.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE TV

Dawn Wong and Don Stouffer report the night's news.

					DAWN
		...still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and 
		now, in an unrelated story, another one of 
		Champion City's leading citizens has apparently 
		disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen 
		or heard from in a week. Authorities believe 
		that the hard working superhero may just be 
		taking a well deserved rest.

					DON
		Cancun perhaps?

					DAWN
		Sounds good to me, Don.

Mr. Furious sits in the booth drinking coffee as Monica serves him his 
burger and fries.

					FURIOUS
				   (floundering)
		Monica... I was wondering if--uh-maybe we--I 
		mean you and I--could-uh--you know--get a--I 
		mean have a...

					MONICA
		Date?

					FURIOUS
		Yeah.

					MONICA
		I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me 
		home?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

					MONICA
		That was easy.
				(goes back to work)

ON FURIOUS, feeling a whole lot better.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - UNKNOWN POV

from across the street.  Furious' head is clearly visible in the 
brightly illuminated window of the diner.

A Disco Boy stands in the shadows, gazing at the diner; he recognizes 
Furious.

EXT.  WATERFRONT - NIGHT

The convoy has pulled up alongside a rusty old freighter, docked at the 
pier.

Casanova's men throw the gate of the truck open, and the CAMERA MOVES 
IN.  No one is there, but we notice... two large lumps under the 
packing blankets.

Casanova holds Anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden crate 
being lowered from the deck of the freighter.

					CASANOVA
		Honey, our ship's come in.

Casanova's cellular phone rings.

OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS

The Disco Boy is on his phone.  His pistol is drawn, and he's got it 
aimed right at Furious' head.

					DISCO BOY
		Just give me the word.

BACK TO THE PIER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
				   (gets an idea)
		Wait.  I'll be right there.
				(hangs up, starts off)

					ANABEL
				     (peeved)
		Where are you going?

					CASANOVA
		Head hunting.

A minute later Casanova and two or three Disco Boys drive off in one of 
the sedans... as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is 
pulled closed... and locked.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A MOMENT LATER

The engine starts up, and the truck starts to move, as Invisible Soy 
and the Spleen poke their heads out from under the packing blankets... 
They approach the crate and Invisible Boy shines his flashlight on it.  
The crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands; there's no way 
they're going to be able to get inside it, but in the light of the 
flashlight they see...

Faded red lettering, in Russian, and the distinctive old hammer and 
sickle of the former Soviet Union.

EXT.  DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

Furious walks Monica home.

					MONICA
		I admire you.

					FURIOUS
		Why?

					MONICA
		Being a superhero, wanting to save the world.  
		It's so... unselfish.

					FURIOUS
		It is?

					MONICA
		Most people just want to make money or be 
		famous or something.  But you risk everything, 
		just to help people.

					FURIOUS
				(after a moment)
		I wouldn't mind being famous.

					MONICA
		Who wouldn't?

In the shadows behind them... Casanova follows, stalking them, as 
silent as a vampire.

					MONICA
		I've never been able to figure out what to do 
		with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a 
		waitress.

					FURIOUS
		Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

					MONICA
		What's your real name?

					FURIOUS
		Roy.

					MONICA
		Have you always lived here?

He nods.

					MONICA
		Me too... I love this stupid old town.  It's 
		noisy.  It's smelly. It's falling apart.

					FURIOUS
		It's home.

					MONICA
		Yeah.

CASANOVA'S POV

Monica, smiling, looking lovely.

CLOSE 0N CASANOVA; he wants her...

BACK ON FURIOUS AND MONICA -

					MONICA
		I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or 
		New York, but...

					FURIOUS
		What have they got that we ain't got?

					MONICA
		Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to 
		be here when it does.

					FURIOUS
		Me, too.

					MONICA
		You don't seem very angry right now.

He shrugs.  And they kiss, very tenderly.

					MONICA
		You know what?  Underneath all that anger I 
		think there's just a little boy who wants 
		everyone to love him.

					FURIOUS
		I just want to be a superhero.

					MONICA
		That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

She turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes 
inside, as Furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to. He 
really likes her.  He starts walking back down the street, past a man 
sitting on the stoop.  The man looks up.  It's Casanova Frankenstein.

				CASANOVA
		Going my way?

Furious is caught completely by surprise--he takes a stand, ready to 
fight.

				CASANOVA
		Take it easy--take it easy.  I just want to 
		have a little chat... That was quite a number 
		you did on my car.  You've got a lot of 
		violence in you... and I like that in a guy.

Furious, silent.

					CASANOVA
		You know what the difference is between good 
		and evil, Roy?

Furious reacts to the fact that Casanova knows his real name.

					CASANOVA
		Evil is more fun.  When you want something, you 
		just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, 
		you kill them... You seem like a very 
		frustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled.  
		What is it that you've always wanted, always 
		desired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it 
		to you... Fame?
				(snaps his fingers)
		Easy.  Fortune?  Even easier. Women?
					(laughs)
		The easiest of all.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS as, out of the corner of his eye, he catches movement 
in the alley across the street... he knows what it is.

					CASANOVA
		I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy.  In 
		two days this entire city will belong to me, 
		and there's not a damn thing your little pals 
		can do about it.  It's the perfect time to 
		switch teams... So what do you say?

					FURIOUS
				     (quietly)
		You're nuts.

					CASANOVA
					(flairs)
		They always call the great ones nuts.

					FURIOUS
		And the nuts always call themselves great.

					CASANOVA
				(his psychosis showing)
		Are you with me... or against me?

					FURIOUS
		Against.

					CASANOVA
		Too bad.  PLUG HIM!

Gunfire rings out from the alley as the Disco Bays step out, their 
pistols blazing.  But Furious has anticipated them.  He leaps right at 
Casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of 
fire.

					CASANOVA
		WAIT!

The Disco BQys stop firing... Furious drags Casanova back into an empty 
lot, using him as a shield.

					FURIOUS
				   (to Casanova)
		Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.

					CASANOVA
		You're dead.

					FURIOUS
		So are you!

Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden 
wall at the end of the lot... as the Disco Boys open fire again, and 
their bullets punch holes through the wall...

Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure (that 
we recognize from the model on the TV interview with Casanova earlier.)  
A high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of 
featureless concrete. It looks both totally modern and completely 
ancient, but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully.

ANGLE ON a plaque that reads...  "Frankenstein Center for the 
Performing and Non-performing Arts".

The gates of the center open, and the convoy passes through.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A NONENT LATER

Invisible Boy and the Spleen stand listening, waiting, as they feel the 
truck pull to a stop...

A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with 
several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.

					ANABEL
		Be careful with my baby.

There are two lumps under the packing blankets again.

EXT.  LOADING DOCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The crate is being carried away by a forklift... A beat, and then 
Invisible Boy and the Spleen slip out of the empty truck...

And run down the road back toward the gates... which are still open.  
They're just about to pass safely through them, when a PAIR OF ARMED 
SECURITY GUARDS, step in their path, their guns pointed at thern.

					GUARD 1
		Freeze!

					GUARD 2
		Hands up!

They freeze, their hands held high.

					GUARD 2
		What are you two doing here?

Our heroes are mute.

					GUARD 1
		Not talking, eh?  That can be fixed.  Turn 
		around, start walking up the hill--

					GUARD 2
		And no funny business.

Invisible Boy and the Spleen turn, hands in the air, and start up the 
hill, the guards right behind them.

					SPLEEN
			(after a moment, to Invisible
				Boy, in a whisper)
		Pinch 'em.

Invisible Boy pinches his nostrils--and the Spleen lets out with a 
horrendous fart.  The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as 
our heroes turn and run for it... escaping out the gates.

INT.  DOC KELLER'S LABORATORY/BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Invisible Boy and Spleen report to the others.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia.

The others consider this, then hear a familiar voice.

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Is there room in the pack for one more wolf?

They look up and see that Furious has just returned... The Sphinx moves 
to him.  For a moment they stand face to face...

					FURIOUS
		I was wrong... I need my friends.

Sphinx takes off his mask, revealing that he is the busboy from the 
Tacky Taco.

					SPHINX
		Amigo.

They embrace.

A few mimutes later.  The others are gathered around Furious, listening 
to his story.

					FURIOUS
		Casanova said that in two days the entire city 
		would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing 
		that we could do about it.

					BOWLER
		What did he mean?

					FURIOUS
		I dunno.

Through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside, the 
Frankenstein Center silhouetted ominously against it. Raja, Shoveler, 
and Furious gaze at it.

					SHOVELER
		Maybe it's time we checked that place out.

					RAJA
		But how do we get in?

					FURIOUS
		(after a moment, sounding very Sphinx-like)
		We just become like the wolf... who wears the 
		sheep's clothing.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - THE NEXT DAY

CLASSIC DISCO ("Stayin' Alive" if we can get the rights)

Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes) walk down the street 
together and step into the doorway of... the Salvation Army Thrift 
Shop...

Later.  CLOSE ON three pairs of legs, wearing polyester pants and 
vintage shoes (ala the classic shot from "Saturday Night Fever")... 
CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL our three heroes, dressed in full blown 
seventies attire (with vintage sunglasses), doing their best Travolta 
strut down the street...

MUSIC CONTINUES as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the 
art center, right past the security guards...

OUTSIDE THE CENTER - DAY

They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them... 
then pass through the big wooden doors and into...

INT.  MAIN HALL - A MOMENT LATER

END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall... A 
small army of heavily armed security guards marches about.

					RAJA
		So where's the art?

					FURIOUS
		He hasn't stolen it yet.

					SHOVELER
		This place is built like a fortress.

					FURIOUS
		Because thats what it is.

They hear a WILD BURST OF DRUNKEN LAUGHTER echoing through the hall.

					RAJA
		What's that?

					FURIOUS
				(following the sound)
		Come on.

They approach a doorway.  The noise is coming from within.

INT.  BANQUET IIALL - A MOMENT LATER

as our heroes step inside and see... A big luncheon is in progress.  
Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit at the head table. The room is lined 
with banquet tables, which are filled with VICIOUS LOOKING CHARACTERS, 
drunk, eating, laughing, and giving the waitresses a very rough tim..

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		Oh my God... Every crook in the city is here.

ON A GROUP OF VICIOUS LOOKING BALD BIKER TYPES...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bone Heads from the South Side...

ON THREE INSIPIDLY EVIL LOOKING GUYS in hip suits...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bland Boys from Downtown...

ON A DARK HAIRED WHITE GUY dressed as a rapper...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		Italian Ice...

ON A GUY with a frightening assortment of metal things piercing his 
face...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Stapler...

ON TWO THUGS DRESSED AS ELVIS...

					RAJA (0.S.)
		The Elvis Brothers.

A more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch. Furious 
recognizes one of the waitresses...   It's Monica.

Casanova's got his eye on her, too, and he remembers her from the night 
before on the street with Furious.

ON ANABEL, noticing his interest.

Our heroes see Monica walking straight toward them. They turn away, 
lean against a wail, trying to be totally inconspicuous...

But as she passes them, not noticing them... Casanova approaches her.

					CASANOVA
		Excuse me.

She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet 
away...

					CASANOVA
				(reading her name tag)
		Monica... Beautiful name.  It suits you.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I 
		couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead 
		ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

					MONICA
		Really?

Furious growls.  Raja gives him an elbow.

					CASANOVA
		Are you an actress?

					MONICA
		Just a waitress.

					CASANOVA
		You underestimate yourself.

Mister Furious is fuming.  The strands of his perfectly coiffed disco-
do start to stand straight up.

					CASANOVA
		You know I'm writing a play--it's just a little 
		Broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that I 
		think you'd be perfect for.

					MONICA
		Really?

					CASANOVA
		I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick 
		around after the luncheon?

					MONICA
		Sure--I guess.

					CASANOVA
		Terrific.

She turns and walks into the kitchen.

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, watching her; his intentions are sinister...  He 
turns and sees... our heroes, hanging by the wall.

					CASANOVA
		What are you three doing here? This is invited 
		guests only.  Out.

Our heroes skulk out.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes step out and breathe a sigh of relief.

					RAJA
		That was too close.

					SHOVELER
		But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

					FURIOUS
		Hey.

Furious has spotted... a large covered dessert table, waiting to be 
wheeled into the hall.

BACK IN THE BANQUET HALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the dessert table is wheeled in... and in a CLOSER ANGLE, under the 
table cloth, we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along...

A few minutes later, Monica steps up to the dessert table... Suddenly, 
she is yanked under.

UNDER THE TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over 
her mouth.

					FURIOUS
		It's me.

She calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.

					MONICA
		What are you guys doing here?

				  RAJA & SHOVELER
		Shhhh!

The waitresses leave; the big doors to the dining room are swung 
closed, and the cigars are lit.  The meeting has begun. Casanova takes 
the podium.

					CASANOVA
		Thank you all for coming.  I hope you enjoy the 
		cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get 
		them.

Tony P chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with 
the rest of the crowd.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago, this town was yours!  AND I 
		WAS YOUR KING!

ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad 
old story.

					CASANOVA
				    (tragically)
		But they called me a psycho, and they put me 
		away.  For twenty years I rotted in my cell, 
		painting watercolors, writing haikus--just 
		waiting for the day I could take my revenge.  
		Well, brothers, that day has come!

ON OUR HEROES under the table, listening.  Monica begins to realize 
what's going on.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
		They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on 
		them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on 
		the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest--
		every man, woman, and child in this city is 
		going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC!  Mothers 
		will murder their tots!  Old ladies will 
		strangle their cats!  Children will bump off 
		their babysitters!

The guests think Casanova's completely lost it.  Italian Ice speaks up.

					ITALIAN ICE
		You're outta your mind!

					CASANOVA
		I beg your pardon?

					ITALIAN ICE
		Nobody could drive a whole city crazy.

					CASANOVA
		Tell you what, Ice.  I'll mke you a friendly 
		little wager.  It I can't do it... you can blow 
		my brains out.  If I can, I'll blow out yours.

Now the hoods' interest has been perked.

					ITALIAN ICE
		Done.

					CASANOVA
			(to Anabel, with a smile)
		Honey, give the boys a taste.

Anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors, 
then presses a button on a small remote control device.

ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium... as the air is suddenly 
filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between 
the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear) and 
everyone in the room (except Anabel) goes COMPLETELY BERSERK...

CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, 
gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...

Under the serving table our heroes go crazy...

Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and 
empties it into Italian Ice... who drops to the floor, dead.

Anabel presses the button again; the sound winds down and stops, and 
everything returns to normal.  The entire event lasted only a few 
seconds, but the guests are dazzled.

					CROOKS
		That was great!... What the hell was that?... 
		How did you do that?

Casanova throws Anabel a kiss.

					CASANOVA
		Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be 
		amplified across this entire city.  Murder and 
		mayhem will reign supreme!  And Champion City 
		will be ours again!  This will be our castle!  
		And I will be our king!  And there's no one to 
		stop us!

Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Not so fast, Casanova!

A pair of curtains suddenly part... and Captain Amazing (looking a bit 
singed) is standing there in classic superhero pose.

CAMERA PANS the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to 
terror.  They yank out their pistols, dive for cover under the table, 
throw up their hands in surrender, etc... But Casanova just grins.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, fellas...
			(moves to Captain Amazing, and
		puts his arm chummily around him)
		I killed him... and I've had him stuffed.

Casaova reaches behind Captain Amazing's back and pulls a string (like 
the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls).

					AMAZING
				(in a canned voice)
		Isn't my butt cute in these tights?
				   (pulls again)
		Blue is my color.
				   (pulls again)
		Oh, my abs are killing me!

The crooks are beside themselves with laughter.

ON OUR HEROES, under the table, stunned.

ON THE ELVIS BROTHERS -

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		The King is back!

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Long live the King!

The crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music 
fills the air and Casanova dances, basking in their adoration...

And our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their 
escape...

INT.  DOC HELLER'S BARN/LAB - LATER

Our heroes and Monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

					MONICA
		What could have made such a horrible noise?

					HELLER
			  (after a moment, gravely)
		He's got the Psychostridulator.

					ALL
		The what?

					HELLER
		Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret 
		Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a 
		prototype for a weapon that emitted a 
		fluctuating alternative frequency noise that 
		produced a violent psychotic reaction in any 
		mammal within hearing distance.  But when the 
		old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its 
		brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.

					SHOVELER
		This Kopov, what happened to him?

					HELLER
		Not him... her.

They react to that piece of news, and then the Bowler opens up the 
newspaper.

					BOWLER
		Did she look like that?

CLOSE ON A PHOTO of Anabel and Casanova, announcing their wedding 
engagement.

					HELLER
		Yes.

Silence; this is bad.

					SPLEEN
				    (hopefully)
		Maybe it won't work.

					FURIOUS
		It works.

					HELLER
		A village in Siberia was wiped out when a 
		cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.

Another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.  
For the first time, they're really scared.

					MONICA
		We've got to warn the city.

					SHOVELER
		How?

					RAJA
		No one will believe us.

					BOWLER
		They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

CAMERA CUTS BETWEEN THEM as they look at each other--their frightened 
faces, their sad, faded costuznes.  Even the Sphinx looks scared.

					FURIOUS
			   (after a moment, grimly)
		We know what we gotta do.

They look at him.

					RAJA
		We're outnumbered twenty to one.

					SHOVELER
		It's suicide.

					FURIOUS
		Maybe.  But this isn't about living or dying.  
		It's about good versus evil, and we're good, 
		whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a 
		little funny...

ON THE SPLEEN...

					FURIOUS
		And smell a little funny.  We're not 
		bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're 
		superheroes--and that means doing what's right-
		-even when it's impossible... This is our city-
		-these are our friends, our famlies--and if we 
		don't save them, nobody will!  So I say we take 
		a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, 
		destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach 
		those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

					SPHINX
		Now you're talking.

					BOWLER
		Sounds good to me.

					RAJA
		Let's do it.

					SHOVELER
		And we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!

They're all with him.  Monica steps forward.

					MONICA
		I just want you guys to know--I may not be a 
		superhero, but I'm with you--and I want to 
		help!

					ALL
		Oh that's great... Thanks, Monica...  (Etc.)

					BOWLER
		We could really use some coffee--

					SHOVELER
		And some sandwiches--

					SPLEEN
		With mustard!

					MONICA
			(her feelings a little hurt)
		Sure.

A few minutes later, Monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes 
plan...

					RAJA
		But that place is huge and we don't know where 
		this psycho thing is--

					BOWLER
		Or even what it looks like.

					HELLER
		And he must have it well hidden.

					FURIOUS
		We'll just have to get lucky.

ON MONICA as she gets an idea.  A moment later she slips a canned 
tornado into her purse... as the others put their arms around each 
other in a group huddle\embrace.

					FURIOUS
		Go do what you gotta do.  We'll meet back here 
		at sunset... Do or die.

					ALL
		Do or die.

					SPHINX
		Victoria o morte.

HEROIC MUSIC as...

EXT.  AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - DAY - CLOSE ANGLE ON

THE FRONT GRILL of the Herkimer Battle Jitney... as Mister Furious 
hooks it up to the "Sally's Auto Demolition" tow truck... A moment 
later he drives the tow truck, towing the off the lot, as Sally steps 
out of her office, pissed off...

					SALLY
		HEY!

EXT.  HELLER'S FARM - DAY

ON THE SPHINX, standing as immobile and silent as a statue... as a 
falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him... In a flash, his 
machete slices through the air, and the leaf continues fluttering down, 
but in two pieces...

INT.  LABORATORY/BARN - DAY

Doc Heller fine tunes his Shrinker spray... as the Bowler sits quietly 
in the hayloft, studying the old dog eared photo of her father and 
herself as a little girl...

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Invisible Boy stands in front of his mirror, eyes closed, concentrating 
for all he's worth, trying to become invisible...  He suddenly pops 
opens his eyes and looks at himuself in the mirror... but he's still 
completely visible. He flops onto his bed in frustration.

INT.  THE DINER - DAY

CLOSE ON A TABLE full of food... Eggplant Parmesan, broccoli, chili... 
CAKERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Spleen sitting alone in the booth, 
stuffing his face, gassing up for battle.

INT.  THE SHOVELER'S HOUSE - DAY

The Shoveler, standing in his bedroom, has just put on his freshly 
laundered suit.  CAMERA OPENS WIDE TO REVEAL Lucille, his wife, 
standing there, holding his just polished shovel. He takes it from her, 
then takes her in his arms.

					SHOVELER
		Baby, if I don't make it... find yourself... a 
		normal guy.

					LUCILLE
		I don't want a normal guy.

And they kiss.

A few minutes later... In the living room the Shoveler's kids lie 
sprawled in front of the television.  The Shoveler, in battle array, 
steps into the room.  Be wants to say something to them, but the kids 
don't even take their eyes off the TV look at him... He turns and walks 
out in silence.

END MUSIC...

INT.  THE RAJA'S DINING ROOM - DAY

The shades are drawn.  The Raja, in full costume, quietly loads 
silverware into the secret pockets of his cape. Suddenly, the light 
switches on... It's his mother.  She's caught him red handed.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!

					RAJA
		Mother... it's not what you think!

					MOTHER
		And why are you wearing that silly costume?

					RAJA
				   (painfully)
		Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!

ON HIS MOTHER, shocked.

					RAJA
		Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.  I know how much you 
		wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a 
		family--but it's just not who I am!

					MOTHER
		But... the silverware?

					RAJA
		I use it... to fight evil.

					MOTHER
				(after a moment)
		Jeffrey... this is wonderful.

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		It is?

					MOTHER
		I always knew that you were special.

					RAJA
		You did?

					MOTHER
		Ever since you were a little boy...
			(gets an idea, excited)
		Come with me.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

She pulls down the stairway to the attic...

INT.  THE ATTIC - A MOMENT LATER

She switches on the light and leads the Raja to a far corner...  where 
she moves a couple of old hat boxes, REVEALING an ancient leather bound 
box with the word "Excalibur" engraved in gold on the top.

					MOTHER
		This is for you.

The Raja opens the box and registers astonisha~nt as he sees...

A FABULOUS VICTORIAN SILVER SET packed with formidable looking servers, 
cake knives, ice cream forks.

					MOTHER
		Your Great Great Grandmother's wedding silver.

The Raja lifts up and handles a large heavily engraved pie server.

					RAJA
		Bitchin'.

EXT.  OUTSIDE HELLER'S BARN/LAB - EVENING - CLOSE ON

Mister Furious, wrench in hand, covered with grease and oil, cussing to 
himself as he works under the hood of the Herkimer.

					FURIOUS
		Try it again!

Invisible Boy, sitting behind the wheel, tries the ignition of the 
Herkimer, and the old engine grinds as it turns over, but doesn't 
catch.

					FURIOUS
		Come on, baby... Come on, baby... I SAID COME 
		ON!

Mister Furious SLUGS the engine with his fist, and it sputters and 
backfires into life... shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but 
running... Furious kisses the Herkimer... as the Bowler calls out to 
him from the barn.

					BOWLER
		Mon Capitan, it's for you.
				(tosses him the phone)

					FURIOUS
		Hello?

EXT.  UNKNOWN LOCATION - EVENING - CLOSE ON MONICA

					MONICA
			(on a phone, speaking very softly)
		It's me.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

					FURIOUS
		Monica, where are you?

BACK TO MONICA - WIDER ANGLE

REVEALING that she is on a pay phone just outside the art center.  
She's wearing make-up and a sexy little dress; she looks she's dressed 
for a date.  Disco Boys and security guards go about their business all 
around her.

					MONICA
		At the Frankenstein Center.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM -

					FURIOUS
		Are you nuts?  Get out of there!

					MONICA
		I'm going inside.

					FURIOUS
		What are you talking about?

					MONICA
		Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but 
		he's got a weakness, and I'm it.  Maybe--just 
		maybe--I can trick him into showing me the 
		location of the whatchamathing.

					FURIOUS
		He's a psycho!  He'll kill you!

					MONICA
		Just shut up and listen.  Hold off the attack 
		as long as you can.  If I can discover the 
		location I'll call you--

					FURIOUS
		And what if you get killed?

					MONICA
		Then at least I will have died trying, right?

Furious silent, taken aback by her courage.

					MONICA
		Roy... We might never see each other again, so 
		I'd better tell you now...  I think you're 
		wonderful.

					FURIOUS
			(caught completely off guard)
		What?

					MONICA
		Bye.
				(and she hangs up)

					FURIOUS
		Monica!

INT.  LOBBY OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as Monica approaches a GUARD standing by the main door.

					MONICA
		Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica is 
		here?

					GUARD
		Sure, doll.

BACK TO THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

Furious stands by the Herkimer, phone still in hand.  He seems 
speechless, dazed.  Something inside him has changed.

					BOWLER
				(worried about him)
		Hey... you okay?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Casanova steps out and sees... Monica, looking very sexy.

					MONICA
		Hi.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you'd chickened out on me.

					MONICA
		Just wanted to... powder my nose.

His eyes roam all over her; he knows she's up to something, but she 
looks yummy, and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves.

					MONICA
		How 'bout giving me "the tour"?

					CASANOVA
		Why not?

EXT.  COURTYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as Casanova leads Monica across an open courtyard toward... the sheer 
walls of the imposing central tower.

					CASANOVA
		Big, isn't it?

He leads her to a massive archway, the only apparent entrance to the 
tower.  But just as she is about to pass through, Monica looks up and 
sees something that makes her pull back with fear...

HER POV -

A very sinister looking SECURITY EYE gazes down at her from the top of 
the archway.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry.  It's not activated.

They pass through and into...

INT.  ROOM IN THE BASE OF TOWER - CONTINUOUS

which is filled with IMMENSE BRONZE SCULPTURES of voluptuous, scantily 
clad females in various poses of bondage.  Monica reacts; these things 
are scary.

					MONICA
		Who's the artist?

					CASANOVA
		Me.

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - NIGHT

The Bowler, Spleen, Invisible Boy, and Doc Heller load up the Herkimer 
with Heller's weaponry...

as Mister Furious lies sprawled on the hillside... breathing in the 
night air, contemplating a dandelion gone to seed, and listening to the 
sounds of the night.  The Raja, Shoveler, and Sphinx, stand nearby, 
watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.  A whippoorwill 
is heard singing.

					FURIOUS
		Listen.  He's lonely... and he doesn't care who 
		knows it.

Raja and Shoveler share a bewildered look.  The bird sings again.

					FURIOUS
		We're all the same really.  Our songs, our 
		dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt 
		to live forever.
			(blows the dandelion seeds into the wind)

					SPHINX
		He is in love.  His anger is gone.

					RAJA
		Oh no.

					SHOVELER
		Great timing!
	
					FURIOUS
		Has Monica called?

INT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova leads Monica into... a palatial room, filled with priceless 
objects d'art, all of which reflect Casanova's dark psyche.  A Munch 
painting.  Mayan idols.  Weird German furniture.  A huge glass 
chandelier hovers over the room.  A massive bronze sculpture of a wolf 
(done in the same style as the other sculptures) is perched in the 
balcony.  It seems to be howling out over the city which is seen in a 
spectacular view, spread out alonq the lakeshore below.

					CASANOVA
		This is where I come to... be alone.

He turns down the lights and quietly closes and locks the big door to 
the room.

CLOSE ON MONICA, sensing her danger.

					MONICA
		Oh, look at that view.

She moves out onto the balcony... as Casanova slips the gold chain from 
around his neck and follows her.

INT.  BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes have gathered around Furious, who sits in a chair, getting 
the third degree.

					HELLER
		Snap out of it!

					BOWLER
		Get on to yourself!

					SHOVELER
			(shouting right in his face)
		GET MAD!

					FURIOUS
		But I just don't feel it.

					RAJA
		He's turned into a completely normal person!

					FURIOUS
		Normal.  What's normal?  Does normal exist?  
		And if it did, how would we know it?

The Shoveler slugs him, sending him sprawling.

					FURIOUS
		You know, Eddie, that was really uncalled for.

EXT.  BALCONY ON FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - ON MONICA

gazing out onto the city, as she senses Casanova slinking up behind 
her.

					MONICA
		I'm chilly.

She turns, elegantly avoiding him, and moving back inside.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Spleen holds up Furious' favorite sunglasses.

					SPLEEN
		Look!  Your favorite sunglasses!
				(snaps them in two)

					BOWLER
		Your Roy Rogers coffee mug!
			(hurls it against the wall)

					SHOVELER
		Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
			    (breaks the head off it)

					FURIOUS
		Okay, you win.  I'm pissed off. I'm seriously 
		peeved.

The others groan with frustration.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica moves nervously around the room as Casanova sprawls languorously 
on the bed, toying with his gold chain.

					CASANOVA
		Come here.

					MONICA
		I'm not that kind of girl.

					CASANOVA
		Then why are you here?

					MONICA
		Curiosity.

					CASANOVA
				   (with a smile)
		Remember the cat.

Suddenly, he hears high heels in the hall.  A key is put in the lock--
Casanova leaps off the bed, grabs Monica and roughly shoves her into 
the closet.  He leaps back onto the bed, just as the door opens, and 
Anabel, dressed in a lab coat (and wearing high heels) enters.  
Casanova is completely relaxed, nonchalant.

					ANABEL
		What are you doing all alone in the dark?

					CASANOVA
		Fantasizing... about you.

She crosses the room to the wolf sculpture.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you were done?

					ANABEL
		One last tweak.

She opens a secret panel on its back, REVEALNG a FLASHING HIGH TECH 
INTERIOR... and Monica, watching from the closet, realizes that she has 
found the Psychostridulator.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON

a boom box... A CD jacket tells us that "Kenny G." is playing...

					RAJA
		If this doesn't do it, nothing will!

ON FURIOUS, a pair of headphones on his head.  The music is so loud 
that we can hear it even though it's being played only through the 
headphones.

ON THE OTHERS, gathered around him, waiting to see if this will work.  
And then Furious begins to respond... as his face turns into a 
contorted grimace.

					BOWLER
		It's working!

Furious groans and writhes... The others are thrilled; they've done it!

					FURIOUS
		This music is just SO BEAUTIFUL!

He starts to weep.  The others give a collective groan of defeat.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - COHTINUOUS

as Anabel works on the Psychostridulator, Monica looks at a clock... 
which reads almost eleven.  Time is running out.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CLOSE ON SHOVELER'S WRISTWATCH

which also reads eleven.

0N SHOVELER AND RAJA -

					SHOVELER
		It's time.

					RAJA
		With or without him, we gotta go!

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER -

as Anabel closes up the wolf... and starts to leave.

					ANABEL
		Our guests are waiting.

					CASANOVA
		I'll be down in a jiffy.

She goes out.  Casanova listens as the sound of high heels fades away, 
then he goes to the closet and lets Monica out.

					MONICA
		I'd better go.

					CASANOVA
		You're a spy.

					MONICA
				    (offguard)
		What?

					CASANOVA
		I saw him walk you home.

					MONICA
		Who?

					CASANOVA
		Roy.

She makes a sudden try for the door, but he blocks her way, a cold look 
in his eye that makes her step back in fear.

					CASANOVA
		Don't be afraid... I never hit a lady...

He lets the gold chain drop loose in his hand, then starts coming for 
her, a sadistic grin on his face.  This is the real Casanova.

Monica pulls back, then reaches into her purse and takes out A CANNED 
TORNADO, which she holds out threateningly.

					MONICA
		Stay away!

					CASANOVA
		Or you'll what?  CAN ME?

He laughs dementedly as Monica pops open the can and A SWIRLING FUNNEL 
OF AIR SHOOTS OUT OF IT and ENGULFS Casanova, throwing him across the 
room... Monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the 
door.

ON CASANOVA, pulling himself together.

					CASANOVA
		That bitch!

INT.  CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

as Monica runs for it, dialing the phone on the fly...

INT.  TEE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - ON THE PUONE

ringing... but no one is there...

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are climbing into the Herkimar, whose noisy idling engine 
obliterates the ringing of the phone.

					FURIOUS
		But she still might call!

					SHOVELER
		Are you coming or not?

					FURIOUS
		I'll drive.

					SHOVELER
		Not a chance!

He shoves him in the back, closing the heavy steel door behind him.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON MONICA

hiding behind a large planter... listening to the phone ringing on the 
other end.

					MONICA
		Come on, guys... Pick up... 

Suddenly, we hear Casanova's voice on the line.

				CASANOVA'S VOICE
		What's the matter...

BACK IN THE TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is listening in on another phone.

					CASANOVA
		Nobody home?

BACK TO M0NICA - CONTINUOUS

as she moves quickly down the hall.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is at the wheel.  The Raja sits in the passenger seat.  
The others are in the back.

					SHOVELER
		Here we go!

He forces the stick into gear and the Herkimer lurches forward.

					SHOVELER
		We've got lift off!

					RAJA
		May the forks be with us!

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer--backfiring, smoking, clanging--rumbles down the 
driveway into action.

BACK IN THE HERKINER - CONTINUOUS

Shoveler tries to put the car in second gear, but it won't go. He yanks 
and pulls and struggles, until the stick comes off in his hand.

					RAJA
		First is good.

INT.  CORRIDOR IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova instructs three security guards.

					CASANOVA
		I want her alive.

					GUARDS
		Yes, Mr. Frankenstein.

CAMERA PANS UP the top of a staircase... where Monica is crouched, 
listening.

EXT.  STREETS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS as the Herkimer rumbles and smokes down Champion's main 
street (in first gear) and the citizens step out of houses and bars to 
watch this bizarre sight.

ON A LITTLE BOY AND HIS FATHER -

					LITTLE BOY
		Daddy, what is that thing?

					FATHER
		I don't know, son.

A couple of GRIZZLED CHARACTERS stand in front of a bar.

					DRUNK
		A Herkimer?  Those yuppies will drive anything.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

ON FURIOUS AND THE OTHERS in the back.

					SPHINX
		Amigo, we need you.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Just GET MAD!

Furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.

INT.  V.I.P. LOUNGE IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

A sumptuous, hotel-like lounge.  Anabel is holding court with all of 
top crooks from the luncheon, charrning the pants off them... Casanova 
slithers up behind her.

					CASANOVA
		Fellas, this is woman without whom I would have 
		gone sane.
				(kisses her neck)

EXT.  FRONT GATE OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

A pair of security guards (the same two who got gassed by the Spleen) 
are on duty, when they see... a strange looking vehicle chugging up the 
hill straight for them.

					GUARD 1
		What the hell is that?

					GUARD 2
		Looks like... a Ford Dumpster.

They have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to 
stop...  But the Herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates 
and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.

					GUARDS
		HEY!

They open fire.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Bullets are heard pinging off the Herk as THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD just 
ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art 
center.

					SHOVELER
		Hang on!

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Several more guards open fire, as the Herkimer hits the stairs and 
starts bouncing up them...

BACK AT THE LOUNGE - ON CASANOVA

checking his watch.

					CASANOVA
		It's showtime.

But then they all hear... the sound of gunfire.

					TONY P
		What's that?

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer chugs and bounces... toward the entrance of the center.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes get bounced all over the place.

INT.  JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as guards close and bolt the big wooden doors to the art center.

ON A GUARD wearing a headset.

					GUARD
		Mr. Frankenstein, we're being attacked.

INT.  SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova sits at a security console.  Anabel, Tony P, and the top 
crooks stand behind him, listening.

					CASANOVA
		By whom?

					VOICE OF GUARD
		We don't know!

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer climbs to the top, then rams into the doors with a 
thud.  But the doors hold.

BACK ON THE VILLAINS -

					TONY P
		They'll never get through those doors.

BACK AT THE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

But the plucky little Herkimer digs in its rear wheels and pushes 
against the doors like the Little Engine That Could...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes encourage the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Come on, baby!

					BOWLER
		Do it, big boy!

ON ITS WHEELS, grinding, chewing up the concrete... 

JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer comes crunching through the big wooden doors of the 
center, scattering the guards.

BACK INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

our heroes cheer, pat the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Atta, girl!

					BOWLER
		Atta, boy!

BACK TO CASANOVA -

watching on a security monitor

					VOICE OF GUARD
		Mr. Frankenstein, they're in!

					CASANOVA
		Well kill them.

BACK IN THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

The Herkimer drives into the main hall of the center as a small army of 
security guards swarms in, guns blazing.

BACK AT THE SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and the crooks watch the security monitor...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the Herk as 
our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle...The Sphinxs puts on 
his mask... the Bowler unzips her bag...Doc Heller cocks his air 
cannon... Spleen and Invisible Boy load a bag with canned tornadoes... 
While Mister Furious watches anxiously.

The Shoveler drives intently, bullets splattering like bugs on the 
windshield.

					SHOVELER
		Where am I going?

					RAJA
			(pointing to an archway on the
				other side of the hall)
		Through there!

					SHOVELER
		Right.

But suddenly something under the hood blows up; the engine gives a long 
groan, and the Herkimer rolls to a dead stop...

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE HERIKINER - CONTINUOUS

Right in the middle, in the most exposed position of the main hall.  
More guards arrive and open fire... An armored golf cart with a fifty 
caliber machine gun mounted on it comes speeding into the hall, 
blasting the Herk...

Inside, the sound of the big bullets is deafening as Shoveler tries to 
restart the engine.

					SHOVELER
		No good!  She's dead!

ON CASANOVA AND THE CROOKS, watching the monitor and laughing as 
bullets pulverize the Herk.

					TONY P
		Spam in a can!

The crooks laugh.

Butsuddenly, the Herkimer's door is thrown open, revealing our heroes--
holding down Doc Heller, his air cannon at the ready. He fires--there 
is a WHOOMPH of air--and the mounted gun and a dozen guards are sent 
tumbling...

SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA AND THE OTHERS

watching, sobered.

BACK IN THE MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes come charging out of the Herkimer, using their various 
skills to blow through the surprised guards.  Mr. Furious comes out 
last, not quite sure what to do with himself.

But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid 
down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony 
overlooking the floor.  Bullets splatter all around them--and several 
unlucky guards are hit--but our heroes dive for cover. The Raja tries 
to get off a fork, but the firing is too intense.  Our heroes are 
pinned down.

ON MR. FURIOUS as he sees... the bag of canned tornadoes. He's got no 
superpowers, and he's scared to death, but he grabs a canned tornado.

					FURIOUS
		Cover me!

					SHOVELER
		With what?

Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but 
impressive) zig-zag pattern across the floor... He performs a wild 
somersault, comes up on his feet, pops open the can, and executes a 
perfect jump shot, lobbing it right into the balcony.  The tornado 
funnels out, and the guards are sent flying.

ON CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS watching...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
		Who are those guys?

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, who knows who they are.

WHILE BACK IN THE HALL our heroes rally around a shaken Mr. Furious.

					RAJA
		Not bad for a normal guy!

					SPHINX
		Amigos!

					ALL
		Do or die!

EXT.  COURTYARD - A MOMENT LATER - ANGLE ON

the security eye watching...

as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

as he types something into the security computer...

ON THE SCREEN a computerized image of the eye appears. Casanova 
highlights the word "Activate" and then presses "Enter".

BACK TO THE COURTYARD - ON THE EYE

as it comes to glowing, sinister life...

A hapless guard retreats under the arch--the Eye instantly focuses on 
him, and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams... that SIZZLE 
HIM...

A moment later our heroes arrive at the arch.  Furious is about to run 
through, but Doc Heller holds him back.

					HELLER
		Wait!  Look!

He points to... a man shaped pile of charcoal, all that remains of the 
unfortunate guard.

					HELLER
		Laser eye... and it's a humdinger.

					RAJA
		No problem.

The Raja takes out a butter knife, aims, and hurls it straight at the 
eye, but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into... 
a formless blob of silver.

BACK TO CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS -

					TONY P
		We'll take care of these clowns.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Piece a cake.

					BONE HEAD LEADER
		No sweat.

CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

as Tony P, the top crooks, and the Disco Boys march en masse TOWARD THE 
CAMAERA... They are an ugly, formidable looking bunch.

EXT.  COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are blocked by the eye.

					SHOVELER
		Doc, there's got to be a way.

But the Doc is stymied... Suddenly they hear a woman's voice calling 
down to them.

					MONICA'S VOICE
		It's up here!  It's up here!

					FURIOUS
				     (looks up)
		Monica!

EXT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica leans over the edge of the balcony, the wolf sculpture looming 
over her, shouting down at them.

					MONICA
		ROY!  THE PSYCHO THING IS--!

But strong hands suddenly grab her.  It's Casanova.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as high above he hears Monica scream.

BACK TO THE BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova, hand held tightly across Monica's mouth, shouts down 
tauntingly to Furious.

					CASANOVA
		Thanks, Roy!  She's just my type. You can have 
		her back... when I'm done!

BACK T0 FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as he hears Casanova's evil laugh and Monica's scream.  He is desperate 
to find a way up, but the wall is completely sheer. He feels helpless-
frantic, near tears...

FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' 
car, crying, pounding on the windows...

And then... Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up--
and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage. His button has 
finally been pressed.  Be's MAD!  He reaches up as high as he can...

CLOSE ON HIS HAND -

as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall... and he 
pulls himself up.

BACK AT THE TOP 0F THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova throws Monica onto the bed, puts his hands on her throat and 
strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength.

BACK TO FURIOUS -

Fifty feet up and climbing.  He pulls himself up, one hand, then 
another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny 
cracks he can find... as the others gaze up at him.

					HELLER
		He'll never make it.

					BOWLER
		Think positive.

Meanwhile, Invisible Boy stands staring at the security eye, a look of 
fierce determination on his face.  This is his moment.

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(to himself)
		I can do it.

He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates...

ON FURIOUS as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold 
gives way... For a desperate moment, Furious is dangling off the wall 
by the tips of the fingers of one hand. Only his incredible rage keeps 
his fingertips taut.

Suddenly, there is a flash of silver, and a large cake fork embeds in 
the concrete not far from his head.  Furious grabs hold of it, and 
throws a grateful look down to the Raja...

Who salaams up at him...

As Invisible Boy, eyes closed in concentration, walks very slowly, 
hands at his sides, in an almost Egyptian pose... toward the eye... 
which stares down mercilessly, waiting for its next victim...

we notice that Invisible Boy has become... just slightly transparent.

AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles Monica.  Her resistance 
fades.  Her hands fall away.  She is pale, beautiful, almost gone, a 
picture of exquisite death.

					CASANOVA
				   (admiring her)
		Some girls just know how to die.

Suddenly, we hear someone cursing Casanova in Russian. He turns and 
sees... Anabel standing there, pistol in hand.

					ANABEL
		You two timing psychotic bastard.

					CASANOVA
		Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

					ANABEL
				(aiming at his heart)
		Do I?

					CASANOVA
		I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women.  
		It doesn't mean a thing.
				(moving toward her, turning on
				that old Frankenstein Charm)
		Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our 
		night.  It's what we've lied for... cheated 
		for... murdered for.  She's just a plaything, a 
		trifle... You're the only woman who's ever 
		meant anything to me. I adore you.  I worship 
		you.  I want to make you my bride.

She succumbs to his charms, and he gently takes the pistol out of her 
hand.

					CASANOVA
		There's just one thing...
				(with a psychotic smile)
		I don't need you anymore.

A look of terror comes across her face as she sees the murder in his 
eyes.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Darling.  I never hit a lady.

EXT.  ON THE WALL - A MOMENT LATER - ON FURIOUS

still climbing as he hears a scream, looks up... and sees Anabel go 
plummeting past him.

ON OUR HEROES down below.

					BOWLER
		Heads up!

CAMERA HOLDS ON OUR HEROES, wincing as Anabel hits with an ugly thud.

Suddenly they hear Invisible Boy calling to them.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Guys, I did it! I did it!  I'm invisible!

They all turn and see... Invisible Boy, totally visible, but standing 
on the other side of the arch.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Can you see me?

					ALL
		Yes!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Nuts.

					SHOVELER
		Kid, turn that thing off!

Invisible Boy turns and sees... a computer screen built into the wall 
(with the same image of the eye on it that was on Casanova's computer), 
but he doesn't have a clue how to turn it off.  Suddenly, he hears 
running feet, turns and sees...

The top crooks and the Disco Boys rushing towards him through the giant 
sculptures.  He gets an idea... and stands right in front of the 
computer screen.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		HEY! CREEPS!

He makes a face at them--and a dozen guns are instantly fired at him.  
He jumps clear behind a pillar--as the bullets smash into the wall... 
one of them demolishing the computer screen.

CLOSE ON THE EYE -

as it goes dead.

ON INVISIBLE BOY, hiding behind the pillar... realizing he's been shot 
in the shoulder.

BACK ON OUR HEROES -

					SHOVELER
		This is it!  DO OR DIE!

The villains form a line, bristling with pistols... as our heroes, led 
by Sphinx, Shoveler, and Bowler come running through the arch.  The 
threesome go shoulder to shoulder (with our other heroes right behind 
them) as the villains open fire, laying down a deadly fusillade...

ON SHOVELER, BOWLER, AND SPHINX, standing together, deflecting their 
bullets with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... (as they practiced 
with pebbles at the farm)... with the Raja right behind them, hurling 
silverware...

ON THE VILLAINS, rapid firing... but their own bullets ricochet back 
into them, dropping them... They start to fall back.

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is about to finish Monica.

					CASANOVA
		And the light goes out...

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Frankenstein!

Casanova turns and sees... Furious, standing on the balcony.

					CASANOVA
		Roy... What took you so long?

Furious starts at Casanova, who aims Anabel's pistol at him. Furious 
hesitates.

					CASANOVA
		Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.

					FURIOUS
		They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

Furious lunges at Casanova--who gets off a shot before Furious grabs 
the gun out of his hand.  Casanova ducks clear.  Furious tosses the 
pistol away... then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.

					CASANOVA
		Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance?

He turns on his stereo and the sound of DISCO MUSIC fills the air...

INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

Downstairs, the villains have regrouped.

					TONY P
		Let's rush 'em!

They charge en mass at our heroes... who are waiting for them... 
pinching their noses closed, the Spleen bent over at their forefront...

While Casanova dances around Furious like a cat... Furious, fighting 
the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and Casanova neatly 
sidesteps him...

The crooks and Disco Boys fall back, gasping, choking in the noxious 
fumes...

As Casanova attacks...

Advancing shoulder to shoulder, fighting as a team, our heroes wield 
machete, fork, shovel, bowling ball, and canned tornado... forcing the 
villains back...

Casanova comes at Furious relentlessly, kicking and spinning...  and 
Furious gets the worst of it.

Suddenly, a squad of Disco Boys comes charging at our heroes from the 
flank... but Doc Heller turns to face them, shrinker spray held Rambo-
style on his hip.  He lets them have it, blasting them with a DENSE 
BLUE SPRAY...

When the spray clears, the D Boys lie squirming on the floor, prisoners 
in their now child sized disco suits...

					DISCO BOYS
		Help!... Get me out of this!
				        (Etc.)

Upstairs, Casanova pummels Furious...

While, downstairs, the Shoveler dispatches the Elvis Brothers with some 
nifty shovel work... But suddenly, the Bland Boys, pistols blazing, are 
advancing on him, forcing him back against the base of a sculpture.  
But the Raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.

					RAJA (0.S.)
		Gentlemen!

The Bland Boys look up and see... the Raja, both hands filled with 
silverware... which he HURLS...

A beat later the Bland Boys, bristling with forks and grapefruit 
spoons, run screaming through the sculptures... as Tony P, pistol in 
hand, skulks out from behind a sculpture and spots... the Bowler.

Upstairs, Furious goes flying against a wall...

					CASANOVA
		Roy, you're making this too easy.

As Tony P takes a careful bead on the Bowler.

					TONY P
		Say hello to Daddy for me!

He opens fire, but she goes instantly into her ball svinging frenzy... 
He fires, missing--she's too fast to keep a bead on... Finally, his gun 
clicks empty.  She turns and faces him.

					BOWLER
				     (grimly)
		Daddy says hello.

She HURLS the ball at him--like a fiery softball pitch.

BALL'S POV -

going straight for Tony P's SCREAMING head...

ON THE BOWLER, watching--as Tony's scream is cut short by a gruesose 
thud.

Back upstairs Casanova cornmes at Furious again... but Furious ducks 
the kick, pops back up and smashes Casanova with his good arm... 
sending him flying across the room... Casanova recovers.

					CASANOVA
		Let's change the tune.

He reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device (that Anabel 
used at the luncheon).  He presses a button...

ON THE WOLF SCULPTURE as the jaws open, its eyes glow red... and the 
dreadful sound of the Psychostridulator grinds up and FILLS THE NIGHT 
AIR LIKE A SIREN.

Downstairs, the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and the 
villains all go into a full blown psychotic episode... The villains 
start shooting and stabbing each other.

SERIES OF SHOTS - AROUND THE CITY - CONTINUOUS

On Main Street cars slam into each other.  Pedestrians start screaming 
and fightinq... A man and his dog snarl and snap at each other...

The Customers at the Lakeside Diner go insane, hurling plates and 
food...

At the Shoveler's house the kids turn psycho in front of the 
television...

ANGLE ON A TYPICAL SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -

as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be 
heard coming from all the houses...

LONG ANGLE OF CHAMPION CITY -

as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

in full psychotic ecstasy...

					CASANOVA
		WHAT A RUSH!
			(tosses the remote off the balcony)

ON MONICA, still motionless on the bed...

Casanova and Furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a 
contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength... Casanova gets 
his hands around Furious's throat and crushes it... Furious drops to 
his knees, and Casanova thinks he's got him.  But Furious, grimacing 
with rage, looks him right in the eye.

					FURIOUS
				   (raspy voiced)
		Is... that... all you got?

Furious grabs Casanova's wrists... and crushes them.  Casanova howls 
with pain, loses his grip.  Furious slugs him, again and again... then 
he grabs Casanova by the belt, swings him around, and HURLS him into 
the air...

Casanova CRASHES into the huge crystal chandelier--there is an 
explosion of crystal and glass.  Furious averts his eyes as cut glass 
rains down all around him... then he looks up and sees...

Casanova's gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier.  
Casanova kicks and flails... as he is hanged by the neck on his own 
gold chain...

Furious moves to the wolf sculpture.  Be PLUNGES HIS HAND through its 
bronze casing, and RIPS OUT the heart of the Psychostridulator, a 
flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but 
higher pitched and more irritating sound...

Furious HURLS the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a 
thousand pieces...

CLOSE ON ONE OF THE PIECES -

In insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched, even more 
disorienting sound.  This is the very nerve center of the 
Psychostridulator...

Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel...

SILENCE...

Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted... He looks up... at 
Casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...

					FURIOUS
		Nice dancing with you.

SERIES OF SHOTS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished 
crooks... the traumatized reunants of whom run for it. Things also 
return to normal...

On the street...

At the Lakeside Diner...

And at the Shoveler's house...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Furious moves to the bed, where Monica lies motionless and pale...

					FURIOUS
		Monica...

He touches her face, her eyes open, and she looks at him.

					MONICA
		You're beautiful when you're angry.

He takes her tenderly in his arm... as the Raja, the Shoveler and the 
others rush into the room and see... Furious and Monica embracing.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A LITTLE LATER

Police cars and news vans arrive... as our heroes, battered, wounded, 
but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs...

Furious and Monica hold each other up.  Wounded Invisible Boy has his 
arm around the Spleen... while policemen and news people run up the 
stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...

But this time our heroes could care less.  They are superheroes, and 
they don't give a damn who knows it.

INT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

as the Raja opens the door and enters...

					RAJA
		Mama!

She is there, waiting up for him.

					RAJA
		I'm home.

They embrace.

INT. SHOVELER'S DOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

Don Stouffer is reporting.

					DON
		Few details have emerged...

ON THE SHOVELER'S KIDS, on the couch, still rattled by their psychotic 
episode, glued to the TV -

					DON (0.S.)
		...but the Dawn Patrol got this exclusive 
		interview vith two of the suspects.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong interviews the battered, handcuffed Elvis Brothers as they 
are led away...

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		I don't know who those guys were--but I never 
		want to see 'em again.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Especially that big dude with the shovel...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
					 (near tears)
		He was the worst!

ON THE KIDS' COLLECTIVE REACTION as they realize who it was... and then 
they hear the front door open...

In the front hall the Shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his 
back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.

					KIDS
		Dad!... Dad!... You okay?... You hurt?

					SHOVELER
			   (shocked by this welcome)
		I'm okay--I'm all right.

					EDDIE JR.
		Lean on me, Dad.

					LENORE
		I'll hold your shovel, Dad.

They lead him back into the living room, and give him the prime spot on 
the couch.

					BUTCH
		You want a soda, Dad?

					SHOVELER
					(stunned)
		Okay.

He runs to get it as Eddie Jr. slides a footstool under his feet and 
Tracy puts a pillow behind his back.  Roland, the little one, cuddles 
up next to him, puts his arm around him.

					ROLAND
		Nice work. Dad.

					SHOVELER
		Thanks, Roland.

					ROLAND
		You really are a superhero, aren't you?

The Shoveler nods.  A few minutes later... The Shoveler sits on the 
couch, feet up, soda in hand. The television is off. His kids all 
huddled around him, hanging on his every word.

					SHOVELER
		And that's when the engine blew up.

					KIDS
		Whoa...

					BUTCH
		What did you do?

					SHOVELER
		Well...

ON LUCILLE as she comes in and sees... her husband surrounded by his 
kids, a happy man at last.

EXT.  LAKESIDE DINER - THE NEXT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

INT. THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - ON THE SPLEEN

sitting between the Bowler and a bandaged Invisible Boy. The Bowler has 
her arm chummily around the Spleen's shoulder. The Spleen finally has 
real friends. Doc Heller discusses the art of fork throwing with the 
Raja as the Shoveler listens in. The Sphinx sits at the end of the 
table, silent.

					DOC HELLER
		So you're never actually conscious of range or 
		trajectory?

					RAJA
		Heck no.  I just chuck 'em.

Monica (in her waitress outfit) sits close to a bandaged Mister 
Furious.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong reports.

					DAWN
		It's been twenty-four hours since the deadly 
		psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that 
		left Casanova Frankenstein and dozen of the 
		city's top hoodlums dead... But tonight the 
		question remains... Who were these heroic 
		mystery men who saved our city?...

ON OUR HEROES -

					BOWLER
		Could have been anybody.

They laugh.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute... That's it.  That's our name.  
		We're... the Mystery Men.

They all like it, except for the Bowler.

					BOWLER
		Hey, do I look like a Man?

					SHOVELER
		Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

					SPLEEN
			(singing, ala "Macho Man")
		Mystery, Mystery Man... I want to be a Mystery 
		Man...

		  		  SHOVELER & RAJA
		Shut up.

					BOWLER
		Eat your mustard.

					FURIOUS
		It doesn't matter what we call ourselves.  We 
		know who we are.

					RAJA
		Yes, Obie-wan.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Hey... he's gone.

The others see... that the Sphinx's chair is empty.  Raja spots a 
crumpled napkin on the table, opens it up, and reads.

					RAJA
		"Until you need me again... Adios."

A silence... Reactions from our heroes as they realize that the Sphinx 
is gone...

					SHOVELER
		I miss him already.

Suddenly, somewhere in the night, a burst of gunfire and screams are 
heard.  THE FINAL MUSIC BEGINS...

					FURIOUS
		Amigos, duty calls.

The Mystery Men wolf their burgers, then stand and start for the 
street...

As Monica watches them leave, a PATRON asks her:

					PATRON
		Miss... who are those guys?

					MONICA
				(after a moment)
		I don't know.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - A MOMENT LATER

HEROIC GROUP SHOT as the Mystery Men merch down the middle of street, 
toward the sound of the gunfire... and into the night.

THE END
THE MYSTERY MEN

By Neil Cuthbert

Based on the Dark Horse comic created by Bob Burden

Revised June 6, 1997



THEME AND CREDITS...

FADE IN:

EXT.  ERIE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING 
INTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by 
towers and gun turrets.  Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from 
within...

CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" 
... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

THE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as 
CASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them.  Dressed in an 
immaculately tailored prison smock (with "Casanova" exquisitely 
embroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET 
BIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.

					BIERCE
		No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. 
		Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years 
		he has been with us, I have never seen a 
		patient turn his energies to more productive 
		use.

CASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.

					BIERCE
		Just look at his accomplishments... three 
		volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture 
		garden, four romance novels... and who can 
		forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow 
		in our all-psychotic production of 
		"Carousel"...

ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that 
brilliant performance...

					BIERCE
		Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.

ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top 
shrink.

A moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming, 
sincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion.  He is a master of 
seduction.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago I was a lost soul.  
		Loveless...
		(with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce)
		Fatherless...
		(chokes on the word)
		A... psycho!
		(breaks down sobbing)
		Oh!  How could I have done it? The murder... 
		the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls!
		(weeping, a brilliant performance)
		I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!

Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.  Reactions from the board, 
moved, as Casanova weeps convulsively.  Doctor Leek shows no reaction.

					CASANOVA
				(pulls himself together)
		But my deeds have been done, and my youth is 
		gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel 
		world... and if I have learned anything from my 
		wretched life it is that... When you walk 
		through a storm, keep your head held high...
					(singing)
		And don't be afraid of the dark...

Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY 
ORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF "WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM" SWELL...

SERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES

A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"... Casanova shakes hands and 
embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a 
paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.

In his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit 
(that's been waiting far him for twenty years).

Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the 
lock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the 
hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an 
office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board 
stand watching, very proud...

But suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari 
drives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the 
review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a 
nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...

Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up 
at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck... 
Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get 
in the car.

INT.   THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Casanova and Anabel drive off.  The massive old hospital is seen 
through the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his 
watch...

CLOSE ON HIS WATCH -

as the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  It is exactly twelve 
noon...

BACK ON CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
				(almost wistfully)
		Boom.

And the hospital EXPLODES in a HUGE FIREBALL that completely consumes 
it.

					CASANOVA
		Those gas leaks can be murder.

EXT.  THE ROAD - DAY

The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads 
"We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing". The city itself, a 
crumbling rust belt metropolis (ala Detroit) can be seen stretched out 
along the shore of Lake Champion off in the distance...

INSIDE THE CAR - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
		I'm home.

BACK ON THE ROAD  - CONTINUOUS

The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the 
road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed 
classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.  The caption reads 
"Crime.  Don't even think about it."

EXT.  TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

Letters read "Six months later"...

as the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, 
CRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars...

CAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then 
pulls up beside an old boxcar.  The back of the van is thrown open, a 
ramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time 
thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading 
their night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down 
the ramp.

					RED EYE 1
		Golf anyone?

Several more Red Eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes 
still attached, a barber pole, a Virgin Mary lawn statue, and a top of 
the line baby stroller... while their leader, BIG RED, stands in the 
door to the boxcar, watching approvingly.

					RED EYE 2
		Not a bad night's work.

					BIG RED
		Who said crime don't pay?

The Red Eyes laugh... as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby 
stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.

					RED EYE 3
		Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway.

The crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs 
at them.

					RED EYE 4
				(about to slug him)
		Who you laughin' at, punk?

					RED EYE 2
		He's just a tyke.  Lighten up.

					RED EYE 5
		He's kinda cute.

					RED EYE 3
		If you like drool.

					RED EYE 2
		Hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents?  
		For a million bucks!

The others think that's a great idea, but Big Red doesn't.

					BIG RED
		And what if he rats on us?

The others hadn't thought of that.

					RED EYE 3
		So what should we do with him?

					BIG RED
		Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in 
		the lake.

The others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.

					RED EYE 3
		Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.

But suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and 
cape with the initials "BR" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE 
RAJA.

					RAJA
		Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term 
		loosely... Unhand that youngster...

Another man steps into the light.  He wears a construction helmet and 
mask.  There is an "S" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel.  He 
is THE SHOVELER.

					SHOVELER
		Or you're mulch.

He brandishes his shovel for effect.  The Red Eyes look at these two, 
highly amused.

					BIG RED
		What are you guys supposed to be... 
		superheroes?

A third man steps out.  His costume is less dramatic than the others.  
He wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames 
on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his 
haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous 
of the three.  He is MISTER FURIOUS.

					FURIOUS
		We ARE superheroes!

					BIG RED
		Really?  Did you mother make those costumes?

The crooks howl with laughter.

					BIG RED
		This is our territory.  Beat it.

					FURIOUS
		Over YOUR dead body.

Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.

					BIG RED
		0ooooo, he's scary.

The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes 
through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.  He howls 
with pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.

					BIG RED
		A fork!

The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver 
forks.

					RAJA
		And there's plenty more where that came from.

Big Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of 
an old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth.  He 
is eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, 
taking huge bites out of it, container and all.

RAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp.  This was more than they'd 
bargained for.  But Furious just growls; he's game.

					BIG RED
		GET 'EM!

The Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his 
hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming 
crooks...

A Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his 
shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan.  The crook yelps with 
pain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks, 
poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, 
watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.  (There's no real 
martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley 
brouhaha.)

But there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging 
fists... and so does the Shoveler...

Furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and 
rights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of 
him and crushing him under his massive weight.

					RED EYES
		Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!

					FURIOUS
			(barely audible under all that meat)
		Is that all you got?

					RED EYES
		He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him 
		off!

					FURIOUS
					(faintly)
		Your mother!

Mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative 
voice is heard.

					VOICE (0.S.)
		Is there a problem?

Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN 
AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the 
light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique 
sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting 
heroically in the wind.  He is superhero perfection incarnate.

ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...

					RED EYES
		IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!

Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca-
like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.  As the baby claps his 
hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing 
deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly 
delivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he 
doesn't even break a sweat.

The remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in 
surrender.

					RED EYES
		We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible 
		childhoods!  (Etc.)

Police cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and 
the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and 
reporters...

Our three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh 
as a daisy).

					RAJA
		Nice work, Captain.

But Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they 
didn't even exist.  He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer 
to Connie Chung).

					AMAZING
			(turning on the old superhero charm)
		Hi. Dawn.

					DAWN
			(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)
		Looks like you've done it again, Captain.

					AMAZING
		It's what I do.

Our heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated.  Furious growls.  
Suddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.

					COP 1
		Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand--
		we're superheroes, and we just busted up this 
		gang.

					COP 1
		Really?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and 
		he's...
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Captain Pooper Scooper!

The cops crack up.  Furious growls at them.  The cops yank out their 
nightsticks.

					COP 1
		Hey!  Move it!

					COP 2
		Get a life!

					COP 1
		And leave crime fighting to the real thing!

Shoveler and Raja pull Furious away before he gets into real trouble... 
The cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.

					COP 1
		Wannabes.

					COP 2
		Pathetic.

EXT.  THE LAKESIDE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

An inner city greasy spoon.

INT.  THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

on which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being 
interviewed by Dawn Wong.  He's playing the cutsy photo op for all its 
worth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc.  Dawn is creaming.

Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the 
tube...

					RAJA
				(nursing a sore jaw)
		He doesn't miss a trick, does he?

					FURIOUS
		What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!

					SHOVELER
		Oh don't start that again--

					FURIOUS
		LOOK!

Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good 
looking guy in a tux at a benefit... The headline reads "Lance Hunt 
Hosts Benefit."  He holds the picture up next to the television, so the 
faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.  It is 
obviously the same guy.

					FURIOUS
		He's Lance Hunt!  Just take off the glasses--
		and it's him!

					RAJA
		There's a vague similarity.

					FURIOUS
		A vague similarity?  IT'S THE SAME GUY!

					SHOVELER
				(downing some aspirin)
		0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take 
		this anymore.  Night after night we're on the 
		streets, busting our humps--and for what?

					RAJA
		We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

					SHOVELER
		How long do you have to chase a dream before 
		you realize it's not gonna happen?

					FURIOUS
		We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever 
		heard of him until he busted Casanova 
		Frankenstein!

					RAJA
		But look at him... and look at us.

					SHOVELER
		The camera loves him.

A depressed silence.  Furious turns his attention to the napkin 
dispenser.

					FURIOUS
				     (furious)
		Why do they always fill stuff these things so 
		full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 
		'em!
				   (rips one out)

					RAJA
		I lost another fork tonight.  She's getting 
		suspicious, I know it.

					FURIOUS
		So why don't you just tell her!

					RAJA
		I can't.

					FURIOUS
		Why not?

					RAJA
				     (upset)
		Because I can't!  Okay?  She wouldn't 
		understand!

					SHOVELER
		Leave him alone.  She's his mother, not yours.

					FURIOUS
		We had an off night, that's all.

					SHOVELER
		So when are we gonna have an on night?

A WAITRESS is standing at the table.

					WAITRESS
		Hi.

They look at her, taken aback.  She's very pretty.

					RAJA
		You're... new.

					WAITRESS
		It's my first night.  My name's Monica.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her.  
Under all that rage, he's in fact shy.

					MONICA
		You guys going to a costume party?

					RAJA
		We're superheroes.

					MONICA
		Really?  Like Captain Amazing?

Furious growls.

					MONICA
		Are you famous?

					RAJA
		Not yet.

					MONICA
		So you're like... struggling superheroes?

					RAJA
		We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I 
		am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...
				(does a very impressive
				little flipping thing with
				his place setting)

					MONICA
		Wow.

					RAJA
		And these are my associatiates, the Shoveler.
	
					SHOVELER
		Hi.

					RAJA
		And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.

					MONICA
				(intrigued by Furious)
		Really?

					RAJA
		Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or 
		a great skill.  In his case, it's entirely 
		emotional.

					MONICA
		So what can I get you?

					RAJA
		Burgers all around.
				(meaning himself)
		Medium.
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Rare.
				(meaning Furious}
		Raw.

A moment later as Monica walks away, Furious can't help but
watch her.  The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good 
stuff from his coat.

					RAJA
		She likes you.

					SHOVELER
		Definitely.

					RAJA
		Ask her out.

					FURIOUS
		Nah.

					RAJA
		Roy, when was the last time you had an actual 
		date?

					FURIOUS
				(getting very pissed off)
		What does it matter?  Women just want to 
		control you--and talk about their feelings.  
		They want to know why you're angry all the 
		time--and what can they can do to help--so you 
		tell them there's nothing--nothing--just leave 
		me alone--but they bug you and they bug you and 
		they bug you--until you just can't stand it 
		anymore!--so you finally open up--you pop like 
		a blister--and it all comes spewing out--all 
		your emotions--your feelings--your fears--all 
		of it!
					(after a beat)
		And then they dump you.

					RAJA
		So you're chicken?

					FURIOUS
				     (fiercely)
		Who's chicken?
					(gets up)

Monica stands at the counter placing her order.  Furious approaches 
her, leans against the counter.  For a moment he just stands there, 
fuming, unable to think of anything to say. She isn't sure what to make 
of this.

					FURIOUS
		Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you 
		really want to talk to somebody you can't think 
		of anything to say!

					MONICA
		I guess... Are you always so angry?

					FURIOUS
		Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?

She shrugs.

					FURIOUS
		Want to go out and get drunk?

She's visibly turned off by that.

					FURIOUS
		Or talk?

					MONICA
		Not tonight.
			(picks up an order and walks away)

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE DINER - LATER

Furious, the Raja, and the Shoveler step out.

					RAJA
		Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

					FURIOUS
			(gets on his old Harley)
		Like what?  Cutting off my own ear?

					RAJA
		Or flowers.

					FURIOUS
		See ya tomorrow.

Furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the 
Shoveler opens the door of his battered Ford Esquire station wagon, and 
the Raja gets into his ancient Datsun.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The Shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house. The 
front yard looks like a battle zone.  Bikes and kids' junk are 
everywhere.

LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

as big a disaster area as the front yard. His kids, EDDIE JR. (15), 
LENORE (12), BUTCH (10), TRACY (7), and ROLAND (5) are all sprawled in 
front of the television. The Shoveler enters, and his kids don't even 
bother to look up from the tube.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place 
		up?

					TRACY
		When you're on TV.

					EDDIE JR.
		Right--like that will ever happen.

					LENORE
		Save any babies lately?

ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.

					TRACY
		Faster than a speeding turtle--

					BUTCH
		More powerful than a deodorant--

					EDDIE JR.
		Able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting--

					LENORE
		Look, snoring in his chair--

					EDDIE JR.
		Sitting on the john--

					ALL
		It's... Supergut!

The kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well) as the 
Shoveler dejectedly walks into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

The Shoveler enters, dejected.  His wife, Lucille, is doing the dishes.  
She looks up, sees him.

					LUCILLE
				  (feels for him)
		Rough night, Eddie?

He nods.

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

The Raja's Datsun is parked in front of a neat as a pin little 
Victorian house.

INT.  THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark.  Someone is sneaking around.  A drawer is quietly 
opened, and we hear the gentle clink of silver. Suddenly, the light 
goes on and we see the Blue Raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and 
slacks, with his hand in the drawer.  His MOTHER, in her nightclothes, 
stands by the door where she has just switched on the light.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey!

					RAJA
		Oh hi, Mom.

					MOTHER
		What are you doing in the silver drawer?

					RAJA
		Looking for... the TV Guide.

She just looks at him, very suspicious.

					MOTHER
		It's on the television.

					RAJA
		Of course.  I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.  
		Go to bed.

He kisses her and goes into the next room.  CAMERA HOLDS ON MOM; she 
doesn't trust him.

EXT.  HILLTOP - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

A billboard overlooking the city.  Captain Amazing is posed wearing a 
pair of bright blue Nikes.  The caption reads. "It's a nice world.  
Sonebody's got to save it... The Nike Supershoe.  It's Amazing."

Furious sits on his Harley, taking long hauls from a pint bottle of 
cheap bourbon and gazing up at the sign.

					FURIOUS
		Amazing?  What's so amazing about him?  I'd be 
		amazing, too, if I'd inherited two hundred 
		million bucks... or two bucks... or two 
		cents...
			(hurls the empty bottle, smashing
				it against the sign)
		Who am I kidding?  Dreams don't come true.

A moment of despondency, and then he hears a strange sound overhead and 
looks up...

HIS POV -

as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above 
him...

It is Captain Amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...


					FURIOUS
		Where's he going?
			(kicks his Harley started)

SERIES OF SHOTS - WITH MUSIC

as Furious, following Captain Amazing, rides roughshod down the steep 
hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential 
area...

He cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and 
rides smoothly along it, following Amazing... He turns off the tracks, 
rides roughly through some woods, then emerges from the trees and 
sees..

A foreboding looking old mansion... Captain Amazing lands on the 
highest part of its roof... Furious pulls up, gazes at the front gates 
of the mansion...

HIS POV -

Letters across the iron gates read... "Frankenstein".

EXT.  ON THE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Captain Amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate 
roof like Spiderman, leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking 
along a high ridge like a tight rope walker. Finally he approaches a 
skylight, looks down and sees...

A huge old library with an iron catwalk running around it. Casanova 
Frankenstein sits in a club chair by a roaring tire. Anabel perches on 
the arm of his chair.  In the other chair sits a once good looking, now 
paunchy guy, with a meticulously coiffed haircut.  He is TONY 
POMPADOUR, head of the infamous Disco Boys.

0N CAPTAIN AMAZING

					AMAZING
				(just as he suspected)
		Uh-huh.

He sees that the skylight is open, and quietly lets himself in...

INT.  THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Tony P savor glasses of brandy and puff on big cigars.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you enjoy these cigars.  I had to kill a 
		dozen Cubans to get them.

					TONY P
		Ummm.

					CASANOVA
		Have you considered my offer?

					TONY P
		You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved 
		workin' for you.  You had such style: the 
		clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd 
		snuff a babe.  You were the King...

Casanova accepts this graciously.

					TONY P
		But times have changed, and you been in that 
		bug house a long tine. I can see you still got 
		the style, but I dunno for sure you still got 
		the edge.

					CASANOVA
		I got it.

					TONY P
		What about Captain Amazing?

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Good question.

Casanova and Tony P look up and see Captain Amazing, posed noncalantly 
on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.  Tony P jumps out of his 
chair, scared.  But Casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as 
a cucumber.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd cone.  I left that skylight open 
		for you.

					AMAZING
		I know you did.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd know.

					AMAZING
		I know you knew I'd know.

					CASANOVA
		But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?

					AMAZING
		Of course.

Tony P makes a move for his pistol, but Captain Amazing instantly whips 
out his pistol, getting the drop on him.

					AMAZING
		I'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of 
		scum like you, Tony.

Tony freezes.

					AMAZING
		The jig is up, Casanova.  I've spent six months 
		watching you, and know exactly what you're up 
		to.

					CASANOVA
		Really?

					AMAZING
		I know that you're recruiting your old 
		henchmen...

Nervous reaction from Tony P.

					AMAZING
		I know who your girlfriend really is...

Icy reaction from Anabel.

					AMAZING
		And I know the terrible revenge that you plan 
		to inflict on this city.

					CASANOVA
		I guess you know just about everything, don't 
		you, Lance?

					AMAZING
		Um-hmm.

					CASANOVA
		Except for one little thing.

					AMAZING
				(supremely confident)
		And what's that?

					CASANOVA
		That I've hot wired the city's entire power 
		supply through that catwalk.

					AMAZING
		What--?

Casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch, and the ugly hum of a 
million volts instantly fills the room...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - ON FURIOUS

still watching... as all the lights in the house go out, except for a 
frightening orange glow in an upper room...

Off in the distance Furious sees... the lights of the entire city 
flicker and then black out... A moment later the mansion, and the 
city's lights return to normal... as Furious watches, not sure what to 
make of this.

EXT. STREET CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Traffic is snarled.  Horns are blasting.  Tempers are frayed.

CLOSE ON A HAMMERING JACKHAMMER... CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL that it is 
being operated by the Shoveler, dressed in work clothes.  Wiped out 
from the night before, the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off 
to sleep... He nods out... as his BOSS whacks him on the arm.

					BOSS
		YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX!  Get your shut-eye at 
		home, or you'll be a full time superhero!

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT.  THE RAJA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as 
he watches... an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.

					ANTHONY
		It's all within your power.  The only thing 
		that's in your way is YOU!

					RAJA
		Easy for you to say.

EXT.  SALLY'S AUTO DEMOLITION - DAY - ESTABLISHING

An auto junkyard and demotion yard.

EXT.  THE YARD - DAY

A giant press mashes an old car... while nearby Mister Furious does the 
job by hand, demolishing an old Grand Prix with an iron bar.  He does 
it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping 
off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing 
the pieces onto a big pile... His big boned, red faced boss SALLY is 
calling out to him.

					SALLY
		Hey, Roy!

EXT.  THE BACK OF THE YARD - A MINUTE LATER

In a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard Sally and Furious stand 
looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle. It is a Herkimer Battle 
Jitney, a heavily armored, windowless, soundproof, personnel carrier 
(designed by the Pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on 
battlefield fact finding tours).  Overgrown with weeds, home to an 
extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are 
over.

					SALLY
		How many times I gotta tell you about this?

					FURIOUS
		Sally, that's a Herkimer Battle Jitney!  They 
		don't make 'em like that anymore.  It's a 
		classic!

					SALLY
		It's a hunk of junk.  I want the iron.  Do it!

She walks away.  Furious growls.  He picks up his iron bar and is about 
to wedge it under the front bumper of the Herkimer...

HIS POV -

But the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at 
hint, imploring him for one last chance...

And he just can't do it.  He throws away his iron bar and climbs inside 
the cab of the Herkimer...

IN THE CAB - CONTINUOUS

Furious sits behind the wheel and tenderly touches its beat-up old 
dashboard, then turns on the radio, which, miraculously still works.  
He tunes in a local station, puts his feet up on the dash.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		...and continues to deny any knowledge of the 
		incident... In local news, millionaire Lance 
		Hunt has apparently disappeared...

ON FURIOUS, taking immediate notice.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		Members at his household told police that the 
		playboy philanthropist failed to return home 
		last night after "going out for a walk".  
		Police say they have no reason yet to suspect 
		foul play, but a search is under way...

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Furious, the Shoveler, and the Raja all sit at their booth.

					FURIOUS
		I saw him go in--and he didn't come out!
	
					RAJA
		But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

Furious groans.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, look.

ON THE TV -

Casanova is being interviewed by DON STOUFFER, the local Mike Wallace.

					CASANOVA
		Well, Don, I've done some terrible things in my 
		life, but now I'm cured, and I just want to 
		give back something to my old home town... 
		That's why I'm using what's left of my fortune 
		to build...

CLOSE ON A MODEL of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure 
(i.e.  the Getty)

					CASANOVA (O.S.)
		The Frankenstein Center for the Arts.

					DON
		You've changed, haven't you?

		CASANOVA
		Oh yes.

BACK ON FURIOUS, RAJA, and SHOVELER - 

					FURIOUS
		No he hasn't.

EXT.  FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

the wall of the estate... as our heroes' three heads rise up over  
it... and survey the grounds.

					FURIOUS
				(about to climb over)
		Let's go.

					RAJA
			(in a whisper, holding him back)
		Wait!... Look!

THEIR POV -

A group of men are hanging around the door to the house, smoking, 
chatting, and laughing.  A CLOSER ANGLE REVEALS that they are all 
dressed in the height (or depths) of seventies disco fashion.  One of 
them is showing off some steps.

Our heroes fall back behind the safety of the wall and confer.


					RAJA
		This is bad.

					SHOVELER
		Who are they?

					RAJA
		The Disco Boys.


					FURIOUS
		The who?

					RAJA
		The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever 
		produced.  Twenty years ago they were 
		Casanova's personal bodyguard.  But after he 
		was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

					FURIOUS
		Well they've crawled back out.

					SHOVELER
		We may be getting in over our heads here.

					RAJA
		This looks like a job for Superman--

					SHOVELER
		Or Batman--

					RAJA
		Or both.

					FURIOUS
		Don't you guys get it?  If Captain Amazing is 
		still in there, we can rescue him--and get on 
		TV!
			   (goes right over the wall)

They share an exasperated look, then scramble over the wall after him.

INT.  CASANOVA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Dr. Anabel Leek are preparing for bed.  Anabel sits in 
front of a huge mirror, brushing her long hair as Casanova moves up 
behind her and puts his hands around her throat, massaging, squeezing, 
just barely resisting the temptation to strangle her.  (She loves it).

					CASANOVA
		Everything's going exactly as we planned.

					ANABEL
			(puts the sharp point of her
			comb handle under his chin)
		Not quite.  You haven't announced our 
		engagement yet.

					CASANOVA
		It must have slipped my mind.

					ANABEL
		Your mind is so slippery.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Pootchkie.  My womanizing days are 
		over.  You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my 
		Nicole.
				(pulls her into his arms)
		We're such an incredible team.  Who could 
		possibly stop us?
		(kisses her)

CUT RIGHT TO:

EXT.  THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS - ON OUR THREE HEROES

as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard.

					RAJA
		Don't crunch the leaves.

					SHOVELER
		Sorry.

					RAJA
		Be a Mohican.
	    		   (bumps into a lawn chair)

					FURIOUS
		Wait.
				(They all stop.)
		I hear something.

They all listen; there is a low rushing sound... It is the sound of 
water rushing through pipes.  Suddenly, the lawn sprinklers all pop 
up... and our heroes get drenched.  They duck off the lawn, behind the 
cover of a large tree.

					RAJA
		I'm soaked.
				    (sneezes)
		Oh great.

					FURIOUS
		Shhh.

					SHOVELER
		Be a Mohican. 

					RAJA
		Shut up.

Furious sees a pair of French doors, off a small patio.  One of the 
doors is slightiy open.

					FURIOUS
		Come on.

They start sneaking toward it, but as they cross the patio... they trip 
the automatic security lighting, and suddenly find themselves bathed in 
light.

					RAJA
		Uh-oh.

As our heroes look around as a dozen Disco Boys, armed with pipes, 
chains, brass knuckles, step into the light and encircle them... The 
French doors open and Tony P steps out.

					RAJA
		Oh I'm sorry.  We must have the wrong house.

					TONY P
		You sure do.

The Disco Boys attack.  The Raja is instantly clubbed down. The 
Shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes 
down, too... These guys are not the Red Eyes.

Only Furious holds his own.  He grabs a pipe away from one of them and 
swings fiercely, keeping the others off.  Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull 
back.  Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...

Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.

					CASANOVA
		Hi there.

With a cat-like move Casanova slashes his gold chain viciously--and 
repeatedly--across Furious' face.  Furious, stunned with pain, lunges 
at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast 
combination of spinning disco kicks.  Finally he lassos the chain 
around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.

ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...

Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground.  Casanova steps 
away, and the Disco Boys gather around Furious and kick him 
viciously... as Casanova and Tony P watch, amused, chuckling.

					CASANOVA
		Superheroes.

					TONY P
		Should I kill them?

					CASANOVA
				(completely disdainful)
		Why bother?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE MANSION - A MOMENT LATER

The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like 
bags of garbage into the street... where thay lie in a moaning, 
agonized, semi-conscious heap.

INT.  THE DINER - LATER - CLOSE ON

Furious, rubbing his neck; a thin red mark runs around it. The three of 
them are sitting at their usual table, in very bad shape, moaning and 
groaning... Monica approaches.  She's made them ice packs and cold 
compresses.

					MONICA
		Here you go.
			(sits with them, applies a compress
				to the Raja's head)

					RAJA
		Ow.

					MONICA
		Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero 
		stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

A FUSSY CUSTOMER is calling out from another table.

					FUSSY CUSTORER
		Miss!

She moves off.

					RAJA
		Maybe she's right.

					FURIOUS
				(still furious)
		Are you serious? This is the break we've been 
		waiting for!

					SHOVELER
		What are you talking about?

					FURIOUS
		What have the famous superheroes got that we 
		don't?

					RAJA
		Agents?

					FURIOUS
		Archenemies!  Casanova isn't just a criminal--
		he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our 
		ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!

					SHOVELER
		And it would be the right thing to do.

					FURIOUS
				   (dismissively)
		Yeah yeah--and that, too.

					RAJA
		But there's only three of us, and he's got the 
		entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.

					FURIOUS
		Then maybe it's time for us to form our own 
		brotherhood...
					(more)
	
					FURIOUS (Cont'd)
		a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, 
		skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of 
		the night!

					SHOVELER
		I'm liking this.

					FURIOUS
		I say we send out the word--and summon all of 
		the unsung superheroes we know!

					RAJA
				(after a moment)
		Yeah, but... who do we know?

They take a long moment to ponder this.

					FURIOUS
		Well... there's the Spleen.

Shoveler and Raja make disgusted noises.

					RAJA
		Do we have to?

					SHOVELER
		I got this cousin.  He's a real doofus, but he 
		claims he can become invisible.

					FURIOUS
		Have you ever seen him?

					SHOVELER
		How could I see him if he's invisible?

					FURIOUS 
		Good point.

					RAJA
		And there's the Sphinx.

					SHOVELER
		The who?

					RAJA
		He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting 
		superwrestler and master of the machete.

					FURIOUS
		Sounds good.

					RAJA
		No one's sure that he actually exists, but they 
		say he can be contacted by leaving a message on 
		a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by 
		the bus station.

					SHOVELER
		Get outta here.

EXT.  TACKY TACO - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A funky Mexican restaurant by the bus station.

INT.  THE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes, in normal clothing, have just finished a taco lunch.  
Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.

					FURIOUS
		You sure that's how you spell it?

					SHOVELER
		Yeah.

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Spinks, we need you."

They crumple up the napkin and leave the restaurant... A moment later a 
shy looking MEXICAN MAN busses their tray... but in A CLOSE ANGLE we 
see him secretly pocket the napkin.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A little brick house.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of 
the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc.  
INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister 
Furious, and the Shoveler.

					FURIOUS
		So, let me get this straight.  You have the 
		power to become invisible.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		But... only when no one is looking.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		If someone looks at you, you immediately become 
		visible again.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible... to yourself?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		No.

					OUR HEROES
					(hopefully)
		No?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		If I look at myseif, I become visible.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no 
		one is looking at you?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		So how do you know that you've ever been 
		invisible?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I just know.

Our heroes are less than impressed.

					FURIOUS
		Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to 
		interview--

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(desperate)
		I know I haven't got it entirely worked out 
		yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a 
		superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? 
		Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a 
		chance?

ON OUR HEROES, looking around the room... and softening up.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Our heroes sit at their usual table along with Invisible Boy and a 
weird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit.  Across 
his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and 
that's exactly who he is.  Furious, the Raja, and Shoveler sit as far 
away from him as possible. He is a totally noxious, hyperactive 
person... and he is thrilled to be there.

					SPLEEN
		Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when 
		you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?
				   (sucks it in)
		I've always dreamed of being a member of the a 
		real superhero team--and to have friends--real 
		friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep 
		with--die with--eat with...

He puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into 
his mouth.

					SPLEEN
		I love mustard.

Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've 
actually invited this guy to join their group.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		So what exactly is your superpower?

					SPLEEN
		Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal-
		-remember that?--and my brothers and I used to 
		go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it--
		stuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died, 
		but I lived, and I grew all these like weird 
		organs that have never been seen in humans 
		before.  So now I can do things like this!

He leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle 
dribble onto the table...

CLOSE ON THE TABLE -

as the spittle burns a hole in the Formica.

					SPLEEN
		Cool, huh?

The Spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three 
heroes duck out of the way or under the table.

				FURIOUS, RAJA, & SHOVELER
		Watch it!... Look out!... Whoa!

The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands 
to their mouths, and immediately leave.

					SPLEEN
		Sorry, sorry.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?

					SPLEEN
		I tried that once.  The cork melted.

THE SAME - AFTER DINNER

Our heroes mull their situation over coffee.  Monica freshens their 
cups.  The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.

					SHOVELER
		There's just not enough of us.

					FURIOUS
		But we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe 
		thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who 
		desperately need a cause...

					RAJA
		And a social life.

					SHOVELER
		Yeah, but how do we get to them?

					SPLEEN
		Obscene phone calls?

They ignore that suggestion.

					MONICA
		Why don't you throw a barbecue?
			(moves off to another table)

ON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT - WITH MUSIC

Invisible Boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little 
notes on small file cards.  (He's made a whole pile of them.)

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Got superpowers?  Want to fight evil?  Then JOIN US and 
let's PARTY HEARTY!  Beer!  Burgers!  Babes!"

SERIES OF SHOTS - MUSIC CONTINUES

as our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where 
lonely superheroes night find them...

The Raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...

The Shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...

Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone 
booth...

At an abandoned drive-in movie theater... Invisible Boy walks through 
the empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...

A White Castle hamburger joint... Inside the pay toilet Spleen is 
scratching something on the wall with a nail. He stops and admires his 
handiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the 
wall...

END MUSIC.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - DAY

A small, typical working class backyard.  A round, aluminum above 
ground pool.  A Weber grill with burgers on it. Unopened packages of 
hamburger rolls.  An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box.  The 
Spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.

					SPLEEN
		Come on in!  The water's great!

In fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... The rest of our 
heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs.  No superheroes have shown 
up.  The Shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand 
in line waiting for them.

					BUTCH
				(heavy on the sarcasm)
		Great picnic, Dad.

					EDDIE JR.
		Big turnout.

					ROLAND
		Are these guys real superheroes?

					LENORE
		They think so.

The kids scoff...  A moment later they head back to the house with 
their burgers.

					ROLAND
		But where's Captain Amazing?

					EDDIE JR.
		He wouldn't be caught dead here.

They go into the house.  No one says anything.  The Shoveler just 
stares at the burgers on the grill.  Vic Damon sings. Furious chugs his 
beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.

ON THE SPLEEN, munching on a chlorine tablet.

					SPLEEN
		Hey, these pool mints are delicious!

Raja looks at his watch.

					RAJA
		Maybe there was traffic.

					FURIOUS
		Who are we kidding?  No one's gonna show.  
		We're living in a fantasy!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.

					FURIOUS
		Good or evil, what's the difference?

					SHOVELER
		There's a big difference.

					FURIOUS
		I used to believe that.  Now I'm not so sure.

					RAJA
		Roy, remember, it is all within your power.  
		The only thing that's in your way... is you.

					FURIOUS
		Oh shut up.

Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.  Everyone immediately perks up.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		They're here!

A moment later they open the gate and see... HALF A DOZEN BURLY GUYS 
wearing various superhero outfits.

					THEIR LEADER
		Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?

					RAJA
		This is it.  Come on in!

					SUPERHEROES
		All right!  Party!  (Etc.)

At first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are 
decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain 
capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them.  Their leader holds a 
squeegee with a long handle... Furious is suspicious.

					RAJA
		I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.

					THEIR LEADER
		I am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres, 
		the Invincible Dudes!

The Invincible Dudes spot the keg.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Whoa!  Brews!  Party!  (Etc.)

They go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling 
them down.  The Raja tries to hand out some forms.

					RAJA
		Would you mind filling out these forms; names, 
		addresses, description of superpowers, that 
		sort of thing.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Sure, dude.  No problem.  (Etc.)
			(but they just toss the forms away)

ON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 1
		Hey, man, like where are the babes?

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 2
		It said on the card there'd be babes!

					RAJA
		Actually we lied about the babes, but there's 
		plenty of burgers.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		That's false advertising!... We came all the 
		way from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone 
		plinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No babes.  No peace.

					INVISIBLE DUDES (chanting)
		No babes--no peace!  No babes--no peace!  No 
		babes--no peace!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		Let's trash the place!

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Yeah!

Furious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.

					FURIOUS
		If you're a superhero, what's your power?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		I am Squeegee Man.
			(holding it out threateningly)
		Touch my squeegee... and you die.

The Invincible Dudes are cracking up.

					FURIOUS
		Can you fly?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No.

					FURIOUS
		Wanna bet?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE YARD - CONTINUOUS

as Squeegee Man comes flying--and screaming--over the fence, landing 
none too gracefully in the front yard.

A beat and his squeegee come flying out after him.  Another beat and 
the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!

They take off down the street, running right past a woman, carrying a 
bowling ball bag and dressed in a faded, threadbare old rayon superhero 
costume with a decidedly fifties flavor. She is THE BOWLER.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - A MOMENT LATER

Our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		Who died?

They look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to 
make of her.

					RAJA
		Who are you?

					BOWLER
		I'm the Bowler.

					SHOVELER
		The Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a
		kid.  He was killed years ago.

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

Our heroes share a look.

					SHOVELER
		Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a
		guy thing.

					BOWLER
		Really?

She takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like 
a Harlem Globetrotter).  For a long moment she just looks at them, 
smiling.

ON THE OTHERS watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...

Suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the 
ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war 
club--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...

Then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... It shoots 
straight through Invisible Boy's legs...

ON A NEATLY PLACED COLLECTION OF PLASTER LAWN DWARVES -

as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... It goes into a 
reverse spin, passes through Invisible Boy's legs again, and returns to 
the Bowler who is holding its bag open for it... The ball rolls in.

					BOWLER
		Good ball.

ON OUR HEROES, left absolutely speechless.

					BOWLER
		If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be 
		impressed, right?

She turns and walks out.  Our heroes share an amazed look, then run 
after her...

JUST OUTSIDE THE GATE - ON THE BOWLER

walking away... as Furious catches up with her.

					FURIOUS
		Hey... Can I buy you a beer?

					BOWLER
		I thought you'd never ask.

She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's 
backyard... but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place 
between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a 
frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep 
shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.  We do not 
know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.

BACK AT THE BARBECUE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON

A FADED OLD SNAPSHOT of the original "The Bowler" holding a little girl 
in his arms.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		He was more than just a superhero...  He was my 
		father...

The others, touched by this, have gathered around the Bowler, who is 
holding the old snapshot in her hand.

					BOWLER
		And then one day, he didn't come home.  The 
		police said it was an accident.  But cargo 
		containers don't just fall on people.  He was 
		murdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped 
		out of school, became a mud wrestler, married 
		and divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit 
		bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her 
		attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and 
		costume, almost like he'd left them there for 
		me... and I knew what I had to do.

					SHOVELER
		So who killed him?
	
					BOWLER
		The Disco Boys.

					FURIOUS
		You know something? Those guys are really 
		starting TO PISS ME OFF!

					SHOVELER
		But there's still only six of us.

					FURIOUS
		SO WHAT?

					BOWLER
		That's two more than the Fantastic Four.

					FURIOUS
		Half a Dirty Dozen!

					SPLEEN
		Twice the Three Stooges!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		And only one short of the Magnificent Seven.

					RAJA
		And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.

					BOWLER
		He was cute though.

					RAJA
		But they all had one thing we haven't got.

					SPLEEN
		Girlfriends?

					RAJA
		A name.  All the great superhero teams have got 
		a fabulous name.

They all think about it for a moment.  You can almost smell their 
brains overheating.

					BOWLER
		How about... the Savage Six?

					RAJA
		The Inscrutable Six?

					SPLEEN
		The Six Pistols?

					SHOVELER
		The Exterminators!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The Obliterators!

					RAJA
		The Eradicators!

					BOWLER
		The Emasculators!

					SPLEEN
		Wait--I got it!... The Spleen Team.

He gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.

					FURIOUS
		To hell with a name.  Let's get to work.

MUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.  The others stand and follow 
him... as our heroes form up for their first HEROIC GROUP SHOT.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as A LITTLE OLD LADY crosses the street, when suddenly 
she looks up and sees a pair of headlights coming on fast.  An 
immaculately maintained seventies limo is heading straight for her.

INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Disco Boys sit in the front.  Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit in the 
back, dressed for a night on the town...

There is a thud as the limo hits the old lady, and everyone in the car 
explodes into laughter.

					TONY P
		Little old lady.  That's a hundred points!

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE LIMO - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the limo drives past a billboard with an ad for "MILK" with a milk 
mustached Captain Amazing looking at the camera...

					TONY P
		He knows your every move.

Tony P imitates a massive electrical convulsion, and the villains crack 
up.

But as they pass the billboard, a pair of headlights illuminate in its 
shadows, and the Shoveler's Ford Esquire pulls out and follows.

INSIDE THE ESQUIRE - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is driving.  Mister Furious sits in the front seat next to 
him, and our other heroes are packed into the back.

					FURIOUS
		Let's say hello.

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE TWO CARS - CONTINUOUS

As the limo stops at a traffic light... and the Esquire pulls up 
alongside it.  For a moment good and evil stare each other down.

					TONY P
		Not these guys again!

The Disco Boys howl with laughter.

					CASANOVA
		Nice car.

The D Boys laugh.  Furious stares at Casanova, and Casanova stares 
right back at him, as cool as a snake.

					FURIOUS
		What did you do with Captain Amazing?

					CASANOVA
		Captain who?

					TONY P
				(spots the Bowler)
		Hey, in the backseat, who are you supposed to 
		be, the Bowler?

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

					TONY P
		His daughter?  Well guess what, sweetheart?  
		I'm the one who squished your Daddy.  And he 
		squished real good!

The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE.  He swings 
open his car door, mashing it into the limo and leaving a big dent.

					TONY P
		HEY!

					FURIOUS
		'SCUSE ME!

He starts punching the limo like it's a punching bag--putting big dents 
in it.

					TONY
		Waste him!

Tony and the boys all reach into their coats for their pistols--but as 
they yank them out, the Spleen sticks his head out of the station 
wagon, puts his face right up to the open window of the limo and lets 
loose with a TREMENDOUS BELCH...

As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes 
on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big 
dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening 
the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the 
back of his hand...

Then he leaps up on top of the limo...

While inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are stomped into 
the roof above them...

ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHEILD as Furious leaps down onto the hood, and 
gazes in at them.

					FURIOUS
		Shall I check your oil?

He plunges his hand through the metal of the hood, pulls out the car's 
dip stick, and checks it.

					FURIOUS
		Looks fine.

He tosses the dip stick away, then leaps off JUST AS Tony P gets off a 
shot, EXPLODING the windshield of the limo.

Furious lands safely on the hood of the station wagon.  As the Shoveler 
throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...

					FURIOUS
		NICE CAR!

And our heroes streak off into the night... Casanova and the others 
stagger out of the demolished limo, sucking in the clean air.

					CASANOVA
				(impressed by Furious)
		That boy's got talent.

					TONY P
		And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.

ANGLE ON A DARKENED ALLEY -

where the man in the strange steel mask can be seen... watching.

EXT.  A BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A very typical, nondescript neighborhood place...

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes stand at the bar, celebrating their first victory.

					SHOVELER
		To us!

					RAJA
		Whatever our name is.

They toast and drink.

THE SAME - LATER

The Spleen is passed out at a table, snoring. Shoveler and Invisible 
Boy sit next to him.

					SHOVELER
		Even his snores smell bad.

Raja and Bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.

					BOWLER
		But she's your mother.  You gotta tell her.

					RAJA
		I can't.

ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid 
		waste of time.

					SHOVELER
		But he plays golf, right?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yeah.

BACK ON RAJA AND BOWLER -

					RAJA
		I'm her only son, and she always had such high 
		hopes for me. Medicine.  Law.

					BOWLER
		But you're a superhero.

					RAJA
		The cape.  The turban.  She wouldn't 
		understand.

					BOWLER
		I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I 
		put on the mask.  They thought I'd lost it.

					RAJA
		But in fact... you'd found it.

They clink their glasses and drink.

BACK ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY -

					SHOVELER
		This is your dream... and you can't ever give 
		it up.

The Spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I wonder what he dreams about?

					SHOVELER
		We don't want to know.

Mr. Furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry 
thoughts..

OUTSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

A black van drives slowly past the bar.

INSIDE THE VAN - CONTINUOUS

The van is packed with Disco Boys.  Tony P sits in the front seat.

					TONY P
		There.

HIS POV -

He has spotted the Ford Esquire parked in the lot.

BACK IN THE BAR - A LITTLE LATER

ON THE BOWLER AND RAJA -

					BOWLER
		It's late.  I'm headin' home.

					RAJA
		Me, too.

					BOWLER
				(to Invisible Boy)
		Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

JUST OUTSIDE - A MONENT LATER

As our heroes, carrying the Spleen, leave.

					FURIOUS
		Anybody up for a little White Castle?

But suddenly the world is a whirling sass of chains and clubs as they 
are bushwhacked by the Disco Boys...

EXT.  AN ALLEY - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as he comes to with a qroan and sees... the Bowler and Invisible Boy 
tied up and gagged, with the Raja, Shoveler, and the Spleen trussed up 
right next to them.  Furious looks up, sees Tony P standing over him.

					TONY P
		Hi, cutie.

Furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire 
chains.  Tony P takes out a large caliber revolver, flips it open to 
make sure it's loaded.

					TONY P
		Six losers. Six bullets. Perfect... Got any 
		last words, Angry Boy?

					FURIOUS
		Disco sucks.

					TONY P
		Disco sucks.  Very good.  You know what I'm 
		gonna do, Angry Boy, since you're so colorful?  
		I'm gonna save you for last.

He turns and points the pistol right at Invisible Boy's head. Furious 
struggles against his chains--to no avail.

					TONY P
		Sweet dreams, punk.

Invisible Boy closes his eyes... Tony P cocks the pistol... But 
suddenly, there is the ring of steel--a broad blade sweeps through the 
air, and Tony P's pistol is sliced neatly in half.

					TONY P
				(holding half a pistol)
		HOLY...

The man is the strange steel mask is standing there, the drawn machete 
still in his hand.

					MAN IN MASK
		Buenos naches.

					TONY P
		Get him!

The Disco Boys rush the newcomer, but he slices through their baseball 
bats with his machete, and sends them reeling and crashing into each 
other with expert forearm blows, whacks with the flat of his blade, and 
head butts with his mask.

Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are 
too strong... and the stranger doesn't need any help.

Tony P flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who 
sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him.  Tony P 
turns, about to charge again.

					MAN IN MASK
				    (Mexican accent)
		Would you like me to trim the sides?

					TONY P
		What?

Tony P feels the top of his head, and realizes that the blow from the 
machete has neatly sliced off the top his disco-do, leaving only 
stubble on the top of his head.

					TONY P
			     	  (freaking out)
		LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

Tony and the Disco Boys run for it...

Furious and the others study their masked savior, who stands before 
them, machete in hand.

					FURIOUS
		You're the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		And you are a fool.

He raises his machete above Furious' head... and then slices clean 
through the chains.

EXT.	AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

Our heroes have gathered around a scrap wood fire in a steel drum. They 
sit on the ground and on old car seats, feeling like schmucks as the 
Sphinx chews theu out, his mask looking very friqhtening and magical in 
the flickering light.

					SPHINX
		You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster 
		fights more intelligently than you!  You have 
		shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your 
		powers to him--and what have you accouplished 
		for this?  You have destroyed his car.  
		Brilliant!  If you want to survive you must 
		fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack!

Furious sulks, but the others get the point.

					SPHINX
		The wolf is cunning.  He knows that stealth is 
		his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a 
		team...
					(more)

				SPHINX (Cont'd)
				(at Furious)
		Not like some drunken Tejano on Saturday night.

Furious grunts.

					SPHINX
		Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil.  
		You will need more than shovels and dessert 
		forks to stop him... What else have you got?

They are silent.

					FURIOUS
				     (angrily)
		So what else has Superman got?

					SHOVELER
		He's got the fact that he's Superman!

					BOWLER
		Bullets bounce off him!

Furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.

					RAJA
		Firepower costs money.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Anybody got any?

A silence.

					SHOVELER
		We didn't think this through very well.

					BOWLER
				(after a moment)
		My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

Our heroes stand looking at an old farubouse.  The place is an absolute 
wreck.  It hasn't been painted in twenty-five years. Windows are 
boarded up.  Half the shingles are gone.  There's visible fire damage 
around the kitchen window.

					SHOVELER
		Are you sure he's still lives here?

					RAJA
		Are you sure he's still alive?

					BOWLER
		He was the last time I saw him.

					SHOVELER
		When was that?
	
					BOWLER
		I was eight.

She is about to knock, but the door is suddenly yanked open, and an 
eighty year old guy is standing there.  He's got a wild head of white 
hair (that looks like a living explosion), and he wears a stained old 
lab coat with stickum mtssages to himself stuck to it, non-matching 
slippers, and a pair of thick glasses with frames that have been 
composited of half a dozen different old pairs all taped and welded 
together into a fantastic concoction.  He is DOC HELLER.

					HELLER
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		Doctor Heller?

					HELLER
				(doesn't recognize her)
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		It's me... Elizabeth.

					HELLER
		Elizabeth!  Little Elizabeth!  Why you're so... 
		middle aged!

					BOWLER
		Thanks.

					HELLER
		How's your dad?

					BOWLER
		He's dead.

					HELLER
		Oh that's right--they squished him...  Heck of 
		a guy.

Furious throws a look at the Shoveler and Raja.  This guy's out of it.  
They're wasting their time.

					BOWLER
		Doc, these are my friends.  We're superheroes, 
		and we need your help.

					HELLER
		Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that 
		sort of covers--

					SPHINX
		Doctor, we need your weapons.

					HELLER
				    (ecstatic)
		My weapons? You need my weapons?

EXT.  BEHIND THE HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER - MOVING ANGLE

as Doctor Heller leads them all briskly across his overgrown yard 
toward... the barn.

					HELLER
		The military establishment has never understood 
		me.  They won't return my phone calls, much 
		less field test anything.  But I knew that 
		someday I'd get my chance, and now... here you 
		are!
			   (pulls open the barn door)

INT.  THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

As our heroes step into Heller's laboratory/arsenal.  A stack of small 
aluminum cans lines one wall.  There are weird lookinq sprayers, tubes, 
and strange homemade toy-like devices... but there isn't a firearm in 
sight.

					RAJA
		But, Doc... where's the machine guns?

					SHOVELER
		The bazookas?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The lasers?

					HELLER
		You don't need that junk!  You see, for 
		thousands of years mankind has been immolating, 
		disemboweling, and exploding itself.  Why?  
		Because we have this built-in screwed up need 
		to go to war!
					(more)

					HELLER (Cont'd)
		So as a young man I thought, why nat have the 
		fun and excitement of war, without all that 
		unnecessary bloodshed.  That's why I have 
		devoted my life to developing an arsenal of 
		highly sophisticated non-lethal military 
		weapons.
				(points to a hand held tube)
		Air cannons... Blame throwers... Feet seeking 
		missiles... And perhaps my ultimate 
		invention...
	   		   (picks up one of the small cans)
		The canned tornado.

Furious groans, and the others share a look.  This guy's really a nut.

					HELLER
		Now here's a beauty!
			(picks up a purple and orange sprayer
			that looks like a suped up water gun)
		I call it the Shrinker!  I developed it after 
		years of studying the worst dry cleaners I 
		could find.  It instantly shrinks fabrics to 
		half their size.  Anyone caught in its spray is 
		immediately immobilized by their own clothing!

					FURIOUS
		Let's get out of here.

Furious turns and goes out, and the others start to follow. But the 
Bowler picks up a canned tornado.

OUTSIDE THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

as Furious walks away, the Bowler steps out of the barn.

					BOWLER
		Hey, Mister Bad Mood.

Furious stops, turns back.

					BOWLER
			(pulls the ring on the can)
		Catch.

She tosses the can to him.  He catches it--just as a small angry 
tornado FUNNELS out of the can.  It catches Furious and lifts him high 
in the air... then dissipates to nothing...

A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.

ON THE OTHERS, amazed.

Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off.  He starts 
back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can. The others get 
out of his way, as, muttering angrily to himself, he goes back into the 
barn...

And emerges a moment later, toting the air cannon.

					HELLER
		He's got the air cannon!

The others think he's going to use it on them and scatter for cover. 
but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target... 
He sees an old abandoned outhouse, puts the air cannon to his shoulder, 
aims, and fires...

There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the 
cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn.  But 
the big rush of air hits the shed dead center... and BLOWS IT TO 
PIECES, leaving only the old seat.

Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.

					FURIOUS
		Doc, you're a genius!
				     (hugs him)

					HELLER
		I know.

					FURIOUS
				(turns to the others)
		Okay! We got the firepower!  I say we throw it 
		into the car, drive over to Casanova's house, 
		and kick some ass!

					SPHINX
		No.

The others ignore Furious and listen to the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		We are not yet ready.  Now we must learn to 
		fight together... as one thing.

The others nod in agreemnt... while Furious fumes.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - TRAINING AT THE FARM

CLOSE ON DOC HELLER aiming his air cannon... CAMERA PULLS BACK TO 
REVEAL our heroes (minus Furious) standing in a pack right behind him, 
holding him down. HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently, 
but it doesn't knock them over...

as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and 
shake their fists... while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines, 
drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.

VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team... crawling across 
the grass together....charginq in a line... hurling canned tornadoes... 
while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous 
of the Sphinx.

Shoveler, Bowler, and the Sphinx stand shoulder to shoulder, as 
Invisible Boy, Spleen, Raja, and the Doc throw small stones at them... 
They deflect the pebbles with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... 
Theyre having fun.  They're becoming a team...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE BARN - EVENING

Furious drinks alone, while the rest of our heroes sit around an old 
picnic table, feasting on sodas and pizza (like a football team after a 
great practice.)  Raja explains the history of the situation to the 
Sphinx.

					RAJA
		Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this 
		city were united into one great brotherhood of 
		evil, and Casanova was their king.

					SHOVELER
		Crime was rampant.  It wasn't safe to stay in 
		your home.

					BOWLER
		Much less go outside.

					SHOVELER
		Then Captain Amazing appeared.

					RAJA
		He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.

					SHOVELER
		And this has been a pretty nice place to live 
		ever since.

					FURIOUS
				    (pissed off)
		But now Casanova's back!  And we're gonna sit 
		around here all night eating pizza and telling 
		stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!

					SPHINX
		The wise snake coils before he strikes.

					FURIOUS
				(lunges at the Sphinx)
		And a skunk stinks!

Furious and the Sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.

					SPHINX
		You drink too much.

					FURIOUS
		When are you going to take off that mask?

					SPHINX
				    (pointedly)
		When I am sure I am among friends.

					RAJA
		Roy--

					FURIOUS
				(snapping at him)
		Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!

ON THE RAJA, hurt.

					SPHINX
		Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds 
		you to your heart.

					FURIOUS
		My heart died a long time ago.

					SPHINX
		It is not dead.  It is hiding.

					FURIOUS
		Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to 
		hell with the rest of you!... Look at you.  
		Bunch of rejects.  I didn't need you before--
		and I don't need you now!
			(jumps on to his motorcycle)
		The great ones RIDE ALONE!
			(kicks the engine started)
		Adios, muchachos!
			(and he rides off across the field)

ON THE OTHERS, watching him...

					BOWLER
		Has he always been like this?

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

the wind whipping against his face, as he rides his Harley at about a 
hundred miles an hour... The languorous sound of an OLD DEAN MARTIN 
SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

MENORY SEQUENCE - DAY - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as a little boy, sitting in the backseat of the family car. It is 
thirty years ago, and Mister Furious is a sweet, very shy, well 
behaved, perfectly normal three year old.  His MOTHER and FATHER sit in 
the front.  Dean Martin is playing on the car radio.  Little Furious 
looks out the window and sees the Mohave Desert going by.  A sign reads 
"Las Vegas, 120 miles".

					MOTHER
				   (to husband)
		Oh this place looks great.

An old sign reads "BAR" as the family car pulls into the parking lot of 
a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere.  They park.

					MOTHER
		Now honey, you just wait in the car.  Mommy and 
		Daddy will be right beck.

They get out, lock the car and head for the bar, leaving the windows 
up.  Little Furious watches them go, never suspecting that his entire 
life is about to change.  He sits quietly in the backseat and plays 
with the little superhero figurines that he's brought with him.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Pow!  Bang!  Wham!

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

as the parents enter.  A very Western motif.  An old Gene Autrey song 
is playing on the juke.  The air conditioning is on.	They're the only 
customers in the place.

					MOTHER
		It's nice and cool in here.

					FATHER
				(as they sit at the bar)
		Barkeep, a couple of cold ones.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CAR AND BAR -

ANGLE ON THE MIDDAY SON - blazing down on the car...

as Little Furious still plays with his superheroes, but the interior is 
starting to bake, and the sweat begins to pour ofr him.  He looks out 
at the bar. gettinq worried.  He tries the windows, but they're 
automatic and won't open...

Back in the bar his parents down shots of bourbon with their beers, as 
the BARTENDER finishes telling them a joke.

					BARTENDER
		And here's a banana for your monkey.

Mom and Dad have a good laugh.

					BARTENDER
		Couple more?

					FATHER
		You bet.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE TUE CAR as Little Furious, sweat and tears pouring 
out of him, his hair wet and sticking out (and starting to take on that 
familiar look), pounds on the window.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Mommy!  Daddy!  Mommy!  Daddy!

as back in the bar his parents, now very drunk, down more beers and 
chasers as they play a spirited game of pinball.

ANGLE ON THE MOHAVE SUN - beating down mercilessly

barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his 
face a mask of heat and terror... But suddenly, a change begins to take 
place in him, as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in... and his 
fear begins to give way to rage... His teeth bare.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS -

as they CRUSH the superhero figurines in their grasp...

While back in the bar his drunken parents dance a slow two step to Hank 
Williams "Your Cheatin' Heart"...

EXT.  TBE PARKING LOT - NIGHT - HANK WILLIAMS CONTINUES

as the big desert moon shines down on the family car, still parked 
there.

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

The parents are asleep in a booth.  Furious' mother wakes up, looks 
around groggily, and in a moment of horror suddenly remembers...

					MOTHER
		OH MY GOD!

THE PARKING LOT - A BEAT LATER

as she runs toward the car, hysterical.

					MOTHER
		Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!

She unlocks the door, throws it open, and sees something that makes her 
pull back in horror... Little Furious sits in the backseat.  His hair 
sticks out wildly, his face has become that now familiar mask of 
prisordial rage.  Another OLD DEAN MARTIN SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on 
his face; he is still that little boy.  The Dean Martin song is playing 
on the juke.

					MONICA (0.S.)
		Hi.

He looks up and sees Monica.

					FURIOUS
		Hi.

					MONICA
		Alone tonight?

					FURIOUS
		Every night.

She smiles.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Armed Disco Boys guard the front entrance...

While on the hillside above Invisible Boy (looking through binoculars) 
and the Spleen lie together on their bellies in the weeds, keeping the 
mansion under surveillance.

					SPLEEN
				  (in a whisper)
		Adolescence was the worst--The other kids made 
		fun of me, so I'd spit on them and they'd 
		scatter--I've never had a girlfriend--unless 
		you count that night with my cousin--She 
		recovered fully though--We exchange cards every 
		Christmas--Well, I send her one, and she sends 
		it back...
			(spritzes somathing into his mouth,
			then offers it to Invisible Boy)
		Bug repellent?

Suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans... followed 
by a truck, drive out...

POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -

Casanova and Anabel sit in the front of the truck.

					INVISIBLE BOY (0.S.)
		Where are they going?

Invisible Boy hesitates for just a momnt, then gets up and runs down 
the hill.

					SPLEEN
				(runs after him)
		Kid!

As the small convoy drives past, Invisible Boy slips out from behind 
some trees, runs after the truck, jumps up and sits on its rear bumper.  
The Spleen comes running after him, and Invisible Boy reaches out, 
grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him.  Invisible Boy tries the 
rear gate.  It's open. The two of them pull it up just a foot, squirm 
inside, then pull it closed behind them.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Invisible Boy flashes the light of his key chain flashlight around the 
inside of the truck.  There is nothing in it, except for a large pile 
of packing blankets.

EXT.  WATERFRONT AREA - NIGHT

as the convoy drives through Champion City's seedy waterfront area and 
out onto a long pier.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE TV

Dawn Wong and Don Stouffer report the night's news.

					DAWN
		...still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and 
		now, in an unrelated story, another one of 
		Champion City's leading citizens has apparently 
		disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen 
		or heard from in a week. Authorities believe 
		that the hard working superhero may just be 
		taking a well deserved rest.

					DON
		Cancun perhaps?

					DAWN
		Sounds good to me, Don.

Mr. Furious sits in the booth drinking coffee as Monica serves him his 
burger and fries.

					FURIOUS
				   (floundering)
		Monica... I was wondering if--uh-maybe we--I 
		mean you and I--could-uh--you know--get a--I 
		mean have a...

					MONICA
		Date?

					FURIOUS
		Yeah.

					MONICA
		I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me 
		home?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

					MONICA
		That was easy.
				(goes back to work)

ON FURIOUS, feeling a whole lot better.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - UNKNOWN POV

from across the street.  Furious' head is clearly visible in the 
brightly illuminated window of the diner.

A Disco Boy stands in the shadows, gazing at the diner; he recognizes 
Furious.

EXT.  WATERFRONT - NIGHT

The convoy has pulled up alongside a rusty old freighter, docked at the 
pier.

Casanova's men throw the gate of the truck open, and the CAMERA MOVES 
IN.  No one is there, but we notice... two large lumps under the 
packing blankets.

Casanova holds Anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden crate 
being lowered from the deck of the freighter.

					CASANOVA
		Honey, our ship's come in.

Casanova's cellular phone rings.

OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS

The Disco Boy is on his phone.  His pistol is drawn, and he's got it 
aimed right at Furious' head.

					DISCO BOY
		Just give me the word.

BACK TO THE PIER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
				   (gets an idea)
		Wait.  I'll be right there.
				(hangs up, starts off)

					ANABEL
				     (peeved)
		Where are you going?

					CASANOVA
		Head hunting.

A minute later Casanova and two or three Disco Boys drive off in one of 
the sedans... as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is 
pulled closed... and locked.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A MOMENT LATER

The engine starts up, and the truck starts to move, as Invisible Soy 
and the Spleen poke their heads out from under the packing blankets... 
They approach the crate and Invisible Boy shines his flashlight on it.  
The crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands; there's no way 
they're going to be able to get inside it, but in the light of the 
flashlight they see...

Faded red lettering, in Russian, and the distinctive old hammer and 
sickle of the former Soviet Union.

EXT.  DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

Furious walks Monica home.

					MONICA
		I admire you.

					FURIOUS
		Why?

					MONICA
		Being a superhero, wanting to save the world.  
		It's so... unselfish.

					FURIOUS
		It is?

					MONICA
		Most people just want to make money or be 
		famous or something.  But you risk everything, 
		just to help people.

					FURIOUS
				(after a moment)
		I wouldn't mind being famous.

					MONICA
		Who wouldn't?

In the shadows behind them... Casanova follows, stalking them, as 
silent as a vampire.

					MONICA
		I've never been able to figure out what to do 
		with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a 
		waitress.

					FURIOUS
		Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

					MONICA
		What's your real name?

					FURIOUS
		Roy.

					MONICA
		Have you always lived here?

He nods.

					MONICA
		Me too... I love this stupid old town.  It's 
		noisy.  It's smelly. It's falling apart.

					FURIOUS
		It's home.

					MONICA
		Yeah.

CASANOVA'S POV

Monica, smiling, looking lovely.

CLOSE 0N CASANOVA; he wants her...

BACK ON FURIOUS AND MONICA -

					MONICA
		I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or 
		New York, but...

					FURIOUS
		What have they got that we ain't got?

					MONICA
		Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to 
		be here when it does.

					FURIOUS
		Me, too.

					MONICA
		You don't seem very angry right now.

He shrugs.  And they kiss, very tenderly.

					MONICA
		You know what?  Underneath all that anger I 
		think there's just a little boy who wants 
		everyone to love him.

					FURIOUS
		I just want to be a superhero.

					MONICA
		That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

She turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes 
inside, as Furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to. He 
really likes her.  He starts walking back down the street, past a man 
sitting on the stoop.  The man looks up.  It's Casanova Frankenstein.

				CASANOVA
		Going my way?

Furious is caught completely by surprise--he takes a stand, ready to 
fight.

				CASANOVA
		Take it easy--take it easy.  I just want to 
		have a little chat... That was quite a number 
		you did on my car.  You've got a lot of 
		violence in you... and I like that in a guy.

Furious, silent.

					CASANOVA
		You know what the difference is between good 
		and evil, Roy?

Furious reacts to the fact that Casanova knows his real name.

					CASANOVA
		Evil is more fun.  When you want something, you 
		just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, 
		you kill them... You seem like a very 
		frustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled.  
		What is it that you've always wanted, always 
		desired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it 
		to you... Fame?
				(snaps his fingers)
		Easy.  Fortune?  Even easier. Women?
					(laughs)
		The easiest of all.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS as, out of the corner of his eye, he catches movement 
in the alley across the street... he knows what it is.

					CASANOVA
		I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy.  In 
		two days this entire city will belong to me, 
		and there's not a damn thing your little pals 
		can do about it.  It's the perfect time to 
		switch teams... So what do you say?

					FURIOUS
				     (quietly)
		You're nuts.

					CASANOVA
					(flairs)
		They always call the great ones nuts.

					FURIOUS
		And the nuts always call themselves great.

					CASANOVA
				(his psychosis showing)
		Are you with me... or against me?

					FURIOUS
		Against.

					CASANOVA
		Too bad.  PLUG HIM!

Gunfire rings out from the alley as the Disco Bays step out, their 
pistols blazing.  But Furious has anticipated them.  He leaps right at 
Casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of 
fire.

					CASANOVA
		WAIT!

The Disco BQys stop firing... Furious drags Casanova back into an empty 
lot, using him as a shield.

					FURIOUS
				   (to Casanova)
		Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.

					CASANOVA
		You're dead.

					FURIOUS
		So are you!

Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden 
wall at the end of the lot... as the Disco Boys open fire again, and 
their bullets punch holes through the wall...

Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure (that 
we recognize from the model on the TV interview with Casanova earlier.)  
A high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of 
featureless concrete. It looks both totally modern and completely 
ancient, but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully.

ANGLE ON a plaque that reads...  "Frankenstein Center for the 
Performing and Non-performing Arts".

The gates of the center open, and the convoy passes through.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A NONENT LATER

Invisible Boy and the Spleen stand listening, waiting, as they feel the 
truck pull to a stop...

A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with 
several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.

					ANABEL
		Be careful with my baby.

There are two lumps under the packing blankets again.

EXT.  LOADING DOCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The crate is being carried away by a forklift... A beat, and then 
Invisible Boy and the Spleen slip out of the empty truck...

And run down the road back toward the gates... which are still open.  
They're just about to pass safely through them, when a PAIR OF ARMED 
SECURITY GUARDS, step in their path, their guns pointed at thern.

					GUARD 1
		Freeze!

					GUARD 2
		Hands up!

They freeze, their hands held high.

					GUARD 2
		What are you two doing here?

Our heroes are mute.

					GUARD 1
		Not talking, eh?  That can be fixed.  Turn 
		around, start walking up the hill--

					GUARD 2
		And no funny business.

Invisible Boy and the Spleen turn, hands in the air, and start up the 
hill, the guards right behind them.

					SPLEEN
			(after a moment, to Invisible
				Boy, in a whisper)
		Pinch 'em.

Invisible Boy pinches his nostrils--and the Spleen lets out with a 
horrendous fart.  The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as 
our heroes turn and run for it... escaping out the gates.

INT.  DOC KELLER'S LABORATORY/BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Invisible Boy and Spleen report to the others.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia.

The others consider this, then hear a familiar voice.

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Is there room in the pack for one more wolf?

They look up and see that Furious has just returned... The Sphinx moves 
to him.  For a moment they stand face to face...

					FURIOUS
		I was wrong... I need my friends.

Sphinx takes off his mask, revealing that he is the busboy from the 
Tacky Taco.

					SPHINX
		Amigo.

They embrace.

A few mimutes later.  The others are gathered around Furious, listening 
to his story.

					FURIOUS
		Casanova said that in two days the entire city 
		would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing 
		that we could do about it.

					BOWLER
		What did he mean?

					FURIOUS
		I dunno.

Through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside, the 
Frankenstein Center silhouetted ominously against it. Raja, Shoveler, 
and Furious gaze at it.

					SHOVELER
		Maybe it's time we checked that place out.

					RAJA
		But how do we get in?

					FURIOUS
		(after a moment, sounding very Sphinx-like)
		We just become like the wolf... who wears the 
		sheep's clothing.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - THE NEXT DAY

CLASSIC DISCO ("Stayin' Alive" if we can get the rights)

Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes) walk down the street 
together and step into the doorway of... the Salvation Army Thrift 
Shop...

Later.  CLOSE ON three pairs of legs, wearing polyester pants and 
vintage shoes (ala the classic shot from "Saturday Night Fever")... 
CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL our three heroes, dressed in full blown 
seventies attire (with vintage sunglasses), doing their best Travolta 
strut down the street...

MUSIC CONTINUES as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the 
art center, right past the security guards...

OUTSIDE THE CENTER - DAY

They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them... 
then pass through the big wooden doors and into...

INT.  MAIN HALL - A MOMENT LATER

END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall... A 
small army of heavily armed security guards marches about.

					RAJA
		So where's the art?

					FURIOUS
		He hasn't stolen it yet.

					SHOVELER
		This place is built like a fortress.

					FURIOUS
		Because thats what it is.

They hear a WILD BURST OF DRUNKEN LAUGHTER echoing through the hall.

					RAJA
		What's that?

					FURIOUS
				(following the sound)
		Come on.

They approach a doorway.  The noise is coming from within.

INT.  BANQUET IIALL - A MOMENT LATER

as our heroes step inside and see... A big luncheon is in progress.  
Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit at the head table. The room is lined 
with banquet tables, which are filled with VICIOUS LOOKING CHARACTERS, 
drunk, eating, laughing, and giving the waitresses a very rough tim..

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		Oh my God... Every crook in the city is here.

ON A GROUP OF VICIOUS LOOKING BALD BIKER TYPES...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bone Heads from the South Side...

ON THREE INSIPIDLY EVIL LOOKING GUYS in hip suits...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bland Boys from Downtown...

ON A DARK HAIRED WHITE GUY dressed as a rapper...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		Italian Ice...

ON A GUY with a frightening assortment of metal things piercing his 
face...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Stapler...

ON TWO THUGS DRESSED AS ELVIS...

					RAJA (0.S.)
		The Elvis Brothers.

A more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch. Furious 
recognizes one of the waitresses...   It's Monica.

Casanova's got his eye on her, too, and he remembers her from the night 
before on the street with Furious.

ON ANABEL, noticing his interest.

Our heroes see Monica walking straight toward them. They turn away, 
lean against a wail, trying to be totally inconspicuous...

But as she passes them, not noticing them... Casanova approaches her.

					CASANOVA
		Excuse me.

She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet 
away...

					CASANOVA
				(reading her name tag)
		Monica... Beautiful name.  It suits you.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I 
		couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead 
		ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

					MONICA
		Really?

Furious growls.  Raja gives him an elbow.

					CASANOVA
		Are you an actress?

					MONICA
		Just a waitress.

					CASANOVA
		You underestimate yourself.

Mister Furious is fuming.  The strands of his perfectly coiffed disco-
do start to stand straight up.

					CASANOVA
		You know I'm writing a play--it's just a little 
		Broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that I 
		think you'd be perfect for.

					MONICA
		Really?

					CASANOVA
		I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick 
		around after the luncheon?

					MONICA
		Sure--I guess.

					CASANOVA
		Terrific.

She turns and walks into the kitchen.

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, watching her; his intentions are sinister...  He 
turns and sees... our heroes, hanging by the wall.

					CASANOVA
		What are you three doing here? This is invited 
		guests only.  Out.

Our heroes skulk out.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes step out and breathe a sigh of relief.

					RAJA
		That was too close.

					SHOVELER
		But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

					FURIOUS
		Hey.

Furious has spotted... a large covered dessert table, waiting to be 
wheeled into the hall.

BACK IN THE BANQUET HALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the dessert table is wheeled in... and in a CLOSER ANGLE, under the 
table cloth, we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along...

A few minutes later, Monica steps up to the dessert table... Suddenly, 
she is yanked under.

UNDER THE TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over 
her mouth.

					FURIOUS
		It's me.

She calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.

					MONICA
		What are you guys doing here?

				  RAJA & SHOVELER
		Shhhh!

The waitresses leave; the big doors to the dining room are swung 
closed, and the cigars are lit.  The meeting has begun. Casanova takes 
the podium.

					CASANOVA
		Thank you all for coming.  I hope you enjoy the 
		cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get 
		them.

Tony P chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with 
the rest of the crowd.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago, this town was yours!  AND I 
		WAS YOUR KING!

ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad 
old story.

					CASANOVA
				    (tragically)
		But they called me a psycho, and they put me 
		away.  For twenty years I rotted in my cell, 
		painting watercolors, writing haikus--just 
		waiting for the day I could take my revenge.  
		Well, brothers, that day has come!

ON OUR HEROES under the table, listening.  Monica begins to realize 
what's going on.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
		They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on 
		them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on 
		the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest--
		every man, woman, and child in this city is 
		going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC!  Mothers 
		will murder their tots!  Old ladies will 
		strangle their cats!  Children will bump off 
		their babysitters!

The guests think Casanova's completely lost it.  Italian Ice speaks up.

					ITALIAN ICE
		You're outta your mind!

					CASANOVA
		I beg your pardon?

					ITALIAN ICE
		Nobody could drive a whole city crazy.

					CASANOVA
		Tell you what, Ice.  I'll mke you a friendly 
		little wager.  It I can't do it... you can blow 
		my brains out.  If I can, I'll blow out yours.

Now the hoods' interest has been perked.

					ITALIAN ICE
		Done.

					CASANOVA
			(to Anabel, with a smile)
		Honey, give the boys a taste.

Anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors, 
then presses a button on a small remote control device.

ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium... as the air is suddenly 
filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between 
the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear) and 
everyone in the room (except Anabel) goes COMPLETELY BERSERK...

CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, 
gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...

Under the serving table our heroes go crazy...

Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and 
empties it into Italian Ice... who drops to the floor, dead.

Anabel presses the button again; the sound winds down and stops, and 
everything returns to normal.  The entire event lasted only a few 
seconds, but the guests are dazzled.

					CROOKS
		That was great!... What the hell was that?... 
		How did you do that?

Casanova throws Anabel a kiss.

					CASANOVA
		Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be 
		amplified across this entire city.  Murder and 
		mayhem will reign supreme!  And Champion City 
		will be ours again!  This will be our castle!  
		And I will be our king!  And there's no one to 
		stop us!

Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Not so fast, Casanova!

A pair of curtains suddenly part... and Captain Amazing (looking a bit 
singed) is standing there in classic superhero pose.

CAMERA PANS the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to 
terror.  They yank out their pistols, dive for cover under the table, 
throw up their hands in surrender, etc... But Casanova just grins.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, fellas...
			(moves to Captain Amazing, and
		puts his arm chummily around him)
		I killed him... and I've had him stuffed.

Casaova reaches behind Captain Amazing's back and pulls a string (like 
the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls).

					AMAZING
				(in a canned voice)
		Isn't my butt cute in these tights?
				   (pulls again)
		Blue is my color.
				   (pulls again)
		Oh, my abs are killing me!

The crooks are beside themselves with laughter.

ON OUR HEROES, under the table, stunned.

ON THE ELVIS BROTHERS -

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		The King is back!

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Long live the King!

The crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music 
fills the air and Casanova dances, basking in their adoration...

And our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their 
escape...

INT.  DOC HELLER'S BARN/LAB - LATER

Our heroes and Monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

					MONICA
		What could have made such a horrible noise?

					HELLER
			  (after a moment, gravely)
		He's got the Psychostridulator.

					ALL
		The what?

					HELLER
		Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret 
		Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a 
		prototype for a weapon that emitted a 
		fluctuating alternative frequency noise that 
		produced a violent psychotic reaction in any 
		mammal within hearing distance.  But when the 
		old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its 
		brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.

					SHOVELER
		This Kopov, what happened to him?

					HELLER
		Not him... her.

They react to that piece of news, and then the Bowler opens up the 
newspaper.

					BOWLER
		Did she look like that?

CLOSE ON A PHOTO of Anabel and Casanova, announcing their wedding 
engagement.

					HELLER
		Yes.

Silence; this is bad.

					SPLEEN
				    (hopefully)
		Maybe it won't work.

					FURIOUS
		It works.

					HELLER
		A village in Siberia was wiped out when a 
		cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.

Another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.  
For the first time, they're really scared.

					MONICA
		We've got to warn the city.

					SHOVELER
		How?

					RAJA
		No one will believe us.

					BOWLER
		They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

CAMERA CUTS BETWEEN THEM as they look at each other--their frightened 
faces, their sad, faded costuznes.  Even the Sphinx looks scared.

					FURIOUS
			   (after a moment, grimly)
		We know what we gotta do.

They look at him.

					RAJA
		We're outnumbered twenty to one.

					SHOVELER
		It's suicide.

					FURIOUS
		Maybe.  But this isn't about living or dying.  
		It's about good versus evil, and we're good, 
		whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a 
		little funny...

ON THE SPLEEN...

					FURIOUS
		And smell a little funny.  We're not 
		bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're 
		superheroes--and that means doing what's right-
		-even when it's impossible... This is our city-
		-these are our friends, our famlies--and if we 
		don't save them, nobody will!  So I say we take 
		a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, 
		destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach 
		those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

					SPHINX
		Now you're talking.

					BOWLER
		Sounds good to me.

					RAJA
		Let's do it.

					SHOVELER
		And we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!

They're all with him.  Monica steps forward.

					MONICA
		I just want you guys to know--I may not be a 
		superhero, but I'm with you--and I want to 
		help!

					ALL
		Oh that's great... Thanks, Monica...  (Etc.)

					BOWLER
		We could really use some coffee--

					SHOVELER
		And some sandwiches--

					SPLEEN
		With mustard!

					MONICA
			(her feelings a little hurt)
		Sure.

A few minutes later, Monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes 
plan...

					RAJA
		But that place is huge and we don't know where 
		this psycho thing is--

					BOWLER
		Or even what it looks like.

					HELLER
		And he must have it well hidden.

					FURIOUS
		We'll just have to get lucky.

ON MONICA as she gets an idea.  A moment later she slips a canned 
tornado into her purse... as the others put their arms around each 
other in a group huddle\embrace.

					FURIOUS
		Go do what you gotta do.  We'll meet back here 
		at sunset... Do or die.

					ALL
		Do or die.

					SPHINX
		Victoria o morte.

HEROIC MUSIC as...

EXT.  AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - DAY - CLOSE ANGLE ON

THE FRONT GRILL of the Herkimer Battle Jitney... as Mister Furious 
hooks it up to the "Sally's Auto Demolition" tow truck... A moment 
later he drives the tow truck, towing the off the lot, as Sally steps 
out of her office, pissed off...

					SALLY
		HEY!

EXT.  HELLER'S FARM - DAY

ON THE SPHINX, standing as immobile and silent as a statue... as a 
falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him... In a flash, his 
machete slices through the air, and the leaf continues fluttering down, 
but in two pieces...

INT.  LABORATORY/BARN - DAY

Doc Heller fine tunes his Shrinker spray... as the Bowler sits quietly 
in the hayloft, studying the old dog eared photo of her father and 
herself as a little girl...

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Invisible Boy stands in front of his mirror, eyes closed, concentrating 
for all he's worth, trying to become invisible...  He suddenly pops 
opens his eyes and looks at himuself in the mirror... but he's still 
completely visible. He flops onto his bed in frustration.

INT.  THE DINER - DAY

CLOSE ON A TABLE full of food... Eggplant Parmesan, broccoli, chili... 
CAKERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Spleen sitting alone in the booth, 
stuffing his face, gassing up for battle.

INT.  THE SHOVELER'S HOUSE - DAY

The Shoveler, standing in his bedroom, has just put on his freshly 
laundered suit.  CAMERA OPENS WIDE TO REVEAL Lucille, his wife, 
standing there, holding his just polished shovel. He takes it from her, 
then takes her in his arms.

					SHOVELER
		Baby, if I don't make it... find yourself... a 
		normal guy.

					LUCILLE
		I don't want a normal guy.

And they kiss.

A few minutes later... In the living room the Shoveler's kids lie 
sprawled in front of the television.  The Shoveler, in battle array, 
steps into the room.  Be wants to say something to them, but the kids 
don't even take their eyes off the TV look at him... He turns and walks 
out in silence.

END MUSIC...

INT.  THE RAJA'S DINING ROOM - DAY

The shades are drawn.  The Raja, in full costume, quietly loads 
silverware into the secret pockets of his cape. Suddenly, the light 
switches on... It's his mother.  She's caught him red handed.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!

					RAJA
		Mother... it's not what you think!

					MOTHER
		And why are you wearing that silly costume?

					RAJA
				   (painfully)
		Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!

ON HIS MOTHER, shocked.

					RAJA
		Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.  I know how much you 
		wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a 
		family--but it's just not who I am!

					MOTHER
		But... the silverware?

					RAJA
		I use it... to fight evil.

					MOTHER
				(after a moment)
		Jeffrey... this is wonderful.

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		It is?

					MOTHER
		I always knew that you were special.

					RAJA
		You did?

					MOTHER
		Ever since you were a little boy...
			(gets an idea, excited)
		Come with me.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

She pulls down the stairway to the attic...

INT.  THE ATTIC - A MOMENT LATER

She switches on the light and leads the Raja to a far corner...  where 
she moves a couple of old hat boxes, REVEALING an ancient leather bound 
box with the word "Excalibur" engraved in gold on the top.

					MOTHER
		This is for you.

The Raja opens the box and registers astonisha~nt as he sees...

A FABULOUS VICTORIAN SILVER SET packed with formidable looking servers, 
cake knives, ice cream forks.

					MOTHER
		Your Great Great Grandmother's wedding silver.

The Raja lifts up and handles a large heavily engraved pie server.

					RAJA
		Bitchin'.

EXT.  OUTSIDE HELLER'S BARN/LAB - EVENING - CLOSE ON

Mister Furious, wrench in hand, covered with grease and oil, cussing to 
himself as he works under the hood of the Herkimer.

					FURIOUS
		Try it again!

Invisible Boy, sitting behind the wheel, tries the ignition of the 
Herkimer, and the old engine grinds as it turns over, but doesn't 
catch.

					FURIOUS
		Come on, baby... Come on, baby... I SAID COME 
		ON!

Mister Furious SLUGS the engine with his fist, and it sputters and 
backfires into life... shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but 
running... Furious kisses the Herkimer... as the Bowler calls out to 
him from the barn.

					BOWLER
		Mon Capitan, it's for you.
				(tosses him the phone)

					FURIOUS
		Hello?

EXT.  UNKNOWN LOCATION - EVENING - CLOSE ON MONICA

					MONICA
			(on a phone, speaking very softly)
		It's me.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

					FURIOUS
		Monica, where are you?

BACK TO MONICA - WIDER ANGLE

REVEALING that she is on a pay phone just outside the art center.  
She's wearing make-up and a sexy little dress; she looks she's dressed 
for a date.  Disco Boys and security guards go about their business all 
around her.

					MONICA
		At the Frankenstein Center.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM -

					FURIOUS
		Are you nuts?  Get out of there!

					MONICA
		I'm going inside.

					FURIOUS
		What are you talking about?

					MONICA
		Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but 
		he's got a weakness, and I'm it.  Maybe--just 
		maybe--I can trick him into showing me the 
		location of the whatchamathing.

					FURIOUS
		He's a psycho!  He'll kill you!

					MONICA
		Just shut up and listen.  Hold off the attack 
		as long as you can.  If I can discover the 
		location I'll call you--

					FURIOUS
		And what if you get killed?

					MONICA
		Then at least I will have died trying, right?

Furious silent, taken aback by her courage.

					MONICA
		Roy... We might never see each other again, so 
		I'd better tell you now...  I think you're 
		wonderful.

					FURIOUS
			(caught completely off guard)
		What?

					MONICA
		Bye.
				(and she hangs up)

					FURIOUS
		Monica!

INT.  LOBBY OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as Monica approaches a GUARD standing by the main door.

					MONICA
		Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica is 
		here?

					GUARD
		Sure, doll.

BACK TO THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

Furious stands by the Herkimer, phone still in hand.  He seems 
speechless, dazed.  Something inside him has changed.

					BOWLER
				(worried about him)
		Hey... you okay?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Casanova steps out and sees... Monica, looking very sexy.

					MONICA
		Hi.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you'd chickened out on me.

					MONICA
		Just wanted to... powder my nose.

His eyes roam all over her; he knows she's up to something, but she 
looks yummy, and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves.

					MONICA
		How 'bout giving me "the tour"?

					CASANOVA
		Why not?

EXT.  COURTYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as Casanova leads Monica across an open courtyard toward... the sheer 
walls of the imposing central tower.

					CASANOVA
		Big, isn't it?

He leads her to a massive archway, the only apparent entrance to the 
tower.  But just as she is about to pass through, Monica looks up and 
sees something that makes her pull back with fear...

HER POV -

A very sinister looking SECURITY EYE gazes down at her from the top of 
the archway.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry.  It's not activated.

They pass through and into...

INT.  ROOM IN THE BASE OF TOWER - CONTINUOUS

which is filled with IMMENSE BRONZE SCULPTURES of voluptuous, scantily 
clad females in various poses of bondage.  Monica reacts; these things 
are scary.

					MONICA
		Who's the artist?

					CASANOVA
		Me.

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - NIGHT

The Bowler, Spleen, Invisible Boy, and Doc Heller load up the Herkimer 
with Heller's weaponry...

as Mister Furious lies sprawled on the hillside... breathing in the 
night air, contemplating a dandelion gone to seed, and listening to the 
sounds of the night.  The Raja, Shoveler, and Sphinx, stand nearby, 
watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.  A whippoorwill 
is heard singing.

					FURIOUS
		Listen.  He's lonely... and he doesn't care who 
		knows it.

Raja and Shoveler share a bewildered look.  The bird sings again.

					FURIOUS
		We're all the same really.  Our songs, our 
		dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt 
		to live forever.
			(blows the dandelion seeds into the wind)

					SPHINX
		He is in love.  His anger is gone.

					RAJA
		Oh no.

					SHOVELER
		Great timing!
	
					FURIOUS
		Has Monica called?

INT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova leads Monica into... a palatial room, filled with priceless 
objects d'art, all of which reflect Casanova's dark psyche.  A Munch 
painting.  Mayan idols.  Weird German furniture.  A huge glass 
chandelier hovers over the room.  A massive bronze sculpture of a wolf 
(done in the same style as the other sculptures) is perched in the 
balcony.  It seems to be howling out over the city which is seen in a 
spectacular view, spread out alonq the lakeshore below.

					CASANOVA
		This is where I come to... be alone.

He turns down the lights and quietly closes and locks the big door to 
the room.

CLOSE ON MONICA, sensing her danger.

					MONICA
		Oh, look at that view.

She moves out onto the balcony... as Casanova slips the gold chain from 
around his neck and follows her.

INT.  BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes have gathered around Furious, who sits in a chair, getting 
the third degree.

					HELLER
		Snap out of it!

					BOWLER
		Get on to yourself!

					SHOVELER
			(shouting right in his face)
		GET MAD!

					FURIOUS
		But I just don't feel it.

					RAJA
		He's turned into a completely normal person!

					FURIOUS
		Normal.  What's normal?  Does normal exist?  
		And if it did, how would we know it?

The Shoveler slugs him, sending him sprawling.

					FURIOUS
		You know, Eddie, that was really uncalled for.

EXT.  BALCONY ON FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - ON MONICA

gazing out onto the city, as she senses Casanova slinking up behind 
her.

					MONICA
		I'm chilly.

She turns, elegantly avoiding him, and moving back inside.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Spleen holds up Furious' favorite sunglasses.

					SPLEEN
		Look!  Your favorite sunglasses!
				(snaps them in two)

					BOWLER
		Your Roy Rogers coffee mug!
			(hurls it against the wall)

					SHOVELER
		Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
			    (breaks the head off it)

					FURIOUS
		Okay, you win.  I'm pissed off. I'm seriously 
		peeved.

The others groan with frustration.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica moves nervously around the room as Casanova sprawls languorously 
on the bed, toying with his gold chain.

					CASANOVA
		Come here.

					MONICA
		I'm not that kind of girl.

					CASANOVA
		Then why are you here?

					MONICA
		Curiosity.

					CASANOVA
				   (with a smile)
		Remember the cat.

Suddenly, he hears high heels in the hall.  A key is put in the lock--
Casanova leaps off the bed, grabs Monica and roughly shoves her into 
the closet.  He leaps back onto the bed, just as the door opens, and 
Anabel, dressed in a lab coat (and wearing high heels) enters.  
Casanova is completely relaxed, nonchalant.

					ANABEL
		What are you doing all alone in the dark?

					CASANOVA
		Fantasizing... about you.

She crosses the room to the wolf sculpture.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you were done?

					ANABEL
		One last tweak.

She opens a secret panel on its back, REVEALNG a FLASHING HIGH TECH 
INTERIOR... and Monica, watching from the closet, realizes that she has 
found the Psychostridulator.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON

a boom box... A CD jacket tells us that "Kenny G." is playing...

					RAJA
		If this doesn't do it, nothing will!

ON FURIOUS, a pair of headphones on his head.  The music is so loud 
that we can hear it even though it's being played only through the 
headphones.

ON THE OTHERS, gathered around him, waiting to see if this will work.  
And then Furious begins to respond... as his face turns into a 
contorted grimace.

					BOWLER
		It's working!

Furious groans and writhes... The others are thrilled; they've done it!

					FURIOUS
		This music is just SO BEAUTIFUL!

He starts to weep.  The others give a collective groan of defeat.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - COHTINUOUS

as Anabel works on the Psychostridulator, Monica looks at a clock... 
which reads almost eleven.  Time is running out.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CLOSE ON SHOVELER'S WRISTWATCH

which also reads eleven.

0N SHOVELER AND RAJA -

					SHOVELER
		It's time.

					RAJA
		With or without him, we gotta go!

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER -

as Anabel closes up the wolf... and starts to leave.

					ANABEL
		Our guests are waiting.

					CASANOVA
		I'll be down in a jiffy.

She goes out.  Casanova listens as the sound of high heels fades away, 
then he goes to the closet and lets Monica out.

					MONICA
		I'd better go.

					CASANOVA
		You're a spy.

					MONICA
				    (offguard)
		What?

					CASANOVA
		I saw him walk you home.

					MONICA
		Who?

					CASANOVA
		Roy.

She makes a sudden try for the door, but he blocks her way, a cold look 
in his eye that makes her step back in fear.

					CASANOVA
		Don't be afraid... I never hit a lady...

He lets the gold chain drop loose in his hand, then starts coming for 
her, a sadistic grin on his face.  This is the real Casanova.

Monica pulls back, then reaches into her purse and takes out A CANNED 
TORNADO, which she holds out threateningly.

					MONICA
		Stay away!

					CASANOVA
		Or you'll what?  CAN ME?

He laughs dementedly as Monica pops open the can and A SWIRLING FUNNEL 
OF AIR SHOOTS OUT OF IT and ENGULFS Casanova, throwing him across the 
room... Monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the 
door.

ON CASANOVA, pulling himself together.

					CASANOVA
		That bitch!

INT.  CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

as Monica runs for it, dialing the phone on the fly...

INT.  TEE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - ON THE PUONE

ringing... but no one is there...

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are climbing into the Herkimar, whose noisy idling engine 
obliterates the ringing of the phone.

					FURIOUS
		But she still might call!

					SHOVELER
		Are you coming or not?

					FURIOUS
		I'll drive.

					SHOVELER
		Not a chance!

He shoves him in the back, closing the heavy steel door behind him.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON MONICA

hiding behind a large planter... listening to the phone ringing on the 
other end.

					MONICA
		Come on, guys... Pick up... 

Suddenly, we hear Casanova's voice on the line.

				CASANOVA'S VOICE
		What's the matter...

BACK IN THE TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is listening in on another phone.

					CASANOVA
		Nobody home?

BACK TO M0NICA - CONTINUOUS

as she moves quickly down the hall.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is at the wheel.  The Raja sits in the passenger seat.  
The others are in the back.

					SHOVELER
		Here we go!

He forces the stick into gear and the Herkimer lurches forward.

					SHOVELER
		We've got lift off!

					RAJA
		May the forks be with us!

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer--backfiring, smoking, clanging--rumbles down the 
driveway into action.

BACK IN THE HERKINER - CONTINUOUS

Shoveler tries to put the car in second gear, but it won't go. He yanks 
and pulls and struggles, until the stick comes off in his hand.

					RAJA
		First is good.

INT.  CORRIDOR IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova instructs three security guards.

					CASANOVA
		I want her alive.

					GUARDS
		Yes, Mr. Frankenstein.

CAMERA PANS UP the top of a staircase... where Monica is crouched, 
listening.

EXT.  STREETS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS as the Herkimer rumbles and smokes down Champion's main 
street (in first gear) and the citizens step out of houses and bars to 
watch this bizarre sight.

ON A LITTLE BOY AND HIS FATHER -

					LITTLE BOY
		Daddy, what is that thing?

					FATHER
		I don't know, son.

A couple of GRIZZLED CHARACTERS stand in front of a bar.

					DRUNK
		A Herkimer?  Those yuppies will drive anything.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

ON FURIOUS AND THE OTHERS in the back.

					SPHINX
		Amigo, we need you.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Just GET MAD!

Furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.

INT.  V.I.P. LOUNGE IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

A sumptuous, hotel-like lounge.  Anabel is holding court with all of 
top crooks from the luncheon, charrning the pants off them... Casanova 
slithers up behind her.

					CASANOVA
		Fellas, this is woman without whom I would have 
		gone sane.
				(kisses her neck)

EXT.  FRONT GATE OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

A pair of security guards (the same two who got gassed by the Spleen) 
are on duty, when they see... a strange looking vehicle chugging up the 
hill straight for them.

					GUARD 1
		What the hell is that?

					GUARD 2
		Looks like... a Ford Dumpster.

They have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to 
stop...  But the Herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates 
and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.

					GUARDS
		HEY!

They open fire.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Bullets are heard pinging off the Herk as THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD just 
ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art 
center.

					SHOVELER
		Hang on!

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Several more guards open fire, as the Herkimer hits the stairs and 
starts bouncing up them...

BACK AT THE LOUNGE - ON CASANOVA

checking his watch.

					CASANOVA
		It's showtime.

But then they all hear... the sound of gunfire.

					TONY P
		What's that?

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer chugs and bounces... toward the entrance of the center.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes get bounced all over the place.

as guards close and bolt the big wooden doors to the art center.

ON A GUARD wearing a headset.

INT.  SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova sits at a security console.  Anabel, Tony P, and the top 
crooks stand behind him, listening.

					CASANOVA
		By whom?

					VOICE OF GUARD
		We don't know!

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer climbs to the top, then rams into the doors with a 
thud.  But the doors hold.

BACK ON THE VILLAINS -

					TONY P
		They'll never get through those doors.

BACK AT THE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

But the plucky little Herkimer digs in its rear wheels and pushes 
against the doors like the Little Engine That Could...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes encourage the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Come on, baby!

					BOWLER
		Do it, big boy!

ON ITS WHEELS, grinding, chewing up the concrete...

as the Herkimer comes crunching through the big wooden doors of the 
center, scattering the guards.

BACK INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

our heroes cheer, pat the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Atta, girl!

					BOWLER
		Atta, boy!

BACK TO CASANOVA -

watching on a security monitor

					VOICE OF GUARD
		Mr. Frankenstein, they're in!

					CASANOVA
		Well kill them.

BACK IN THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

The Herkimer drives into the main hall of the center as a small army of 
security guards swarms in, guns blazing.

BACK AT THE SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and the crooks watch the security monitor...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the Herk as 
our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle...The Sphinxs puts on 
his mask... the Bowler unzips her bag...Doc Heller cocks his air 
cannon... Spleen and Invisible Boy load a bag with canned tornadoes... 
While Mister Furious watches anxiously.

The Shoveler drives intently, bullets splattering like bugs on the 
windshield.

					SHOVELER
		Where am I going?

					RAJA
			(pointing to an archway on the
				other side of the hall)
		Through there!

					SHOVELER
		Right.

But suddenly something under the hood blows up; the engine gives a long 
groan, and the Herkimer rolls to a dead stop...

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE HERIKINER - CONTINUOUS

Right in the middle, in the most exposed position of the main hall.  
More guards arrive and open fire... An armored golf cart with a fifty 
caliber machine gun mounted on it comes speeding into the hall, 
blasting the Herk...

Inside, the sound of the big bullets is deafening as Shoveler tries to 
restart the engine.

					SHOVELER
		No good!  She's dead!

ON CASANOVA AND THE CROOKS, watching the monitor and laughing as 
bullets pulverize the Herk.

					TONY P
		Spam in a can!

The crooks laugh.

Butsuddenly, the Herkimer's door is thrown open, revealing our heroes--
holding down Doc Heller, his air cannon at the ready. He fires--there 
is a WHOOMPH of air--and the mounted gun and a dozen guards are sent 
tumbling...

SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA AND THE OTHERS

watching, sobered.

BACK IN THE MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes come charging out of the Herkimer, using their various 
skills to blow through the surprised guards.  Mr. Furious comes out 
last, not quite sure what to do with himself.

But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid 
down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony 
overlooking the floor.  Bullets splatter all around them--and several 
unlucky guards are hit--but our heroes dive for cover. The Raja tries 
to get off a fork, but the firing is too intense.  Our heroes are 
pinned down.

ON MR. FURIOUS as he sees... the bag of canned tornadoes. He's got no 
superpowers, and he's scared to death, but he grabs a canned tornado.

					FURIOUS
		Cover me!

					SHOVELER
		With what?

Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but 
impressive) zig-zag pattern across the floor... He performs a wild 
somersault, comes up on his feet, pops open the can, and executes a 
perfect jump shot, lobbing it right into the balcony.  The tornado 
funnels out, and the guards are sent flying.

ON CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS watching...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
		Who are those guys?

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, who knows who they are.

WHILE BACK IN THE HALL our heroes rally around a shaken Mr. Furious.

					RAJA
		Not bad for a normal guy!

					SPHINX
		Amigos!

					ALL
		Do or die!

EXT.  COURTYARD - A MOMENT LATER - ANGLE ON

the security eye watching...

as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

as he types something into the security computer...

ON THE SCREEN a computerized image of the eye appears. Casanova 
highlights the word "Activate" and then presses "Enter".

BACK TO THE COURTYARD - ON THE EYE

as it comes to glowing, sinister life...

A hapless guard retreats under the arch--the Eye instantly focuses on 
him, and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams... that SIZZLE 
HIM...

A moment later our heroes arrive at the arch.  Furious is about to run 
through, but Doc Heller holds him back.

					HELLER
		Wait!  Look!

He points to... a man shaped pile of charcoal, all that remains of the 
unfortunate guard.

					HELLER
		Laser eye... and it's a humdinger.

					RAJA
		No problem.

The Raja takes out a butter knife, aims, and hurls it straight at the 
eye, but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into... 
a formless blob of silver.

BACK TO CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS -

					TONY P
		We'll take care of these clowns.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Piece a cake.

					BONE HEAD LEADER
		No sweat.

CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

as Tony P, the top crooks, and the Disco Boys march en masse TOWARD THE 
CAMAERA... They are an ugly, formidable looking bunch.

EXT.  COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are blocked by the eye.

					SHOVELER
		Doc, there's got to be a way.

But the Doc is stymied... Suddenly they hear a woman's voice calling 
down to them.

					MONICA'S VOICE
		It's up here!  It's up here!

					FURIOUS
				     (looks up)
		Monica!

EXT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica leans over the edge of the balcony, the wolf sculpture looming 
over her, shouting down at them.

					MONICA
		ROY!  THE PSYCHO THING IS--!

But strong hands suddenly grab her.  It's Casanova.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as high above he hears Monica scream.

BACK TO THE BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova, hand held tightly across Monica's mouth, shouts down 
tauntingly to Furious.

					CASANOVA
		Thanks, Roy!  She's just my type. You can have 
		her back... when I'm done!

BACK T0 FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as he hears Casanova's evil laugh and Monica's scream.  He is desperate 
to find a way up, but the wall is completely sheer. He feels helpless-
frantic, near tears...

FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' 
car, crying, pounding on the windows...

And then... Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up--
and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage. His button has 
finally been pressed.  Be's MAD!  He reaches up as high as he can...

CLOSE ON HIS HAND -

as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall... and he 
pulls himself up.

BACK AT THE TOP 0F THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova throws Monica onto the bed, puts his hands on her throat and 
strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength.

BACK TO FURIOUS -

Fifty feet up and climbing.  He pulls himself up, one hand, then 
another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny 
cracks he can find... as the others gaze up at him.

					HELLER
		He'll never make it.

					BOWLER
		Think positive.

Meanwhile, Invisible Boy stands staring at the security eye, a look of 
fierce determination on his face.  This is his moment.

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(to himself)
		I can do it.

He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates...

ON FURIOUS as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold 
gives way... For a desperate moment, Furious is dangling off the wall 
by the tips of the fingers of one hand. Only his incredible rage keeps 
his fingertips taut.

Suddenly, there is a flash of silver, and a large cake fork embeds in 
the concrete not far from his head.  Furious grabs hold of it, and 
throws a grateful look down to the Raja...

Who salaams up at him...

As Invisible Boy, eyes closed in concentration, walks very slowly, 
hands at his sides, in an almost Egyptian pose... toward the eye... 
which stares down mercilessly, waiting for its next victim...

we notice that Invisible Boy has become... just slightly transparent.

AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles Monica.  Her resistance 
fades.  Her hands fall away.  She is pale, beautiful, almost gone, a 
picture of exquisite death.

					CASANOVA
				   (admiring her)
		Some girls just know how to die.

Suddenly, we hear someone cursing Casanova in Russian. He turns and 
sees... Anabel standing there, pistol in hand.

					ANABEL
		You two timing psychotic bastard.

					CASANOVA
		Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

					ANABEL
				(aiming at his heart)
		Do I?

					CASANOVA
		I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women.  
		It doesn't mean a thing.
				(moving toward her, turning on
				that old Frankenstein Charm)
		Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our 
		night.  It's what we've lied for... cheated 
		for... murdered for.  She's just a plaything, a 
		trifle... You're the only woman who's ever 
		meant anything to me. I adore you.  I worship 
		you.  I want to make you my bride.

She succumbs to his charms, and he gently takes the pistol out of her 
hand.

					CASANOVA
		There's just one thing...
				(with a psychotic smile)
		I don't need you anymore.

A look of terror comes across her face as she sees the murder in his 
eyes.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Darling.  I never hit a lady.

EXT.  ON THE WALL - A MOMENT LATER - ON FURIOUS

still climbing as he hears a scream, looks up... and sees Anabel go 
plummeting past him.

ON OUR HEROES down below.

					BOWLER
		Heads up!

CAMERA HOLDS ON OUR HEROES, wincing as Anabel hits with an ugly thud.

Suddenly they hear Invisible Boy calling to them.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Guys, I did it! I did it!  I'm invisible!

They all turn and see... Invisible Boy, totally visible, but standing 
on the other side of the arch.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Can you see me?

					ALL
		Yes!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Nuts.

					SHOVELER
		Kid, turn that thing off!

Invisible Boy turns and sees... a computer screen built into the wall 
(with the same image of the eye on it that was on Casanova's computer), 
but he doesn't have a clue how to turn it off.  Suddenly, he hears 
running feet, turns and sees...

The top crooks and the Disco Boys rushing towards him through the giant 
sculptures.  He gets an idea... and stands right in front of the 
computer screen.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		HEY! CREEPS!

He makes a face at them--and a dozen guns are instantly fired at him.  
He jumps clear behind a pillar--as the bullets smash into the wall... 
one of them demolishing the computer screen.

CLOSE ON THE EYE -

as it goes dead.

ON INVISIBLE BOY, hiding behind the pillar... realizing he's been shot 
in the shoulder.

BACK ON OUR HEROES -

					SHOVELER
		This is it!  DO OR DIE!

The villains form a line, bristling with pistols... as our heroes, led 
by Sphinx, Shoveler, and Bowler come running through the arch.  The 
threesome go shoulder to shoulder (with our other heroes right behind 
them) as the villains open fire, laying down a deadly fusillade...

ON SHOVELER, BOWLER, AND SPHINX, standing together, deflecting their 
bullets with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... (as they practiced 
with pebbles at the farm)... with the Raja right behind them, hurling 
silverware...

ON THE VILLAINS, rapid firing... but their own bullets ricochet back 
into them, dropping them... They start to fall back.

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is about to finish Monica.

					CASANOVA
		And the light goes out...

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Frankenstein!

Casanova turns and sees... Furious, standing on the balcony.

					CASANOVA
		Roy... What took you so long?

Furious starts at Casanova, who aims Anabel's pistol at him. Furious 
hesitates.

					CASANOVA
		Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.

					FURIOUS
		They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

Furious lunges at Casanova--who gets off a shot before Furious grabs 
the gun out of his hand.  Casanova ducks clear.  Furious tosses the 
pistol away... then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.

					CASANOVA
		Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance?

He turns on his stereo and the sound of DISCO MUSIC fills the air...

INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

Downstairs, the villains have regrouped.

					TONY P
		Let's rush 'em!

They charge en mass at our heroes... who are waiting for them... 
pinching their noses closed, the Spleen bent over at their forefront...

While Casanova dances around Furious like a cat... Furious, fighting 
the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and Casanova neatly 
sidesteps him...

The crooks and Disco Boys fall back, gasping, choking in the noxious 
fumes...

As Casanova attacks...

Advancing shoulder to shoulder, fighting as a team, our heroes wield 
machete, fork, shovel, bowling ball, and canned tornado... forcing the 
villains back...

Casanova comes at Furious relentlessly, kicking and spinning...  and 
Furious gets the worst of it.

Suddenly, a squad of Disco Boys comes charging at our heroes from the 
flank... but Doc Heller turns to face them, shrinker spray held Rambo-
style on his hip.  He lets them have it, blasting them with a DENSE 
BLUE SPRAY...

When the spray clears, the D Boys lie squirming on the floor, prisoners 
in their now child sized disco suits...

					DISCO BOYS
		Help!... Get me out of this!
				        (Etc.)

Upstairs, Casanova pummels Furious...

While, downstairs, the Shoveler dispatches the Elvis Brothers with some 
nifty shovel work... But suddenly, the Bland Boys, pistols blazing, are 
advancing on him, forcing him back against the base of a sculpture.  
But the Raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.

					RAJA (0.S.)
		Gentlemen!

The Bland Boys look up and see... the Raja, both hands filled with 
silverware... which he HURLS...

A beat later the Bland Boys, bristling with forks and grapefruit 
spoons, run screaming through the sculptures... as Tony P, pistol in 
hand, skulks out from behind a sculpture and spots... the Bowler.

Upstairs, Furious goes flying against a wall...

					CASANOVA
		Roy, you're making this too easy.

As Tony P takes a careful bead on the Bowler.

					TONY P
		Say hello to Daddy for me!

He opens fire, but she goes instantly into her ball svinging frenzy... 
He fires, missing--she's too fast to keep a bead on... Finally, his gun 
clicks empty.  She turns and faces him.

					BOWLER
				     (grimly)
		Daddy says hello.

She HURLS the ball at him--like a fiery softball pitch.

BALL'S POV -

going straight for Tony P's SCREAMING head...

ON THE BOWLER, watching--as Tony's scream is cut short by a gruesose 
thud.

Back upstairs Casanova cornmes at Furious again... but Furious ducks 
the kick, pops back up and smashes Casanova with his good arm... 
sending him flying across the room... Casanova recovers.

					CASANOVA
		Let's change the tune.

He reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device (that Anabel 
used at the luncheon).  He presses a button...

ON THE WOLF SCULPTURE as the jaws open, its eyes glow red... and the 
dreadful sound of the Psychostridulator grinds up and FILLS THE NIGHT 
AIR LIKE A SIREN.

Downstairs, the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and the 
villains all go into a full blown psychotic episode... The villains 
start shooting and stabbing each other.

SERIES OF SHOTS - AROUND THE CITY - CONTINUOUS

On Main Street cars slam into each other.  Pedestrians start screaming 
and fightinq... A man and his dog snarl and snap at each other...

The Customers at the Lakeside Diner go insane, hurling plates and 
food...

At the Shoveler's house the kids turn psycho in front of the 
television...

ANGLE ON A TYPICAL SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -

as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be 
heard coming from all the houses...

LONG ANGLE OF CHAMPION CITY -

as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

in full psychotic ecstasy...

					CASANOVA
		WHAT A RUSH!
			(tosses the remote off the balcony)

ON MONICA, still motionless on the bed...

Casanova and Furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a 
contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength... Casanova gets 
his hands around Furious's throat and crushes it... Furious drops to 
his knees, and Casanova thinks he's got him.  But Furious, grimacing 
with rage, looks him right in the eye.

					FURIOUS
				   (raspy voiced)
		Is... that... all you got?

Furious grabs Casanova's wrists... and crushes them.  Casanova howls 
with pain, loses his grip.  Furious slugs him, again and again... then 
he grabs Casanova by the belt, swings him around, and HURLS him into 
the air...

Casanova CRASHES into the huge crystal chandelier--there is an 
explosion of crystal and glass.  Furious averts his eyes as cut glass 
rains down all around him... then he looks up and sees...

Casanova's gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier.  
Casanova kicks and flails... as he is hanged by the neck on his own 
gold chain...

Furious moves to the wolf sculpture.  Be PLUNGES HIS HAND through its 
bronze casing, and RIPS OUT the heart of the Psychostridulator, a 
flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but 
higher pitched and more irritating sound...

Furious HURLS the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a 
thousand pieces...

CLOSE ON ONE OF THE PIECES -

In insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched, even more 
disorienting sound.  This is the very nerve center of the 
Psychostridulator...

Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel...

SILENCE...

Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted... He looks up... at 
Casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...

					FURIOUS
		Nice dancing with you.

SERIES OF SHOTS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished 
crooks... the traumatized reunants of whom run for it. Things also 
return to normal...

On the street...

At the Lakeside Diner...

And at the Shoveler's house...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Furious moves to the bed, where Monica lies motionless and pale...

					FURIOUS
		Monica...

He touches her face, her eyes open, and she looks at him.

					MONICA
		You're beautiful when you're angry.

He takes her tenderly in his arm... as the Raja, the Shoveler and the 
others rush into the room and see... Furious and Monica embracing.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A LITTLE LATER

Police cars and news vans arrive... as our heroes, battered, wounded, 
but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs...

Furious and Monica hold each other up.  Wounded Invisible Boy has his 
arm around the Spleen... while policemen and news people run up the 
stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...

But this time our heroes could care less.  They are superheroes, and 
they don't give a damn who knows it.

INT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

as the Raja opens the door and enters...

					RAJA
		Mama!

She is there, waiting up for him.

					RAJA
		I'm home.

They embrace.

INT. SHOVELER'S DOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

Don Stouffer is reporting.

					DON
		Few details have emerged...

ON THE SHOVELER'S KIDS, on the couch, still rattled by their psychotic 
episode, glued to the TV -

					DON (0.S.)
		...but the Dawn Patrol got this exclusive 
		interview vith two of the suspects.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong interviews the battered, handcuffed Elvis Brothers as they 
are led away...

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		I don't know who those guys were--but I never 
		want to see 'em again.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Especially that big dude with the shovel...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
					 (near tears)
		He was the worst!

ON THE KIDS' COLLECTIVE REACTION as they realize who it was... and then 
they hear the front door open...

In the front hall the Shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his 
back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.

					KIDS
		Dad!... Dad!... You okay?... You hurt?

					SHOVELER
			   (shocked by this welcome)
		I'm okay--I'm all right.

					EDDIE JR.
		Lean on me, Dad.

					LENORE
		I'll hold your shovel, Dad.

They lead him back into the living room, and give him the prime spot on 
the couch.

					BUTCH
		You want a soda, Dad?

					SHOVELER
					(stunned)
		Okay.

He runs to get it as Eddie Jr. slides a footstool under his feet and 
Tracy puts a pillow behind his back.  Roland, the little one, cuddles 
up next to him, puts his arm around him.

					ROLAND
		Nice work. Dad.

					SHOVELER
		Thanks, Roland.

					ROLAND
		You really are a superhero, aren't you?

The Shoveler nods.  A few minutes later... The Shoveler sits on the 
couch, feet up, soda in hand. The television is off. His kids all 
huddled around him, hanging on his every word.

					SHOVELER
		And that's when the engine blew up.

					KIDS
		Whoa...

					BUTCH
		What did you do?

					SHOVELER
		Well...

ON LUCILLE as she comes in and sees... her husband surrounded by his 
kids, a happy man at last.

EXT.  LAKESIDE DINER - THE NEXT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

INT. THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - ON THE SPLEEN

sitting between the Bowler and a bandaged Invisible Boy. The Bowler has 
her arm chummily around the Spleen's shoulder. The Spleen finally has 
real friends. Doc Heller discusses the art of fork throwing with the 
Raja as the Shoveler listens in. The Sphinx sits at the end of the 
table, silent.

					DOC HELLER
		So you're never actually conscious of range or 
		trajectory?

					RAJA
		Heck no.  I just chuck 'em.

Monica (in her waitress outfit) sits close to a bandaged Mister 
Furious.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong reports.

					DAWN
		It's been twenty-four hours since the deadly 
		psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that 
		left Casanova Frankenstein and dozen of the 
		city's top hoodlums dead... But tonight the 
		question remains... Who were these heroic 
		mystery men who saved our city?...

ON OUR HEROES -

					BOWLER
		Could have been anybody.

They laugh.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute... That's it.  That's our name.  
		We're... the Mystery Men.

They all like it, except for the Bowler.

					BOWLER
		Hey, do I look like a Man?

					SHOVELER
		Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

					SPLEEN
			(singing, ala "Macho Man")
		Mystery, Mystery Man... I want to be a Mystery 
		Man...

		  		  SHOVELER & RAJA
		Shut up.

					BOWLER
		Eat your mustard.

					FURIOUS
		It doesn't matter what we call ourselves.  We 
		know who we are.

					RAJA
		Yes, Obie-wan.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Hey... he's gone.

The others see... that the Sphinx's chair is empty.  Raja spots a 
crumpled napkin on the table, opens it up, and reads.

					RAJA
		"Until you need me again... Adios."

A silence... Reactions from our heroes as they realize that the Sphinx 
is gone...

					SHOVELER
		I miss him already.

Suddenly, somewhere in the night, a burst of gunfire and screams are 
heard.  THE FINAL MUSIC BEGINS...

					FURIOUS
		Amigos, duty calls.

The Mystery Men wolf their burgers, then stand and start for the 
street...

As Monica watches them leave, a PATRON asks her:

					PATRON
		Miss... who are those guys?

					MONICA
				(after a moment)
		I don't know.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - A MOMENT LATER

HEROIC GROUP SHOT as the Mystery Men merch down the middle of street, 
toward the sound of the gunfire... and into the night.

 This Script was transcribed by AranMax at The Neverending Story Page.
 
 
 
 

 
 THE NEVERENDING STORY   Based on the book by Michael Ende Screenplay by Wolfgang Peterson 1984   FADE IN:   Limahls The Neverending Story plays as the CREDITS PLAY OVER a dazzling display of some great clouded storm. THE NOTHING. Great masses of clouds swirl and churn and collide on the screen.             As the FINAL CREDITS play we   CUT TO: Bastians bedroom   Our story begins as our young friend awakes from a dream. Bastian quickly sits up as if awakening from a nightmare. He looks at a picture of his mom with a sigh and then he picks up the book beside him and marks his spot.   CUT TO: Kitchen.   Bastians father is working on some sort of concoction in the kitchen blender, while Bastian sits at the dining table straining to open jelly for his toast. They exchange a good morning between each other, but they are relatively quiet.   Father: Morning Bastian   Bastian: Morning Dad   Bastian continues to struggle with the jar until his hand hurts. His father turns to him and gives him a hand. He seems to easily open the jar. As Bastians father returns to his task of the morning drink concoction Bastian breaks the silence.   Bastian: I had another dream Dad, about Mom.   His father pauses at the blender, but doesn't look at him and then he continues creating his drink.   Father: I understand son, but we have to get on with things, right? (Bastian looks dejected at this answer.) Bastian we each have responsibilities. We can't let Mom's death be an excuse for not getting the old job done, right ?   Bastian half-heartedly smears butter on his toast. His father approaches the table and sits down. Time for a father to son talk.   Father: Son, I think it's time you and I had a little talk. I got a call from your math teacher yesterday. She says you were drawing horses in your math book.   Bastian: Unicorns. They were unicorns.(mimics a unicorn)   Father: What ?   Bastian: Nothing.   Father:             She also says that you haven't been turning your homework       in on time. And I'm very disappointed you didn't even try out for           the swim-team.           ( Pause )         As for those riding lessons you've been wanting                                you say you love horses yet you seem to be afraid to get on a real                          one. Now, Bastian, you're old enough to get your head out of the                             clouds and start keeping both feet on the ground. Alright ?                                                         (he takes a sip of drink.)   Bastian: Ok.   Father: Stop daydreaming and start facing your problems.                  Ok ? (ruffles Bastians hair)   Bastian: Ok (he says with a half hearted smile)   Father:                                             Ok. Right I think we've had a nice little talk we should have more. (he gulps down his drink and gets up to leave.) Have a nice day and don't be late to school again.   Bastian: (Bastian turns to him) But yesterday I wasn't   END SCENE   FADE IN: City street   Out on the street 3 bullies are laughing. As Bastian walks out, they stop.   Bully 1: Hey look it's the weirdo.   Bully 2: Hey weirdo, got any cash for us today ?   Bastian turns and runs.   Bully 1: Hey follow! That's it weirdo. You can't get away               you jerk ! You're dead chicken!   They yell chasing after him. They chase him down an alley where they corner him and catch him.   Bully 3: Where's you're money man ?   Bastian: I don't have any!   Bully 1:      No money? Momma's little boy is holding out     on us. You ain't got any money on ya, you go in the garbage can   All three bullies shove Bastian into a nearby dumpster.   Bully 3: Maybe chicken can lay an egg in there. (They laugh as they return to the street.)     Bastian comes out of the dumpster and enters the street brushing garbage off himself. The bullies see him and stand up straight.   Bully 1:              style="mso-spacerun: yes">                  Hey man, who said you could get out of the garbage ? Get back in there. class=MsoBodyText2>  (They smile at each other and start towards him.)   Bastian: Oh no not again. No not again! (He starts running)   Bully 2: Where do you think you're going wimp? (They chase after him, He ducks into a bookstore and the boys run by. )   NEXT SCENE: Coreanders Book store   Bastian watches from inside the store as the three bullies go running by. He sighs felling relief, but is suddenly startled by a ruff bulldog voice from somewhere in the store.   Coreander: Get outta here. I don't like kids.   Bastian walks toward the area he heard to voice from, and finds an old man siting in a chair reading. He turns and looks at him.   Coreander: You still here boy? Didn't you hear what I said?   Bastian: Um, I was.. (he stutters motioning to the door.)   Coreander: You're hiding aren't you?   Bastian: No I was just... (he stutters more)   Coreander: The video arcade is down the street . Here we just sell small rectangular objects that are called books. Require a little effort on your part and make no b..b..b..beeps. On your way please     Bastian: I KNOW books. I have 186 of them at home!   Coreander: Bah. Comic books.   Bastian: No. I've read Treasure Island, Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz, Lord of the Rings, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan   Coreander: Whoa whoa whoa. Who are you running away from? (he says with new interest.)   Bastian: Just some kids from school.   Coreander: Why ?   Bastian: They wanna throw me in the garbage.   Coreander: Why don't you give them a good punch in the nose, eh?   Bastian: Oh, I dunno.(he looks down at his shoes)     The man turns away from him again. Bastian looks at the book he has. His interest has been aroused.   Bastian: What's that book about?   Coreander: Oh, this is something special.   Bastian: (Bastian moves in closer.) Well, what is it ?   Coreander: Look. You're books are safe. While you're reading them you get to become Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.   Bastian: But that's what I like about them.   Coreander: Yes, but afterwards you get to be a little boy again.   Bastian: What do you mean?   Coreander: Listen (he motions for him to come nearer.)   Coreander: Have you ever been Captain Nemo, trapped inside your submarine while the giant squid was attacking you ?   Bastian: Yes.   Coreander: Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape ?   Bastian: But it's only a story.   Coreander: That's what I'm talking about. The ones you read are safe.   Bastian: And that one isn't ?   Coreander: Don't worry about it.   Bastian: But, but you just said it was.... (the phone rings and Coreander puts the book under a newspaper to try and hide it.)   Coreander: Forget about it. This book is not for you. (he gets up and gets the phone.)    Bastian watches him. As he talks on the phone Bastian uncovers the book. The title on the book reads, The Neverending Story. above these words is a symbol on the cover. The symbol is two snakes intertwined with each other and biting each other's tail. As the old man hangs up the phone, Bastian grabs the book and runs out. The old man smiles to himself and looks down at his desk proud to have finally gotten rid of the annoying child.   ANGLE: Coreanders desk   On his desk in place of the book is a note pad barely legible writing on it, it reads: class=MsoBodyText2>  " Don't worry, I'll return your book."   END SCENE   NEXT SCENE: Bastians school.   With the book under his shirt Bastian runs through the hall of his school. He stops outside his classroom, then cautiously looks through the small slit of a window in the classroom door. What he sees is his class already started on a very important math test. class=MsoBodyText2>  Bastian: The Math test, oh no.   CUT TO: school attic   Bastian runs up the stairs leading to the  school's attic, finds the key and goes inside. There are all sorts of old scholastic objects in the attic. He finds a stack of old gym mats and pulls one out. He sits down and pulls out the book, then he begins reading.   ANGLE- Bastian- CLOSE UP:   Bastian: It was midnight in the Howling forest. The wind whistled through the tops of the ancient trees. Suddenly, something enormous crashed and rumbled through the eerie woods.   FADE OUT TO: Fantasia   WIDE SHOT: View of small camp.    We see a snail look up and there's a small man beside him. There is a Nighthob and his sleeping bat nearby. Suddenly the calm of the camp is interrupted by a great rumbling similar to an earthquake.   Nighthob: What's that ?  (the ground shakes.)   ANGLE: Rockbiter   A huge tricycle comes to a stop in front of them. It is made entirely from stone, as is the giant riding it. The Rockbiter speaks to them in a deep, friendly voice.   Rockbiter:  Excuse me, would it be alright if I joined you this evening?   Tiny:                       Uh huh. .   Rockbiter:  You see I've been traveling all day.   (he climbs off his tricycle.He rolls it backward and then sits down. The ground beneath him shakes. He sniffs the air and then says, as if he has discovered a secret of theirs)    Ah hah ! Now I see why you picked this camp. "   He picks up a large rock and sniffs it.   Rockbiter:  A delicious looking limestone rock. Nice bouquet, must be a real vintage here.   Nighthob:  Yes, you're right. Those delicious rocks are the reason we camped here alright.   Then he runs over to the little man.   Nighthob:            Psst. is he a nutcase?   Tiny:                          No, he's a Rockbiter.   Nighthob:      Oh a Rockbiter. A Rockbiter!?     The Rockbiter starts eating the limestone he is holding. Pieces fall all over the place. One piece falls on the snail.   Rockbiter: Ooops, sorry.   Then he burps.   Oh, pardon me !     Nighthob:  Pardoned.   Rockbiter: Mmm. That was limestone, with a dash of quartz. Very tasty. Where I come from in the north we used to have exquisite gourmet rocks, only now...now they're all gone.   Nighthob:       Huh, I know how it happened.     The Rockbiter makes a boyscouts honor sign.   Rockbiter: I swear it wasn't me.   Nighthob: Hah ! Heck no.   Tiny: I think I know what it was, tell us more.   Rockbiter: Near my home there used to be a beautiful lake, but then it was gone.   Tiny:  Did the lake dry up?         Rockbiter: No, it just wasn't there anymore. Nothing was there anymore. Not even a dried up lake.     Tiny:  A hole ?   Rockbiter:  No, a hole would be something. Nah, it was nothing. And it got bigger and bigger. First there was no lake anymore and then finally, no rocks.   Nighthob:  Hah! If he keeps stuffing his face like that, soon there won't be any rocks left here either!    (Nighthob complains to the little man. As he starts to walk away, the little man grabs him.)   Tiny: Nighthob, this could be serious!   Rockbiter, what you have told us is also occurring where I live in the west ! A strange sort of Nothing is destroying everything.   Nighthob: Yes, we Nighthobs live in the south. And it's there too. . Rockbiter: So, so it's not just in our part of Fantasia?   Nighthob:  Maybe, it's already everywhere...   (Nighthob hisses looking around suspiciously smelling the air.)   Maybe our whole land is in danger. What can we do?   Rockbiter:  My people are sending me to the Ivory Tower, to the Empress for help   Nighthob and Tiny:  We are..   Tiny:  We are on the same mission. After all, if the Empress can't save us, who could?   Nighthob:  Then why are we all just standing around here instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?   Tiny:  Right, what are we waiting for ?     The little man climbs on his snail while the Nighthob tries to wake up his bat. Nighthob: Hey wake up! We can't just hang around here. Prepare for take off! Stupid bat!   Rockbiter:  We, we can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?   Tiny:  Don't worry, it's a racing snail.     Rockbiter: Oh, but we can't even wait for a racing snail.   The little man goes peddling off on the snail. Nighthob finally wakes up his bat and climbs on as   Rockbiter:          It really is a racing snail.   Nighthob: And nobody gives a hoot about me and my stupid bat.   CLOSE UP: Rockbiter Rockbiter: Maybe I'll take a few of these yummy gourmet rocks, eh.. for the road. class=MsoBodyText2>  class=MsoBodyText2>  class=MsoBodyText2>  As he bends down to pick some up, he stands straight up again and realizes he hears the nothing coming.             style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Rockbiter:  Oh no. The nothing! class=MsoBodyText2>  CUT TO: A golden sunset   View of the sky and Nighthob on his bat.   Nighthob:  Look there it is. The heart of Fantasia.             View of Rockbiter and little man. They stop as they see the Ivory Tower.   Rockbiter:  I never knew it was that beautiful. Oh.   EXT. VIEW-Ivory Tower   Wide angled view of the nearing Ivory Tower. It shimmers in its only light as the sun sets behind it. class=MsoBodyText2>  Nighthob:  Stay awake. I told you to stay awake.   We span the whole length of this Ivory Tower. It is said to be as big as a city. We pass over the base of the tower, then its mid section, and finally we near the very top of the structure. It is very intricate here. We begin to zoom in on the Magnolia pavilion. The very tip of the Ivory Tower, the place that the Empress lives.     Nighthob:      The home of the Empress. She's our only hope.   FADE OUT:   INT. VIEW- Ivory Tower- The Empresses court   The door to the Empress's room opens into the courtyard. Lots of creatures from Fantasia await help from the Empress. The Empress's head servant comes out of her room and speaks to them all.   Carion:  Friends, I know why you are all here. The nothing is destroying our world. I also know that you have come to beseech the Empress for help. But I, I have terrible news. The Empress herself has become deathly ill. There seems to be a mysterious link between her illness and the nothing. She is dying. So she cannot save us...   There is much commotion among the creatures gathered there, but he continues.                But there just might be one chance. The plains people who  hunt the purple buffalo have among them a great warrior and he alone has a chance to fight the nothing and save us. He is our only hope. His name is Atreyu.   CUT TO: School attic- Bastian   View of Bastian. He looks up from the book and grabs his school bag. He looks at the Indians on the front.   Bastian:  Atreyu..   Bastian: The Empress had already sent for the great warrior. When he finally            style="mso-spacerun: yes">              appeared on the terrace of the Ivory Tower, he carried with him the hopes of all            Fantasia."   View of a young Indian boy walking up the stairs to the old man.   Bastian:  A little boy   Close up of Atreyu as the old man speaks to him.   Carion: I'm sorry, but this is not the time nor place for children. I must ask you to leave.   Atreyu:  If you don't want me here, you shouldn't have sent for me.   Carion:  It was not you we sent for. We wanted Atreyu.   Atreyu:  I am Atreyu.   Carion Not Atreyu the child, Atreyu the warrior.   Atreyu:  I am the only Atreyu with the plains people, but I'll be happy to go back to hunting the purple buffalo.    Carion:        No wait !   Atreyu pauses as the old man continues..    Come back please.   Atreyu walks back up the stairs. The old man looks at him more urgently now.   Carion:  If you truly are the Atreyu we sent for, you                                                          would be willing to go on a quest?   Atreyu:  Yes of course, what kind of a quest?   Carion:  To find a cure for the Empress .....and to save our world. No one can give you any advice except this, you must go alone and you must leave all your weapons behind. It will be very dangerous.   Atreyu:  Is there any chance of success?   Carion:  I do not know, but if you fail the Empress will surely die and our whole world will be destroyed.   Atreyu's eyes grow large and he closes them and hangs his head down. Then he opens them back up and looks at the old man determinedly. He takes off his bow and quiver of arrows.   Atreyu:  When do I begin ?    Carion:  Now and you must hurry Atreyu, the nothing grows stronger everyday.     He motions him to come nearer. Carion:  Take this. (He holds up a necklace that has the same symbol as the front of the book. He fastens it on Atreyu.)   " The Auryn" Could be heard whispered throughout the court filled with creatures.   Carion:  He who wears the Auryn speaks for the Empress. It will guide and protect you.   END SCENE: view of Atreyu and his horse galloping away from the ivory tower. Fade out   FADE IN: Dark cave   View of a dark cave and we hear   Bastian:  At the same time, elsewhere in Fantasia, a creature of darkness also began his quest.   We see two evil eyes open abruptly followed by a horrid howl in the cave and then a wolf as black as night runs out.   CUT TO: Atreyu & Artax   View of Atreyu and Artax near a stream.               Atreyu is sleeping and we hear   Bastian: They had been traveling aimlessly for almost a week, but they could not find a cure for the Empress. Neither Atreyu or his horse, Artax, had the vaguest suspicion that the creature of darkness, the G'mork, was already tracking them down.   Artax crosses the small stream and wakes up Atreyu by nuzzling him.   Atreyu:  Wha ? What is it Artax. Is it time to go already    Oh, I know what you want. It's time to eat, huh? Good idea.   Bastian:  No, it's a great idea!   Bastian looks up from the book with a smile and grabbs his lunch from his back pack and begins to devour it.     VIEW of Bastian holding half the sandwich. He looks at it.   Bastian: No, not too much. We still have a long way to go.   VIEW of Atreyu and Artax traveling again.   G'mork arrives were they had been and catches their scent, and takes off following their trail.   CUT TO: Swamps of Sadness Bastian:         Atreyu and Artax had searched the Silver Mountains, the Desert of Shattered Hopes, and the Crystal Towers without success. And so, there was only one chance left. To find Morla, the ancient one, the wisest being in Fantasia whos home was the Shell Mountain somewhere in the deadly Swamps of Sadness.   Atreyu jumps off Artax and pulls him along through the swamp.   Bastian:  Everyone knew that whoever let the sadness overtake him would sink into the swamp.     Atreyu pulls his horse along saying reassuring things the whole time.   Atreyu:  That's it. Youre doing fine Artax.   Suddenly Artax stops and Atreyu pulls on the reigns. Artax doesn't budge   Atreyu: Come on Artax, what's the matter? What's wrong? Come on boy!   I understand, it's too difficult for you. (He tries pulling him in a different direction and steps into a puddle up to his waist. Suddenly he notices that Artax is sinking)   Atreyu: Artax you're sinking! Come on turn around, you have to! Now ! Come on! Artax !   He goes closer to him and hugs him. Atreyu:  Fight against the sadness Artax. Artax, please. You're letting the sadness of the swamps get to you. You have to try, you have to care. For me, I'm your friend, I love you.   (Artax doesn't move and Atreyu slaps the puddle sending water flying toward the horse. He yells at him again.)   Artax, you're sinking! Come on, turn around, you have to, now! Come on! Artax! Fight against the sadness, Artax. Artax, please, you're letting the sadness of the swamps get to you. You have to try. You have to care, for me, you're my friend, and I love you. Artax! Stupid horse! You've gotta move or you'll die! Move, please! I won't give up! Don't quit! Artax! Please!   (then he pleads with him.)   Move please. I won't give up! Jump quick! Artax please!   FADE OUT:     FADE IN:   SPLIT VIEW: of Atreyu sitting on a log crying as he looks at the spot where Artax had once been, and of Bastian looking up from the book. Both have tears streaming down their face, Bastian blows his nose on his handkerchief. Bastian turns the page.   VIEW: of Atreyu walking through the swamps crying. He stops suddenly and we see a mountain.                 style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">                 Atreyu: The Shell Mountain.   VIEW: of Bastian as he looks up from the book.               style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 2">                            Bastian:       Morla the ancient one. class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>  WIDE VIEW: Atreyu climbs up the muddy mountain and calls for Morla several times. The mountain      starts moving and he grabs a tree branch. The branch breaks and he slides down the mountain, hurting his shoulder. He lands in the swamp ground below and turns and crawls away to a tree nearby that faces the mountain. He climbs it and sees a giant turtle head coming out of the mountain. Bastian screams and Atreyu and Morla look around.   Bastian sits up SURPRISED. Bastian: But that's impossible, they couldn't have heard me.   Atreyu: Are you Morla, the ancient one?   Morla: Not that it matters but yes.   Atreyu: Please help me Morla. Do you recognize this?               Morla: Well, we haven't seen the Auryn in a long time.   Atreyu: We ? (he looks around) Is there someone else here too?   Morla: We haven't spoken to anyone else for thousands of years, so we started talking to ourselves.   (she sneezes and blows Atreyu out of the tree.)   Atreyu: Morla, I bring terrible news. Did you know that  the Empress is very ill?               Morla: Not that it matters, but yes. Actually we don't care.               Atreyu: If I don't save her, she'll die! There's a terrible nothing sweeping over the land. Don't you care about that? !               Morla: We don't even care whether on not we care.               Atreyu: Do you have a cold?   Morla: No, we're allergic to youth.   Atreyu: You know how I can help the Empress don't you?   Morla: Not that it matters, but yes.             Atreyu: If you don't tell me and the nothing keeps coming, you'll die to! Both of you!             Morla: Die ? That at least would be something.   She starts to sneeze again, but doesn't so Atreyu relaxes his grip on the tree. Unknowing that she can sneeze at any moment.               Atreyu: Please tell me. You said you knew the answer.             She sneezes and blows him out of the tree. She becomes agitated.               Morla: We're tired of sneezing, go away. Nothing matters.               Atreyu: (He climbs back up the tree)   That's not true. If it didn't really matter to you then you'd tell me.               Morla:         Hah hah, clever boy.   Atreyu:         Tell me please !               Morla: We don't know, but you can ask the Southern Oracle.   Atreyu:        How can I get there?               Morla: You can't . It's ten thousand miles away.               Atreyu:         But that's so far.               Morla:       That's right. Forget it. Good night.     CUT TO: School hallway   The school bell rings and Bastian sits up with a start. The school day Has ended and everyone is leaving. Bastian walks out as the lights turn off. The attic is spooky, it is dark and stormy. Bastian grabs his stuff and runs out of the attic, but then comes back, shaking his head.               Bastian:                  No. Atreyu wouldn't quit now.   He starts back towards the mat, but lightning followed by a loud clap of thunder Startles Bastian prompting him to leap backwards. A wolf head from an old school festival falls down in front of him and he screams in terror.   CUT TO: Swamps   View of Atreyu stumbling, exhausted through the swamp. He falls several times and has to stop for rest. His shoulder really hurts him. Atreyu stumbles into a puddle up to his neck and we see the wolf running after him. As Atreyu starts to faint he looks up and sees a dragon coming towards him from high in  the sky. The wolf reaches him right as the dragon picks him up. The wolf howls in anger as he misses the boy.   END SCENE:   FADE IN: Attic- Bastian   Bastian flops down on his back and sighs. Relieved that Atreyu escaped the Gmork and the swamps, but what was that creature that saved him? Bastian sits back up and starts reading again.               Bastian: After days and nights of unconsciousness, Atreyu slowly opened his eyes and found himself in strange surroundings. He was clean and his wounds were dressed.   VIEW: - Atreyu waking up. His is asleep behind the arm of the dog-like dragon. He lifts it's arm so he can get away. The dragon opens one eye, then closes it.               Atreyu: Shew.               Falkor: The dragon wakes up as Atreyu runs away. Leaving so soon, hmm?               Atreyu: Uh, I was just going..... I have to ...... I was trying to ... (he stutters.)               Falkor:             Sneak away?   Atreyu: Yea..... I mean no. No!               Falkor: I like children.               Atreyu: For breakfast?               Falkor: Never ! I'm a luck dragon. My name is Falkor.               Atreyu: And my name is..               Falkor: Atreyu. And you're on a quest.               Atreyu: How'd you know that?               Falkor: You were unconscious and you talked in your sleep.   Atreyu: Wha?               Falkor: (Falkor starts straining to reach his ear, but his leg is to short.) Could you get round and scratch behind my right ear?               Falkor: I can never quite reach it.               Atreyu: (Atreyu starts scratching a spot.) Here?               Falkor: Oh yea. Huh huh huh, oh. That's so good. Thank you.               Falkor: So little fella, you're on you're way to the Southern Oracle?               Atreyu: Yes, but it's hopeless. It's too far away!               Falkor: Oh, I wouldn't necessarily say that.               Atreyu: Do you know how to get there?               Falkor: Why sure, it's right around the corner.               Atreyu: How'd all this happen?!                 Falkor: With luck !               Atreyu: You've already brought me the entire Ten thousand miles?               Falkor: No, only nine thousand eight hundred and ninety one, as the dragon flies.               Atreyu: You're amazing!               Falkor:                       Having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a                      Quest. Things will work out fine Atreyu. Never give up hope and           style="mso-spacerun: yes">       Good luck will find you.               Atreyu: It's good to have a friend again.               Falkor: You have more than one. Look.   (motioning behind Atreyu.)     Atreyu goes to a small entrance and bends down to look in. A tiny old man sits writing in a book and an old lady comes in humming a tune. She throws some worms into a pot and stops to eat one. Atreyu closes his eyes disgusted. Atreyu smile as they start fighting.             Engywook: Get out of my light wench. You're disturbing my scientific work.               Urgl: You and your scientific work. What the boy needs now is one of my potions.               Engywook: The boy will need my scientific advice much more.               Urgl: Yes, yes, but not until he's well. Get back to your own place. I'm always finding you in my place!               Engywook: I'm going.   Atreyu clears his throat to get their attention               Engywook: He's well! Now it's my turn with him.                 Urgl: Oh no you don't! I decide when he's well. It's your turn when I say it's your turn.   VIEW -She gets a cup full of the mixture in the pot and comes to stand in front of him.   Urgl: Well, little man, still in pain ?   He puts a hand on his shoulder as he speaks to her. Testing the bandage.               Atreyu:          Um, a little, but it's all right.               Urgl: I like that. The patient telling the doctor it's all right. It has to hurt if it's to heal.   (She stops and sniffs the cup then holds it out to him.)   Here. Drink that.          (He takes it from her and starts drinking.)               Urgl: Good, huh? That's my batwing broth. There's eye of newt in there, tree mold, old lizard brains, scales from a rancid sea serpent.   Atreyu looks at the cup like he's sick. The old man stands and speaks to him.               Engywook: Just where did you and your dragon come from? What are you onto? Anything of interest to the scientific community?               Atreyu: My name's Atreyu. I came here to find the Southern Oracle.               Engywook: Oh, you've come to the right place my boy.               Urgl:            Here we go again.               Engywook: I am somewhat of an expert on the Southern Oracle.               Urgl:         It's my scientific specialty.        (she mocks Engywook)               Engywook:             It's my scientific specialty.                             Urgl: Why don't you sit down and be quiet for once ?!               Engywook: You keep quiet wench.               Urgl: Oh !               Engywook: It's now my turn.               Engywook:  My name is Engywook. Uh, she's Urgl. Ever heard of me?               Atreyu: I don't think so.               Engywook: You don't move in scientific circles.     Atreyu smiled apologetically and shook his head no.               Engywook: I am the expert on the Southern Oracle. Oh you've come to the right place my boy.               Urgl: There's no fool like an old fool.               Engywook: Wait. Stay here. To the observatory. he says stopping her. To the winch ,wench !   CUT TO: View of Urgl turning a handle of a large machine that pulls a Basket carrying Engywook to the top of a high ledge on one of the surrounding rocks. Atreyu follows him on the ground.               Engywook: Come on lazy bones, can't you go any faster ?   I've been studying the mystery of the Southern Oracle for years, someday I'll publish my book : A Century of Studying The Southern Oracle by Professor Engywook, volume one The Early Years.   Atreyu: Have you ever been to the Southern Oracle ?               Engywook: Well, what do you think? I work scientifically.   As Atreyu pulls himself up on the ledge he sees 2 great sphinx-like statues. The man looks into a improvised sort of telescope and then tells Atreyu to do the same.               Atreyu: Is that the Southern Oracle ?               Engywook: Well, no. It's the first of the 2 gates you must pass through before you reach the Southern Oracle and get me the final information for my book. Of course, most people never get that far.   Atreyu: Why?               Engywook: The sphinx's eyes stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth tries to pass by. Ah ! Here comes one that looks fancy.   VIEW of a man in fancy armor approaching the gate.               Engywook: Let's see what he really thinks of himself   (Atreyu watches through the telescope. The man starts to hesitate.)   Go on scaredy cat. Oh, go on!               Engywook: Oh, it's my turn, let me see.   (Atreyu ignores him.)   I'm the scientist.               Atreyu: He's going on. I think he's gonna make it.               Engywook:                         style="mso-tab-count: 1">            The sphinx's eyes, are they open are shut? Let me see !               Atreyu: They're shut.   (he looks back and forth between them.)   No wait ! The eyes are open !   Rays of pure light shoot out of the sphinx's eyes and zap the man. Atreyu looks up, shocked at the sight he had seen.             Engywook: Oh no! Did he make it ? Did he?             Atreyu: (Atreyu shakes his head.) No.             Engywook: Fancy armor doesn't help much. The sphinxes can see straight into your heart. Listen boy, next time let me see what happens ! It's my telescope.               Atreyu: (Atreyu sets his jaw determinedly.) I'm gonna try it.             Atreyu starts climbing down as Engywook calls after him               Engywook: No ! Don't go yet. I haven't told you about the next gate. It's even worse than this one. Atreyu ! Atreyu !   Atreyu continues on and approaches the gate. As he walks up the eyes stay closed.               Engywook: He'll never make it. He'll never make it.   Atreyu does fine until he sees the fallen man, who is just a charred skeleton. He panics and starts looking back and forth between the 2 sphinxes.               Engywook: (The old man cries out.) Don't start to doubt yourself now ,be confident !               Bastian: (Bastian cries out ) Be confident , be confident.   The eyes open and Bastian cries out.             Bastian: Run Atreyu run !               Engywook: Run Atreyu !   Atreyu looks straight ahead and Bastian calls out.               Bastian: Run now!   Atreyu runs through the gate and just barely makes it. He turns and looks back, then sighs.   Engywook is so happy he jumps in the basket and falls out when he gets back to where Falkor and Urgl are.             Engywook: He made it ,he made it !             View: Urgl is giving Falkor a shot.             Urgl: You could do with a dose of juicy vitamins too.               Engywook: He made it, Atreyu, he made it through the sphinx gate. I always said he could do it.             Urgl:  Oh good ! But that's no reason for you to go falling out of the Basket again?   Engywook: Oh hogwash!               Falkor: I knew he would be safe.               Engywook: Nonsense ! You don't understand anything! The worst one is coming up. Next is the Magic Mirror gate. Atreyu has to face his true self.               Falkor: So what ? That won't be too hard for him.               Engywook: Oh ! That's what everyone thinks. But kind people find that they are cruel, brave men discover that they are really cowards. Confronted with their true selves most men run away screaming ! VIEW: of Atreyu in a blizzard. He approaches the Mirror gate and looks into it.  After a while, he sees Bastian reading the story. Bastian looks up then throws the book across the room.             Bastian: No. This is going too far.   (He pauses and looks at the book.)   What if they really do know about me in Fantasia?   (He picks the book back up.)     VIEW: of Atreyu. He sticks his hand through the Mirror and then pulls it back out. Then he walks through the gate.             Bastian: (Bastian lights a candle) The Southern Oracle?   Atreyu approaches another two sphinxes. As he approaches they start speaking to him.               Oracle:                  Do not be afraid. We will not harm you.                     We have been waiting for you a long time Atreyu.   (they speak in unison.)               Atreyu: Are you the Southern Oracle?                 Oracle: Yes, we are.               Atreyu: Then you must know what can save Fantasia !               Oracle: Yes we do.               Atreyu: Well, what is it ? I have to know.               Oracle: The Empress needs.... a new name.               Atreyu: A new name. Is that all ? But that's easy ! I can give her any name she wants.               Oracle: No one from Fantasia can do it, only a human child.               Atreyu: A human child ? Where can I find one?               Oracle: They can only be reached beyond the boundaries of Fantasia. You must hurry Atreyu. We do not know how much longer we can withstand the nothing.   (The sphinxes start crumbling. Atreyu runs away calling for Falkor.)   VIEW - Falkor with Atreyu on his back. They are flying over Fantasia.               Atreyu: Hurry Falkor, the nothing's everywhere.               Falkor: Don't worry. We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.               Atreyu: Do you know where they are ?               Falkor: I have no idea.               Atreyu: Then how are we supposed to find them?               Falkor: With luck.               Atreyu: Faster Falkor, faster.                 style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 2">                            Falkor: All right ! Hang on tight! VIEW- Falkor carrying Atreyu over many different lands of Fantasia. A beautiful display of landscapes play over the screen then we   CUT TO- Attic window  CLOSE UP of Bastian.                 Bastian: What a shame they don't ask me. My mother, she had such a wonderful name.   He closes the window and goes back to reading the book.   On and on they flew until they reached the Sea of Possibilities where they could go no further.   VIEW of Falkor and Atreyu. The sky is gray and is incredibly windy. Great storm clouds can be seen all around churning and expanding. It is the Nothing, the force destroying fantasia, and Falkor and Atreyu Have ended up right in the center of part of it.               Falkor: Look Atreyu, the nothing.   Falkor is tossed around in all directions, Atreyu tries to hold on as best as he can. The wind blows wilder and wilder until finally it tosses Falkor onto his back, and knocks his passenger into the air. Atreyu falls, but Falkor cannot get to him before he disappears into the chaos below.   CUT TO- Attic   The window bursts open and Bastian climbs up and closes it. Against a torrent of rain and wind. Finally he gets the window closed and he looks down at the book, he is soaked, and a bit winded at his experience. Then he remembers the story hero.               style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">             Bastian:            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">             Atreyu ! FADE TO- View of Atreyu on a lying on a beach. Atreyu wakes with a start, and discovers that the Auryn is gone. He stands up and looks at  the sky, searching frantically for his friend Falkor, but Falkor is not there.               Atreyu: Falkor !Falkor !Where are you? Falkor !   Somewhere in the heavens Falkor is searching for Atreyu.               Falkor: View of Falkor calling for Atreyu." Atreyu ! Atreyu !             Atreyu: Falkor !   Atreyu reluctantly gives up on calling Falkor. He turns his eyes to the beach, he finds a trail of foot prints in the sand, but they were not his, but that of a large beast. Atreyu follows them and Finds himself following a path to a city that has seen better days.On his way he stopps to rest leaning against the remains of what seems like a stone wall, but he soon finds that it was not a wall at all, but a Rockbiter. The giant looks down at atreyu and holds  out his hands.               Rockbiter: They look like big, good, strong hands. Don't they?          (Atreyu looks down saddened.)                      I always thought that's what they were. My little friends.       The little man with his racing snail, the Nighthob, even     the stupid bat. I couldn't hold on to them. The nothing pulled them right out of my hands. I failed.   Atreyu looks down, feeling terrible.             Atreyu: No you didn't fail. I'm the one who was chosen to stop the nothing. But I lost the Auryn, I can't find my luck dragon, so I won't be able to get past the boundaries of Fantasia.               Rockbiter: Listen, the nothing will be here any minute. I will just sit here and let it take me away too. They look like big, good, strong hands. Don't they?   Rockbiter starts crying as Atreyu shakes his head yes and fights his own tears. He continues along the trail again, and finds himself in a different part of the city. Ahead of him is a larce mostly intact building, Atreyu dodges falling rocks and enters an opening.   On the walls are paintings of everything that's happened during his Quest. The Empress giving the Auryn to Carion, Carion giving the Auryn to Atreyu,  Atreyu trying to save Artax in the Swamps of Sadness, Morla, and Falkor, and more.   As Atreyu turns a corner he sees a painting of a wolf, then he turns another  corner and sees the wolf hiding in a smaller opening. It growls wildly at Atreyu as he approaches               Gmork: If you come any closer I will rip you to shreds.   Atreyu squats down where he's at and looks at the wolf.               Atreyu: Who are you?               Gmork: I am G'mork. And you, whoever you are, can have the honor of being my last victim.               Atreyu: I will not die easily. I am a warrior.               Gmork: (G'mork laughs.) Brave warrior, then fight the nothing.               Atreyu: But I can't ! I can't get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.   G'mork laughs and Atreyu grows angry.             Atreyu: What's so funny about that ?               Gmork: Fantasia has no boundaries.   A storm grows closer to the city, slowly shaking it to pieces  Rocks fall here and there.             Atreyu: That's not true. You're lying.               Gmork: Foolish boy. Don't you know anything about Fantasia? It's the world of human fantasy. Every part ,every creature of it, is a piece of the dreams and hopes of mankind. Therefor, it has no boundaries.   There's a crash and more rocks fall.             Atreyu: But why is Fantasia dying then ?               Gmork: Because people have begun to loose their hopes and forget their dreams. So the nothing grows stronger.               Atreyu: What is the nothing ?!               Gmork: It's the emptiness that's left. It's like a despair, destroying this world. And I have been trying to help it.                 Atreyu: But why ?               Gmork: Because people who have no hopes are easy to control. And whoever has control has the power.   A large crash shakes the ground. Atreyu loses his balance for a moment, but quickly regains it and turns back to the wolf. He gives him a cold look then asks him,             Atreyu: Who are you really ?               Gmork: I am the servant of the power behind the nothing. I was sent to kill the only one who could have stopped the nothing. I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness. His name was Atreyu.   The ground shakes and Atreyu falls over backward. He grabs a long, sharp piece of broken stone and stands up. He then yells at G'mork.               Atreyu: If we're about to die anyway, I'd rather die fighting. Come for me G'mork ! I am Atreyu!   G'mork growls and jumps at him. Atreyu plunges the sharp rock into the beasts heart, killing the Gmork. As Atreyu pulls himself from the carcass of the Gmork,  Atreyu finds that the beast managed to inflict a wound on Atreyu. He stands and  winces at the deep gash across his chest. Another crash echoes through the ruins as Atreyu makes his way out of the ruins.   CUT TO- Ocean Falkor under water   Falkor dived deep into the Sea following a slight ray of light from beneath the waves. As he swims deeper and deeper more and more bubbles form around his body, finally he reaches a coral reef, and finds that the ray of light was coming from the lost necklace. Falkor opens his mouth, and plucks the Auryn  from the coral with his teeth.   Driven by a will much like his own he headed straight for the abandoned city. Below him he could barely make out the form of Atryeu leaving a collapsing building.   Atreyu comes out of an opening and latches onto a tree as the Nothing consumes more and more the surrounding land. Atreyu calls out for Falkor and this time Falkor calls back.                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Falkor:      Atreyu, hang on!   Atreyu holds tight to the tree as strong winds threaten to rip him from the branches. Almost as he was losing his grip Falkor plucked him out of the tree, and headed for  safer skies. But that was all there was left, below them the Nothing enveloped the remaining pieces of land. Fantasia was gone.                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Bastian:                         style="mso-spacerun: yes">       That was the end of Fantasia. Only a few fragments remained     of this once rich and beautiful world had been left by the nothing.   VIEW  Falkor flies through a belt of fragments still remaining after the Nothing. The sky is  graveyard of left over pieces of Fantasia. Atreyu wakes from his exhaustion and looks around with a heavy heart.               Atreyu: Good old Falkor, can you see anything ? Anything at all ?               Falkor: No, all the land is gone.               Atreyu: I know, and all because I failed.               Falkor: You tried.               Atreyu: Do you suppose the Ivory Tower is still standing?               Falkor: Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.   Atreyu looks down at the amulet dangling from his neck, and gets an idea  that might just help them.               Atreyu: Let the Auryn guide you.   (He clutches the medallion with his hands )   If the Ivory Tower still stands take us there. CLOSE UP-   VIEW- The Auryn starts glowing and the fragments move, behind them standing  in all its glory is the ivory tower.               Atreyu: Falkor ! The Ivory Tower !   They approach the tower. And it appears to have been spared by the Nothing. We span over all its beautiful features before we come to rest at the court before the Empresss chamber.   VIEW-  Bastian. He leans forward and whispers                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 2">                            Bastian: The Empress       VIEW- Atreyu walks up the stairs that lead to the Empress's room. The chamber door begins to open. He pauses and looks back at Falkor.               Falkor: Go on.   He enters the room and the door closes behind him. Before him was the Childlike Empress in person. She sits silently on her bed, her gaze never leaves Atreyu.               Childlike Empress:                         style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-spacerun: yes">        Atreyu, why do you look so sad?   He takes off the Auryn and hands it to her. She looks at it, and then him for an explanation.               Atreyu:                         style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-spacerun: yes">            I have failed you Empress.               Childlike Empress:                                                   No, you haven't.

The one who can save us all.               Atreyu:                You knew about the Earthling child ?!               Childlike Empress:                         Of course. I knew everything.               Atreyu: (Atreyu grows angry with her)   My horse died, I nearly drowned, and I just  barely got away from the nothing. For what ?! To find out what you already knew ?!               Childlike Empress:                                            It was the only way to get in touch with an Earthling.               Atreyu:                                                   But I didn't get in touch with an Earthling !                    Childlike Empress:                                                                            Yes, you did.   Bastian sits up slowly as we hear what she's saying.               Childlike Empress:                                     He has suffered with you. He went through everything you went                                      through. And now, he has come here with you. He's very close.                                                        Listening to every word that we say.             Atreyu looks around, as does she.                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Bastian:                         style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            What ?!   Two fragments of Fantasia collide and explode shaking the Tower Violently.                         style="mso-spacerun: yes"> Atreyu:  Where is he ?

Atreyu turns around to see where it cracked, then he turns back to the Empress.               Atreyu: What will happen if he doesn't appear?!               Childlike Empress:                         style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Then our world will disappear, and so will I.               Atreyu:           How can he let that happen ?!               Childlike Empress:                                             He doesn't understand that he's the one who has the                                             power to stop it.

Bastian waves to them and Rockbiter waves back. They change their direction and suddenly below them is a great endless field, the Great Plains.

          Scene 1. TITLE SEQUENCE

          
          Darkness. Then, a burst of sparks from a bowl held in a scaly hand.
          The light shows us a mural. We start to move along the wall. First we
          see stars and planets, painted in a primitive, stylized fashion on
          bare rock. A voice on the track speaks softly to us.

          
          VOICE: We did not always live in hiding.

          
          We have come to the image of a huge family tree, which springs from
          a single seed but divides into two separate halves. On the left,
          ruled by the moon, the branches blossom into extraordinary creatures.
          On the right, by sunlight, the branches end in ordinary human beings.

          
          Upon the word Nightbreed the title comes up on the screen, against
          the image of a moon painted on the wall.

          2L. EXT. REEDS NIGHT


          
          Cut to a real moon. Then cut wide to a moonlit landscape, through
          which the camera careens madly. The soundtrack, which was lush and
          almost sacred in the mural chamber, erupts into a tribal rhythm. We
          glimpse creatures in the darkness, moving through the reeds. They are
          barely more than silhouettes. We see teeth, and gleaming eyes;
          glimpses of naked, patterned flesh. Only glimpses.

          

          2M. INT. MURAL CHAMBER


          
          Cut back to the mural chamber. Now we have moved away from the tree
          to a more brutal scene. A symbolic representation of a great
          apocalyptic war between Naturals and Breed. Terrible scenes of
          destruction.

          
          VOICE: But the Naturals made war on us. They feared us for our
          strength. They envied our powers. They called us monsters, killing us
          by whatever means their malice could invent, finding in each of us
          our particular vulnerability. 

          
          We are scanning scenes of that war. A breed being staked like a
          vampire. Another being shot like a werewolf. Another exposed to
          sunlight.

          
          VOICE: None of us was safe. The tribes of the moon dwindled. Our
          gods were slaughtered, our homes destroyed. It was the Apocalypse.

          

          2N. EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES


          
          Cut back to the landscape. The clouds roil above the heads of the
          creatures heading through the reeds. We see their destination now. A
          huge wall, with gates.

          

          2P. INT. MURAL CHAMBER


          
          And back to the mural chamber, and a final scene. The gates we've
          just seen are in the painting. Looking over them, calling the Breed
          in, is a vast indistinct form: that of Baphomet. His eyes burn; his
          arms are open in welcome.

          
          VOICE: Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust. Baphomet.
          Wounded and near death, he summoned us, the last of the last, into
          hiding. Into Midian, where we wait now. The battle is over but not
          the war. There will come a saviour.

          
          Now we've moved beyond the image of the gate into a new patch of
          wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches. We can interpret
          some of the images nevertheless: a man with a bloody hole in the
          middle of his chest. A man wearing a mask like a skull. We linger on
          a faceless figure.

          
          VOICE: His name is Cabal. He will lead and give us back the Night.
          We are the tribes of the moon. We are the Nightbreed.

          
          The titles end.

          

          2Q. EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES


          
          Cut back to the landscape. Now we are at the gates, and the
          creatures slip through and away into the mist. Only one, a beautiful,
          ferocious female called Shuna Sassi remains, turning to look at us.
          She beckons.

          
          SHUNA: Come...

          
          The camera retreats from her.

          
          SHUNA: Will you not come?

          
          Now the last of the creatures, the Drummer, takes her by the arm,
          snatching her away through the gates. As she disappears, the camera
          follows again, stopping at the gates themselves, which close with an
          unearthly din.

          2R. INT. LORI'S APARTMENT NIGHT


          
          C.U. on Boone, closed eyes. He is dreaming. His gaze roves beneath
          his lids.

          
          Lori's lips come into shot kissing first his eyes and then traveling
          down his face to his mouth.

          
          LORI: Boone...wake up.

          
          Boone's eyes flicker open.

          
          LORI: Hi. You OK?

          
          Boone: Yep.

          
          Now Boone's eyes are fully open. He sits up. Looks towards the open
          window. Night beyond. She kisses him, distracting him from the sight
          of the window.

          
          LORI: You want something to eat?

          
          BOONE: Sure. What time is it?

          
          LORI: Nine-thirty. I was letting you doze.

          
          BOONE: Thought you'd worn me out, huh?

          
          Lori smiles, and kisses him, then crosses the room to the kitchen
          area, picks up some fruit, and a knife, carrying both back to where
          Boone is lying on the bed. It is unmade. Both Lori and Boone are
          lightly dressed, clothes casually thrown on after an afternoon
          lovemaking.

          
          Lori: You know what?

          
          BOONE: What?

          
          LORI: We should get out of Calgary for a few days. Just take off.

          
          BOONE: Anywhere special?

          
          LORI: Somewhere we can be alone together.

          
          BOONE: More alone than this?

          
          LORI: Yeah. Just you and me. No work. No telephone calls. No...

          
          BOONE: Bad dreams.

          
          LORI: No bad dreams.

          
          BOONE: How did you know?

          
          LORI: I know. I always know. It's no big deal.

          
          BOONE: I'm going around in some crazy loop in my head.

          
          LORI: You're not crazy.

          
          BOONE: No.

          
          LORI: Say it like you mean it.

          
          BOONE: I believe it. I'm not crazy. But I want this damn dream out
          of my head. 

          
          He gets up and goes to the window.

          
          BOONE: Decker's started calling me again.

          
          LORI: When?

          
          BOONE: All last week. Every day.

          
          LORI: What does he want?

          
          BOONE: I don't know. I haven't called him back.

          
          LORI: If he can help, see him. Tell him it's all gone but the bad
          dreams.

          
          BOONE: They're not bad. That's what's weird. The more I have them
          the more I like them. Now I do sound like a crazy, right?

          
          LORI: No. You sound like the man I love. A little haunted, maybe,
          but the sanest man I ever met.

          
          BOONE: Keep going.

          
          LORI: Will you see Decker?

          
          BOONE: You think I should?

          
          LORI: Where's the harm? You tell him from me, I'm the only thing you
          should be dreaming about.

          
          BOONE: I don't think he'd get it. He never had a wet dream in his
          life.

          
          LORI: I don't want to be competing with things I can't see, Boone.
          Can't share I don't want to be always feeling that something's
          pulling at you.

          
          BOONE: I'm not going anywhere, Lori. Except with you.

          
          LORI: I can't hear that often enough.

          
          BOONE: I'll never leave you. Not ever. I swear.

          
          He kisses her, passionately.

          
          BOONE: Can't remember a time when I didn't love you.

          
          LORI: How about before we met?

          
          BOONE: Even then.

          
          They kiss again. We move past them into the darkness outside the
          window.

          
          Dissolve to the moon, clearing cloud.

          16. EXT. RICKMAN HOUSE NIGHT


          
          A pleasant house in a pleasant neighborhood. Lights burn inside.

          

          17. INT. RICKMAN HOUSE NIGHT


          
          Melissa Rickman emerges from the lounge, with a Dagwood sandwich, a
          work in progress. She is thirty-five, and going to seed in a gentle
          way. Her husband, Lou Rickman, a similar type, is planted in front of
          the television.

          
          MELISSA: Okay, you want ham, cheese, pickle, mustard?

          
          LOU: All of the above and a brewski, thank you.

          
          MELISSA: You're getting porky, Lou.

          
          LOU [amiable - tried to grab her]: I'm comfortable. I like myself
          fat. I like you fat too...

          
          MELISSA [secretly amused - she hushes him]: Keep it down, Lou,
          you'll wake the munchkins.

          
          She hears something upstairs, goes to the foot of the stairs, looks
          up. Her eldest son, Lou Two, waddles into view. He's five.

          
          LOU TWO: Mommy...

          
          MELISSA: Sweetie, you're supposed to be beddy-bye.

          
          LOU TWO: I heard something.

          
          MELISSA: What did you hear?

          
          LOU TWO: Bad man.

          
          MELISSA: No, everything's okay. You go back to bed, munchkin, I'll
          be up to see you in a minute.

          
          LOU [V.O.]: How's that sandwich coming?

          
          MELISSA: Coming...

          
          Melissa disappears from the bottom of the stairs.

          

          18. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT


          
          Melissa enters, moves out of sight. We stay at the door. A figure
          appears dressed in black, knives in both hands, and crosses to leave
          the screen again. We do not see his face. But we hear his labours:
          the sound of the blades slicing Melissa. She staggers into view,
          grabbing hold of her slit throat. Blood bubbles between her fingers.
          The figure appears behind her. She turns, as the knife descends.

          

          19. INT. RICKMAN LOUNGE NIGHT


          
          Lou hears a sound, rises and moves towards the kitchen door.

          
          LOU: Melissa?

          
          At the top of the stairs, Lou Two watches wide-eyed.

          

          20. INT. RICKMAN STAIRS NIGHT


          
          Lou Two's P.O.V. - We see blood running along the highway.

          

          21. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT


          
          Lou reaches the kitchen door and sees Melissa laid out, dead, on the
          kitchen table

          
          LOU: Oh God - GOD!

          
          Lou enters, the figure emerges from behind him. While we remain at
          the door watching, detached, Lou fights back, throwing himself back
          and forth around the kitchen. But the figure is much stronger. We
          glimpse its face now, it is a mask, with a zipper for a mouth and
          buttons for eyes, blank. Devoid of compassion, hatred or regret. A
          death's head, made by a mad child.

          
          Atop the stairs, Lou Two listens. His baby sister cries in her cot.
          He looks her way then back downstairs. The sounds cease. Silence.
          Terror on his face. Then the child's perfect nightmare appears at the
          bottom of the stairs. The figure, heavy knife in hand, starts to
          climb, dragging Lou's bloody body after him by the hair.

          BOONE [on tape]: Hi. Please leave a message.

          Three patrol cars, an ambulance, policeman restraining a small crowd
          gathered outside. A n.d. sedan roars up, red bubble light flashing,
          and Inspector Joyce gets out and moves towards the house. He's
          greeted by the Medical Examiner, Dr Burton, just exiting, carrying a
          medical bag.

          
          BURTON [bitter]: Brace yourself, Inspector.

          
          JOYCE: Same profile?

          
          BURTON: Unmistakable. Doesn't miss a trick.

          
          JOYCE [anguished]: Kids? Two kids?

          
          BURTON: If it's any comfort, they went quickly.

          
          JOYCE: Yeah. Makes me feel a whole lot better about the sick fuck.

          
          BURTON: Find this guy, Joyce. They say these guys want to be caught.
          I think this one likes it too much.

          
          A rookie patrolman stands on the doorstep, on the verge of tears.

          
          JOYCE [gently]: Let's get these tourists back, Officer.

          
          POLICEMAN: Yes sir.

          
          JOYCE [to Burton]: If we can't protect the kids, what the hell use

          29. INT. DR DECKER'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Close on a pile of tapes, marked with dates over a period of two
          years. They're on Decker's desk.

          
          DECKER: I've been listening to the tapes of our sessions. All two
          years' worth...

          
          We move from the tapes to Decker, who gets up from his desk and
          moves around to the other side. Boone is sitting on the other side of
          the desk, his posture far from relaxed. He hates this room. As Decker
          moves, we take in the various pictures on the walls. Dance pictures,
          photographs of Decker with civic dignitaries, crippled children etc.

          
          BOONE: Why?

          
          DECKER: Most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case
          like yours. The most they would have done was drug you. But you...you
          intrigued me. All the talk of monsters. And Midian. Remember Midian?

          
          BOONE: That wasn't me. I heard about Midian from other people.

          
          DECKER: But you made it part of your private mythology.

          
          BOONE: I suppose I did. It was a place of refuge.

          
          DECKER: When you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented
          city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be forgiven?

          
          Boone's looking uneasy now. He wipes sweat from his upper lip.

          
          BOONE: You know what I used to dream.

          
          DECKER: Yes. There's a remarkable consistency in the images you see.
          Great detail. Almost as though the violence was real.

          
          BOONE: They were just bad dreams. Midian doesn't exist. Monsters
          don't exist. 

          
          DECKER: But murder does, Boone. Murder's very real. It may start in
          the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and blood.

          
          He picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene, and takes the
          photographs out.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: Two days ago the police brought me some
          photographs. They wanted to know if I had any patients who might be
          capable of what's in these photographs. I'm going to show you them.
          Are you ready for that?

          
          Boone nods.

          
          Decker lays the photographs on the table. Boone picks them up. We
          get glimpses of what they contain. Domestic horrors. Bloody scenes of
          corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions, sliced up and
          bleeding. Boone's breath quickens.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: When you talk about murder on the tapes, I thought
          it was invention. Now I'm not so sure.

          
          Boone keeps staring at the pictures. The glassy eyes stare hard at
          him. His breathing is now rapid and shallow. One or two of the images
          seem to move. Bodies twitch. He drops the photographs.

          
          BOONE: I didn't...

          
          DECKER: Didn't what?

          
          BOONE: They were bad dreams.

          
          DECKER: What you describe in your sessions is very specific. Houses;
          faces...

          
          BOONE: I don't remember.

          
          DECKER: You want to hear?

          
          BOONE: No!

          
          Decker picks up the photographs. Boone, highly agitated, gets up and
          paces the room.

          
          BOONE[cont.]: You think I did this?

          
          DECKER: Six families killed over a two year period. All within
          driving distance of Calgary...

          
          BOONE [fury]: Do you think I did this?

          
          DECKER: I hope to God you didn't, for both our sakes. We've come a
          long way together. I don't want to believe this any more than you do.

          
          BOONE: But you do.

          
          DECKER: I wouldn't put us through this pain if I didn't...if I
          wasn't...afraid you had.

          
          BOONE [desperate; helpless]: What do I do? God, tell me what to do.

          
          DECKER: I can only go so far on your behalf. Patient
          confidentiality's one thing. Protecting a killer is another.

          
          BOONE [breaking down]: Jesus...Jesus...Jesus...

          
          Decker returns to his desk. Puts the photographs down and picks up a
          vial of prescription pills. He crosses to boone.

          
          DECKER: Listen to me. Take these, they'll help. Go home, and
          consider what we've talked about. I'm going to give you twenty-four
          hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own
          accord. That's as long as I can give you. if you haven't complied by
          then, I'm afraid I'll have to tell them what I know.

          
          Boone grabs the pills.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: I can't tell you how sorry I am...

          and starts to make a pile with them. He pours lighter fuel on the
          pictures, and watches them burn. Sitting against the wall still
          sweating he takes some more pills.

          
          We see Lori's love letters burn and hear her voice speaking the
          words as they are consumed.

          
          Boone cries. Then he hears Lori's voice say:

          
          LORI: Boone...

          
          Lori is sitting on the edge of the bed. Boone looks round, sees
          himself against the wall and moves forward past the real Boone towards
          the bed...

          
          Boone watches as he and Lori make love on the bed. We close in on
          the love-making. Lori leans to kiss him.

          
          BOONE: I'll never leave you...

          
          Cut back to boone, his face all grief.

          
          BOONE: Stupid. 

          

          CUT TO:

          

          40B. INT. BOONE'S BATHROOM AFTERNOON


          
          Boone's hand pulls the shower curtain aside and turns on the water.
          The water pours on him.

          

          41. HALLUCINATION

          
          Another of the murder scenes comes to life. Corpses pulse with
          hideous animation.

          

          42. INT. BOONE'S BATHROOM AFTERNOON


          
          With a cry Boone slides to the shower floor, panting, haunted,
          destroyed.

          
          BOONE [faintly]: ...I did it...I did it all...

          

          43. INT. BOONE'S APARTMENT EVENING


          
          Behind him, the last of the fire flickers. He looks through the
          blinds at the sunset. Takes another pill. Puts on his leather jacket.
          Exits. The door slams.

          

          44. SCENE DELETED

          

          45. INT. NIGHTCLUB NIGHT


          
          Lori is on stage, sexy, vivacious, fronting a tight C & W band in a
          hip rendition of 'Johnny Be Angry'.

          

          46. INT. NIGHTCLUB NIGHT


          
          Lori's P.O.V. looking though the crowd in front of the stage. Lori
          spots Boone standing near the entrance, his face in shadow.

          
          Her eyes light up with joy as the song builds to climax. It ends.
          Applause, cat whistles, foot stomping. Lori's in heaven. She looks
          out again. 

          
          Boone is gone.

          

          47. EXT. HIGHWAY NIGHT


          
          Boone steps into view by the side of the road, watches the traffic.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          48. INT. NIGHTCLUB CORRIDOR NIGHT


          
          Confused and worried, Lori stands in the empty corridor, a note
          Boone has left for her in her hand.

          
          Boone edges out closer to the road. Spots a huge semi with a fully
          loaded trailer barrelling down towards him.

          
          Lori opens the note and reads: 'Keep this. Burn the rest. All
          wrong.' Tears burst from Lori's eyes.

          
          Boone flings himself in front of the oncoming truck.

          

          CUT TO BLACK:

          

          FADE IN:

          

          49. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT


          
          A blaze of light. A bustling emergency receiving area. A stern nurse
          goes through the pockets of Boone's jackets, which is lying beside
          him on a gurney. His eyes are closed, face and T-shirt bloody. She
          fishes out the vial of pills.

          
          Boone moans, opens his eyes.

          
          NURSE Lucky you're in one piece, fella.

          
          BOONE [realizing where he is]: ...can't even kill myself...

          
          NURSE: There's a cheerful thought. [to an approaching doctor] I
          don't know what kind of fuel he's using, but this guy's cruising at
          about 35,000 feet.

          
          The doctor takes the vial of pills, checks the label. Opens Boone's
          eyes, shines a penlight flash on the pupils. Boone recoils. Doctor
          takes his pulse.

          
          DOCTOR: You don't hit that altitude on lithium carbonate. Let's get
          the prescribing doctor on the line... [finally - to Boone] Okay,
          we're doing all right, aren't we? Tell me, what've you been taking
          tonight, partner?

          
          BOONE: Lithium...

          
          The doctor opens the vial, looks at a handful of the pills.

          
          DOCTOR: Lithium? This isn't lithium, my friend. [to the nurse] Let's
          move him. Observation, let's get an IV, valium/saline, 200 milligrams
          percodan for pain, as needed...[quietly - hands the pills to the
          nurse] We'll have to call this in.

          
          She nods. With considerable effort, Boone sits up urgently and grabs
          the doctor's hand, holding the pills.

          
          BOONE: What was I taking?

          
          DOCTOR [patronizing]: Easy. We don't know until we run some tests.
          Looks like some kind of lab quality psychotropic hallucinogen. You're
          on what we used to call a 'bad trip' there, buddy. You relax now,
          you're gonna be fine.

          
          The doctor and nurse ease Boone back down onto the gurney. The
          doctor moves away. The nurse pulls back the curtain and rolls Boone
          across the hall into a semi-private room

          

          50. INT. SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT


          
          From emergency behind them, a warning buzzer sounds.

          
          VOICE [thru loudspeaker]: Code blue! Code blue!

          
          In an emergency room cubicle, a patient is having a seizure. The
          nurse rushes off, leaving Boone. Interns roll the cardiac cart
          towards the cubicle and curtains close around the scene.

          
          The door to Boone's room swings closed, shutting out the sounds.
          Boone exhales heavily. Closes his eyes.

          
          NARCISSE [V.O.] [muttering - half mumbled ranting]: Shit! Shit! Take
          me, why don't you take me?

          
          Boone opens his eyes. Looks across the room at Narcisse, a wild man,
          half-derelict, half-punk, bloodied, his hand bandaged, pacing back
          and forth like a caged cat, staring out of a large picture window at
          the night.

          

          51. EXT. HOSPITAL WINDOW NIGHT


          
          Looking in at the brightly lit window framed in the dark building,
          as Narcisse restlessly moves across it, peering outside.

          

          52. INT. SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT


          
          NARCISSE [low and anxious]: They've gone, they've gone, they were
          here, they were coming for me, where'd they go? Shit!

          
          BOONE: Hey...

          
          NARCISSE [turns on him - viciously]: Shut up, shut up! They saw you,
          they won't come while you're here, they won't show themselves to the
          likes of you, don't you see that?

          
          BOONE [placating - knows the type]: Sure, okay.

          
          NARCISSE: Shit! I've missed them, I've missed them! You scared them
          off, you kept them from me!

          
          Narcisse paces again, starting to sob and sniffle. Boone leans back.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.] [barely audible - between cries]:
          ...Midian...Midian...

          
          Boone's eyes open like a shot.

          
          BOONE: What did you say?

          
          NARCISSE: I said shut up, you want to ruin everything?

          
          Boone leaps to his feet, grabs and easily overpowers the smaller man.

          
          BOONE: What did you say, just now?

          
          NARCISSE [suddenly friendly]: What did you say, just now?

          
          BOONE: You said Midian.

          
          NARICSSE [coyly]: Did I? Maybe...

          
          BOONE [hurting him - desperate]: What do you know about it?

          
          NARCISSE: It's where the monsters go. It takes away the pain...

          
          Narcisse reaches his hands into his pockets, then comes out with
          long, silver, razor-sharp artificial nails, curved like hooks,
          attached to his thumbs. He holds them right at Boone's throat, ready
          to cut. He smiles.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: ...what do you know about it?

          
          BOONE [pause; cautiously]: They forgive you there.

          
          NARCISSE: Uh-huh. Ever kill anybody?

          
          BOONE: Yes.

          
          NARCISSE: See, they only take you if you're worthy. You know what
          they do to those that aren't worthy?

          
          Boone shakes his head. Narcisse draws one razor-nail lightly across
          his own throat. A thin trickle of blood runs down his neck. He
          chuckles.

          
          BOONE: It's real. Midian's real. [Narcisse nods; carefully] And you
          know...where it is. Don't you? We could go there...

          
          NARCISSE: They sent you. They sent you to take me.

          
          BOONE: That's right. But first I need to know...you have to tell
          me...where it is.

          
          NARCISSE: It's a test? [Boone nods; Narcisse leans in to him -
          whispers] No maps.

          
          BOONE: But you do know. Don't you?

          
          NARCISSE [looks around; leans in again]: North of Athabasca. East of
          Peace River. Near Shere Neck, north of Dwyer.

          
          Satisfied, Boone releases him, go back to the bed, collects his
          jacket.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.] [ exhilarated]: You'll take me with you, I'm
          worthy, you ask anyone, I knew you'd come, they sent you to take me,
          I was waiting. I know, I know, first I have to show you, that's how
          it works.

          
          Boone is looking out of the window in the door, sizing up his escape.

          
          BOONE: Show me what?

          
          NARCISSE: My true face. That's what there are for. [he raises his
          bladed thumbs] So you can see. I'm not a natural man. Underneath I'm
          a monster, that's how it works; I show you, then you take me with
          you...

          
          He puts the blade to either side of his face. We hear the skin pop.

          

          BOONE: NO!

          
          Blood pours from Narcisse's face, as he traces the outline of his
          face.

          

          53. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker, who's just arrived with Lieutenant Joyce and two
          policemen, is speaking with the doctor that examined Boone.

          
          DECKER [urgent - showing Boone's file]: ...he was an abandoned
          child, raised by the state, first diagnosis of incipient
          schizophrenia at thirteen, juvenile delinquency, periodically
          institutionalized through early adulthood...some violent episodes,
          never criminally charged as an adult, he's been in my care for less
          than a year...

          
          A bloodcurdling scream from the semi-private room rivets the
          attention of the emergency room

          

          54. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT


          
          Following the nurse and an intern as they burst into the room and
          are greeted with the sight of Narcisse, blood running freely,
          ripping the least of his scalp off his bare skull, laughing and
          crying maniacally.

          
          Boone stands near the door, horrified.

          
          NARCISSE [variously]: TAKE ME! TAKE ME! I'M A MONSTER!

          
          Nurse [over - to Boone] What the hell have you done?

          
          Boone: Nothing!

          
          INTERN: Fucking junkies! [at the door - yelling into the corridor]
          Doctor!

          
          As the door swings open, Boone looks out into the corridor and at
          the far end of the emergency room he sees Decker and the cops looking
          his way. Medical support move towards the room, as the nurse and
          intern try to contain the ranting Narcisse.

          
          Boone grabs a loose doctor's coat off the back of the door, slips it
          on and backs out of the room.

          
          BOONE: Let's get some help in here!

          
          Pandemonium. Narcisse screams, as a half-dozen people struggle to
          subdue him. As help continues to rush into the room, Boone slowly
          backs away, out and around a corner. He stops beside a swinging door,
          sensing something.

          

          55. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker moving through emergency towards the mêlée, stops on the
          other side of the swinging door, his senses lit up with alarm. He
          slowly turns to the door. Pushes it open. Empty.

          

          56. EXT. HOSPITAL NIGHT


          
          Boone moves rapidly away from the exit into the parking lot, tossing
          off the white coat, breaking into a run. He tries several car doors,
          finds one open, gets in.

          

          57. INT. CAR NIGHT


          
          With a rush of adrenal intensity, Boone expertly rips open an under
          panel of the dash, locates and patches together the correct ignition
          wires and hot-starts the car. Closes the door. Puts it in gear.

          

          58. EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT


          

          INT. CAR NIGHT


          
          Boone slowly drives out of the lot trying not to attract the
          attention of the fleet of patrol cars sirens wailing, pouring into
          the area.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          59. EXT. FREEWAY NIGHT


          
          Boone drives up an entrance ramp and onto the highway, past a sign
          that reads:

          

          'HIGHWAY 2/NORTH'

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          60. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker, a few policeman and medical personnel wait outside the
          door leading to the semi-private room. Lieutenant Joyce exits and a
          surgeon follows a moment later.

          
          DECKER: What's he saying?

          
          JOYCE: He's talking but he's not making any sense. Something about a
          place called Midian.

          
          SURGEON: He's dying. I think he wants to die.

          
          Pause. The surgeon moves on.

          
          DECKER [unobtrusively - to Joyce]: Lieutenant, I know Boone, I know
          how he talks, how he manipulates. Perhaps if the right thing is said
          to this man it'll trigger something...

          
          JOYCE [consider]: No harm in trying.

          
          DECKER: I'll do my best. But I'll need privacy.

          
          Decker enters the room.

          

          61. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT 


          
          Looking in through the room, we see Decker cross the room to the bed
          where Narcisse is lying. Decker says something to the nurse. She
          exits. Decker moves closer to the bed. He reaches into his pocket for
          something and moves out of our sight.

          

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          62. EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. CAB NIGHT/DAY


          
          Montage - Boone drives through the night, and the following day,
          through a landscape which becomes increasingly more desolate.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          63. EXT. ROAD SIGN LATE AFTERNOON


          
          The road sign reads:

          

          'DWYER - 56 MILES'

          
          Boone's car speeds past.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          64. EXT. DIRT ROAD OUTSIDE MIDIAN DAY


          
          Boone's car rolls to a stop. Boone steps out and looks at something
          in the dust. A battered sign. It reads:

          

          'MIDIAN/POPULATION 63'

          
          There is no sign of life.

          
          BOONE: No....oh no...[in despair] No!

          
          His shout echos. The wind blows up a cloud of dust around him. He
          walks through the dust, on the verge of tears. And then...the dust
          clears, and he sees...

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          65. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Necropolis, lying on the other side of a thick expanse of reeds.

          
          Puzzlement overtakes despair. He squints to see more clearly...

          
          The Necropolis is vast. High walls, surrounded by reeds, with the
          tops of mausoleums, showing above it. ALmost a fortressed town.

          
          Boone starts towards it.

          

          66. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY


          
          The sun is low in the sky, the light golden glinting off the gates.
          The reeds sigh. Boone pushes one of the gates open and steps inside.
          His footsteps echo, unnaturally loud in this city of the dead. To
          either side of him, elegant and elaborate mausoleums, running away
          into the distance, with numerous smalls tombs set around and between
          them.

          

          
          The sun finally sinks out of sight. Its final glow dies on the tops
          of the mausoleums. There are already stars overhead.

          
          Boone walks on a little way, as the night sounds begin. Exhausted,
          he sits down on a tomb and leans back against the stone.

          
          BOONE [softly - a bitter irony]: Dead ... all of the dead ...

          
          He rummages for a cigarette in his jacket pocket. Pulls one out.
          Lights it. The flame seems to excite sounds around him. He looks up.
          The walkways are empty in both directions.

          
          There's a guttural sound at his back. He stands, drops the
          cigarette, backs away. From the darkness behind him steps a huge
          form. A knife is put to his lower belly. Its wielder, Kinski, is a
          massive man, face distorted, his features grotesquely bifurcated.

          
          KINSKI [whispers]: Move and I gut you.

          
          Boone stays still. The growling from between the tombs becomes words.

          
          VOICE [from the darkness]: You got him?

          
          KINSKI: I got him.

          
          A reptilian hand reaches out and picks up Boone's dropped cigarette.

          
          BOONE: Midian? Are you from Midian?

          
          KINSKI: We should take him below, Peloquin.

          
          The silhouette of Peloquin, a were-creature, moves between the
          tombs. He draws on the cigarette. By its brightening point we glimpse
          an extraordinary face: more animal than human, but no recognizable
          species.

          
          PELOQUIN: He's not Nightbreed. He's Natural.

          
          BOONE: No! I've killed people, I'm like you, that's why I'm here...

          
          PELOQUIN: Shut the fuck up. You're meat.

          
          KINSKI: If we eat him we break the Law.

          
          BOONE: My God...my God, it's true ...

          
          PELOQUIN: Of course it's true. Everything's true ... [he starts to
          emerge from the shadows] God's an astronaut. Oz is over the rainbow.
          And Midian's where the monsters live. And you came to die.

          
          BOONE: I didn't...didn't come to die. I came to be with you, I'm one
          of you.

          
          Peloquin reaches out and touches Boone's chest.

          
          PELOQUIN: No. Sorry. I can smell innocence at fifty yards.

          
          BOONE: I've killed people. Fifteen people.

          
          PELOQUIN: Who told you that?

          
          BOONE: What do you mean?

          
          PELOQUIN: He lied, asshole. He lied. You're a Natural. And that
          means...you're meat for the Beast.

          
          Peloquin growls, throwing his head back and forth with a strange
          grace, the image flickering as he does so. Boone watches, amazed. In
          the blur of Peloquin's motion he transforms, the tentacles on his
          head lengthening and thickening, thrashing around as though they have
          a life of their own.

          
          He moves towards Boone, taking hold of him and tearing his T-shirt
          open.

          
          KINSKI: We mustn't. It's the Law. They'll exile us...

          
          PELOQUIN: Fuck the Law! I want meat!

          
          He bites Boone's neck, tearing at his flesh.

          
          KINSKI: Peloquin, no!

          
          Kinski takes the knife from Boone's belly and pushes Peloquin aside.
          Boone slips away from them.

          
          PELOQUIN: Damn you!

          
          He races after Boone, who runs blindly, his hand pressed to the
          wound on his neck.

          

          66A. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          The Breed listen. We track running feet past the grille, and move
          close into grille, dropping through a dark rock face.

          

          67. SCENE DELETED

          

          67A. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          In the deep darkness faces look up. The faces are strange and
          freakish. There is a woman locked in the embrace of a dark monster. A
          monstrous baby cries.

          

          68. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone takes refuge against a mausoleum wall. He takes his hand from
          the wound on his neck. It is throbbing like a living thing, spreading
          across his muscle. He stares down at the wound, then touches it
          lightly. It gives him pleasure.

          
          A sound above him. He looks up. Peloquin is climbing down the
          mausoleum wall, mouth opened wide to take off Boone's head.
          Boone throws himself forward as the jaws snap shut, missing him by
          inches. He runs. Kinski appears in his path. For an instant Boone
          thinks the game's up...

          
          KINSKI: That way! The gate's that way!

          
          Boone sprints.

          

          69. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          The monsters watch and listen.

          

          70. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES NIGHT


          
          Peloquin pushes Kinski aside and pelts after Boone, who is at the
          gate. He flings himself through, and slams it behind him. Peloquin is
          at the gate, when Kinski comes up behind and restrains him.

          
          KINSKI: He's gone, give it up! You don't dare go out there!

          
          Peloquin stares at Boone through the gate. Panting, sweating, Boone
          stares back. Snorting with frustration, Peloquin recedes, he and
          Kinski disappear into shadow.

          
          Boone heaves a sigh of relief, turns from the gate and trudges away
          into the darkness, when suddenly . . .

          

          71. EXT. OUTSIDE NECROPOLIS GATES NIGHT


          
          Harsh lights hit Boone from every side; police cars in the reeds all
          around, their searchlights focused on him. Two dozen cops, all
          levelling firearms.

          
          JOYCE: Freeze! Right there!

          
          Boone squints against the glare.

          
          JOYCE [cont.]: Aaron Boone, you're under arrest. Hands on your head!

          NOW!

          
          Boone takes a step back. The wound on his neck throbs and swells. At
          the edge of the light, Decker appears, stepping towards him. 

          
          DECKER: Boone, listen to him, it's no use!

          
          JOYCE [to Decker]: Stay back!

          
          DECKER [lowers his voice]: Lieutenant, I can bring him out. He'll
          listen to me.

          
          Joyce ponders, then signals him forward. Decker advances toward Boone.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: Boone, it's all right, I've explained everything to
          them.

          
          Rifles are cocked on every side. Decker stops a safe distance from
          Boone.

          
          DECKER [cont.]: They won't harm you, I give you my word.

          
          BOONE [hanging back]: I didn't do it. I didn't hurt anyone...

          
          DECKER [lowering his voice]: Of course you didn't.

          
          BOONE: You...you believe me?

          
          DECKER: You wouldn't hurt a fly. [extends a hand] Come on, Boone.
          It's safe, I've seen to that.

          
          BOONE [taking a tentative step forward]: What, what about the pills?

          
          DECKER [pause; whispers]: What about them, Boone?

          
          BOONE: They weren't tranquillizers...

          
          A look of alarm crosses Decker's face. Boone reads it. He gets the
          picture.

          
          BOONE [cont.]: You set me up...you bastard, you set me up!

          
          He lunges for Decker, who turns and throws himself to the ground as
          he yells.

          
          DECKER: He's got a gun!

          

          JOYCE: FIRE!

          
          The bullets fly. Boone is about to pounce on Decker when he's hit by
          a barrage, thrown back, riddled with bullets. On the ground, Decker
          covers his head. Boone goes down. The volley ends.

          

          72. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          The sound of gunfire echoes through the walkways.

          

          73. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          In the shadows, a baby held in the arms of a woman with monstrous
          but beautiful features, begins to cry.

          

          74. EXT. OUTSIDE MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          Joyce hears the sound of crying and looks up. Boone's body lies on
          the ground. Decker rises, hearing the distant sobs on the wind.

          

          75. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          The mother hushes the child, her arms, which are tentacles, wrapping
          around it.

          

          76. EXT. OUTSIDE MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          The sound of crying is lost. Joyce moves forward, towards Decker and
          Boone.

          
          JOYCE [trying to convince himself]: ...just the wind. He reaches
          Decker, looks down at Boone's body. Looks around.

          
          JOYCE [cont.]: Where's the gun?

          
          DECKER [seemingly dismayed]: He reached into his jacket...I thought
          I saw it, I swear...oh God, Boone...

          
          JOYCE [quietly, to some cops, meaning Boone]: Get him outta here.

          

          77. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          We track towards a tomb, on which the epitaph reads: 'GOD IS MERCIFUL'

          FADE IN:

          

          78. INT. MORGUE/VIEWING ROOM NIGHT


          
          Moving with Lori, flanked by Dr Burton the pathologist, and a grim
          Joyce. They enter a smaller room. Burton flips a switch. Curtains
          part in front of a thick glass panel, revealing a small, sterile
          viewing chamber.

          
          In the chamber are a morgue attendant and, lying on a stainless
          steel table, Boone's body. Lori looks at the body with heartbreaking
          sadness. She nods. Burton closes the curtains. Lori and Joyce exit.
          On the other side of the glass, the attendant rolls Boone on the
          table towards a door marked 'Pathology'.

          

          79. INT. INTERVIEW ROOM NIGHT


          
          Dr Decker sits alone, looking into his briefcase. The door opens,
          Lori and Joyce enter. Decker closes the briefcase, rises, aggrieved,
          takes both of Lori's hands in his, speaks soothingly.

          
          DECKER: Lori, I'm Dr Decker. Boone was my patient.

          
          LORI: Yes. Hello.

          
          DECKER: I'm so sorry for your loss. I must tell you, you meant the
          world to Aaron. He spoke of you constantly ...

          
          LORI [withdrawing her hand - has the creeps]: Thank you, Doctor.

          
          Lori sits across a table from Joyce. Decker sits against the wall.

          
          JOYCE: Miss Winston, are you sure you wouldn't rather postpone...

          
          LORI: No. Let's get it over with.

          
          Joyce turns on a tape recorder on the table.

          
          JOYCE [starting at the beginning]: What was your relationship with
          Aaron Boone?

          
          LORI [pause]: We were lovers.

          
          We move in on the revolving reels of the tape recorder.

          
          JOYCE: How long had you known Aaron Boone?

          
          LORI: Two months.

          

          80. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          Burton and the attendant, instruments laid out, Boone's body on a
          brightly lit steel table, ready for the autopsy. Burton activates an
          overhead microphone.

          
          BURTON: Deceased is a white Caucasian male, late twenties. Suspected
          cause of death, multiple gunshot wounds to the thoracic cavity and
          extremities.

          
          The attendant lifts up Boone's jacket. Light streams through many
          bullet holes.

          
          ASSISTANT: Jesus. They weren't takin' any chances.

          
          Burton picks up a small digging tool and zeroes in on one of the
          chest wounds.

          
          BURTON: Wound number one: entered between the fourth and fifth left
          ribs, impacted the lower rib, lodging in ligaments adjacent to the
          left lung ...

          
          He digs.

          

          81. INT. INTERVIEW ROOM NIGHT


          
          JOYCE: So he never gave any indication ...

          
          LORI: No ...

          
          JOYCE: Surely there must have been something ...

          
          LORI [firm, angry]; Look, you can say whatever you want to about
          him. I don't believe it. He never raised a hand to me, he
          never harmed anyone in his life.

          
          A strained silence. Decker drums his fingers on his briefcase.

          
          DECKER: Miss Winston, everyone has their secret faces ...

          
          LORI: Drop dead.

          
          Annoyed at Decker, Joyce turns off the tape recorder.

          
          JOYCE: We'll continue this some other time.

          
          Lori stands and heads for the door.

          

          82. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          A pair of callipers drop a distended bullet into a steel bowl,
          containing at least ten other similarly maimed bullets. Fatigued with
          effort, Burton wipes his forehead, turns off the microphone.

          
          BURTON: Coffee break.

          
          The attendant turns off the bright overheads, he and Burton move
          into an adjoining lounge.

          

          83. INT. MORGUE ENTRY WAY NIGHT


          
          Lori is putting on her coat. A contrite Decker approaches her.

          
          DECKER: Miss Winston, I hope you didn't misinterpret what I said.
          Boone meant a great deal to me ...

          
          LORI: Where did he die? [pause] What was the name of the town?

          
          DECKER: A place called Midian.

          85. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          The bowl wobbles on the ground. The bullets roll off in different
          directions. Sound of glass breaking.

          

          86. INT. MORGUE ENTRY WAY NIGHT


          
          Hearing the breaking glass, Lori and Decker turn back towards the
          autopsy room.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          She runs towards the sound, Decker follows.

          

          87. EXT. MORGUE NIGHT


          
          In slow motion, a large first-floor window shatters out towards us.

          

          88. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM NIGHT


          
          As Lori, then Decker enter, moments after Burton, Joyce and the
          attendant. The autopsy table is empty.

          
          BURTON: Someone's taken him...

          
          DECKER: My God...

          
          ATTENDANT [looking around]: Where's his coat?

          

          89. EXT. MORGUE NIGHT


          
          Slow motion  distorting time, we see the rest of the shattering
          window and a dim figure crosses the moon.

          90. INT. LORI'S APARTMENT DAY


          
          Lori hurriedly throws some belongings into a suitcase. We see some
          newspaper clippings beside the suitcase. A headline reads: 'SLASHER

          SUSPECT SLAIN'

          
          Another features a map, showing the location of Midian.

          

          91. EXT. ROAD DAY


          
          Montage - Lori drives, at high speed, down the same roads Boone took
          previously.

          

          92. EXT. SHERE NECK ROAD EVENING


          
          At sunset, Lori enters the town, past a sign that reads: 'WELCOME TO

          SHERE NECK/WELCOME BUFFALO DAYS RODEO'

          

          93. EXT. SHERE NECK MOTEL EVENING


          
          Lori pulls into the parking lot of the motel. A neon sign reads:

          'THE SWEETGRASS INN'

          
          Above it, the moon. From the motel itself, sounds of revelry.

          

          94. INT. MOTEL BAR NIGHT


          
          A wood-panelled, Western Frontier-themed bar. Country music. A
          banner welcomes rodeo participants. A number of rough types
          clustered at tables, many of them wearing baseball caps adorned with
          buffalo horns. Lori enters, looks around. A cowboy lassoes a
          waitress, ropes her in to general applause. Lori takes a seat at the
          bar and is approached by a bartender.

          
          BARTENDER: What'll it be, darlin'?

          
          LORI: A draft and some information please.

          
          BARTENDER [taps a stein of draft]: There's the draft.

          
          LORI [lays down a bill]: I'm looking for a town called Midian.

          
          BARTENDER: You're not the first.

          
          LORI: No?

          
          BARTENDER: Had a bunch of TV news folks passin' through, since they
          nailed that baby-slasher up there.

          
          LORI: Baby-slasher?

          
          BARTENDER: Yeah, hell of a week for us. The rodeo this weekend. That
          scumbag gets blown away. I hear it took thirty slugs to bag that
          sucker. Just goes to show you, don't it? People love a spectacle.

          
          Lori's hit with a burst of emotion. She doesn't want the bartender
          to see her cry.

          
          LORI: Where's the bathroom?

          
          BARTENDER: Right around the corner there, darlin'.

          
          Lori rises, exits.

          

          95. INT. MOTEL BATHROOM DAY


          
          Lori enters and leans on the sink as the grief hits her. She sobs. A
          stall door opens behind her: Sheryl, a girl in her early twenties,
          exits.

          
          Lori pulls a tissue from her bag and tries to compose herself,
          standing back to allow Sheryl access to the mirror, where she studied
          herself before starting to tease her hair.

          
          SHERYL: Which is it, hon', men or money? [Lori looks at her] It's
          usually one or the other, ain't it?

          
          LORI: Oh...[a tiny smile]...A man.

          
          SHERYL: Uh-huh. What'd he do, leave?

          
          LORI: Not exactly.

          
          SHERYL: Jesus, did he come back? That's even worse.

          
          In spite of herself, Lori's brightened by the girl's good humor.

          
          SHERYL [cont.]: Some loser takes a shine to ya, you could toss
          'em in the river tied to a piano he'll come back faster than a dog
          with a bone. Thing is, why go to all this trouble to look so good if
          there's nobody to admire the end product, am I right?

          
          LORI: Can't argue with that, [likes her, feeling lonely] Can I buy
          you a drink?

          
          SHERYL: Hell, yes you can. Better than gettin' hit on by some
          damn buffalo.

          Lori and Sheryl at the bar. Lori's nursing a beer. Sheryl's into her
          fourth Black Russian and is getting friendlier by the moment.

          
          SHERYL [pause - just heard the story]: Lord. I have seen men go to
          great lengths to walk out on a girl. But, I must say, I have never
          heard tell of a fella doin' it while deceased.

          
          LORI: They think some sick bastard's stole the body.

          
          SHERYL: So you want to go check out the place in which he checked out?

          
          LORI: Yeah. Guess it's a way to say goodbye, you know? He was always
          a mystery to me. I loved him...[she looks away]

          
          SHERYL: Tell you what, Lori, why don't I drive up there to this
          Medium place with you tomorrow and keep you company?

          
          LORI: You don't have to do that.

          
          SHERYL: Yeah, but I'm goin' to and I don't want no argument from you.

          
          LORI [smiles, grateful]: Okay. Thanks.

          
          SHERYL: That's all right.

          
          LORI [finishes her beer]: Guess I'll head up to my room.

          
          SHERYL: You get some rest, sugar. I'm gonna stay down here and close
          this damn bar. Maybe one of these lunkheads'll win the 
          lottery.

          
          Lori smiles, squeezes her hand, exits the bar. Sheryl looks around,
          finishes her drink. The bartender sets another drink down in front of
          her.

          
          BARTENDER: Courtesy of that gent in the suit at the end of the
          bar.

          
          Sheryl looks down the bar, sees the man, seems impressed, waves.

          
          SHERYL [low, to the bartender]: Isn't he just the picture of
          sophistication though?

          

          96A. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          We Cut to a wide shot of the Necropolis by night. A shooting star
          falls.

          
          Now we move in on one of the mausoleums, and from the ground below
          we hear a ritualistic chanting.

          
          Once within the darkness of the mausoleum the camera slides down
          over the rock face into the depths of Midian. The volume of the
          chanting increases as we come close to its source.

          

          96B. INT. MURAL CHAMBER


          
          We come into the mural chamber, the camera passing down over the
          family tree of Naturals and Nightbreed and round to see Rachel and
          Kinski approaching and entering the door of the initiation chamber.

          
          Cut to Narcisse and Boone, also approaching the chamber.

          
          NARCISSE: You'll like this. No, really. It's just their way of
          welcoming you to the club.

          
          BOONE: I'm not sure I want to be a member.

          
          NARCISSE: You made your way back here for the same reasons I did. We
          belong here now. There's nowhere else on earth would
          take us in.

          

          CUT TO:

          

          96C. INT. INITIATION CHAMBER


          
          In the middle of the chamber is a kind of font, on which stands a
          bowl of Baphomet's blood, steaming and bubbling. Standing in front of
          it is Lylesburg. To his side Peloquin. Beside him, Rachel.

          
          On Lylesburg's other side, Ohnaka. Standing around the walls as
          witnesses to the ceremony, are a variety of Breed.

          
          Boone enters. The Breed all look his way. Boone sees Shuna Sassi.

          
          BOONE [to Narcisse in a whisper]: Who is she?

          
          NARCISSE: Shuna Sassi. Why?

          
          BOONE: I dreamt her.

          
          Shuna leans towards Peloquin.

          
          SHUNA SASSI: I've dreamt him.

          
          Narcisse nudges Boone forward.

          
          LYLESBURG: Who is your advocate?

          
          NARCISSE: I am.

          
          LYLESBURG: Have you tutored him in the Law?

          
          BOONE: Yes he has.

          
          LYLESBURG: Let the advocate answer.

          
          NARCISSE: Yes I have.

          
          LYLESBURG: You understand what you do, becoming one of us? With this
          night you turn your back on the Natural World. The
          life you lived will after this be as a dream.

          
          BOONE: I know.

          
          Lylesburg takes the glove off his right hand. The flesh beneath is
          cauterized.

          
          LYLESBURG: The blood of the God tells all truths. It can harm as
          easily as heal. Are you prepared to be judged?

          
          BOONE: I'm ready.

          
          Lylesburg nods, and puts his hand into the bowl of the blood. The
          blood bubbles around his wrist.

          
          We cut to Peloquin and Shuna Sassi, who are watching Boone intently.

          
          Boone's eyes are now on Lylesburg's smoking hand as it approaches
          Boone's chest, still marked by his wounds.

          
          LYLESBURG: Be judged.

          
          He puts his hand on the bullet wounds. Boone stiffens. But there's
          no pain. When Lylesburg's hand is removed, the wounds have gone.
          There's a visible release of tension on the faces of all those
          watching.

          
          LYLESBURG: Aaron Boone, in the name of Baphomet, Lord of the tribes
          of the moon, I bid you welcome...

          
          The camera moves out of the chamber, and towards the mural.

          Lori lies awake in bed, staring at the ceiling. Outside, and next
          door, the noise of laughter and partying.

          
          LORI [quietly, a tear in her eye]: I still love you, Boone...

          wearing dark glasses and a horned Buffalo Days hat. The bartender
          pours her an eye-opener.

          
          BARTENDER: Hair of the dog.

          
          Lori enters.

          
          SHERYL: Hi.

          
          LORI: How's your head?

          
          SHERYL: My momma always used to say, 'Sheryl Ann, there's a man out
          walking around with your name on his mind, all you got to do is run
          into him.'

          
          LORI: And he just happened to be checked in here at the crossroads
          of the world.

          
          SHERYL: Isn't that something? His name is Curtis, he is a banker,
          recently divorced and recently relocated in Edmonton, up for the
          rodeo and better yet, he thinks I am the Queen-bee's knees.

          
          LORI: Sheryl, you sure you want to come along?

          
          SHERYL: Wouldn't miss it. Besides, Curtis has to do business today,
          we've got an engagement for this evening and if I sit
          around all day with this head on I'm gonna feel like the hind end
          of a dog sled.

          
          LORI: I'm glad for your company.

          100. EXT. MIDIAN/INT. LORI'S CAR DAY


          
          Lori's car comes to a stop near the edge of the reeds outside the
          Necropolis.

          
          SHERYL: Jesus. Looks like the gold rush is over.

          
          Lori parks the car. She gets out, looks around.

          
          LORI [quiet - reflective]: Why? Why would Boone come here?

          
          SHERYL: To get away from it all? [Lori gives her a look] Shut up,
          Sheryl Ann. You go do what you have to do. I'll stay here and...do
          somethin' else.

          
          Lori nods and heads away down the street, leaving Sheryl beside the
          car. She leans against the car, surveys the emptiness, without
          enthusiasm.

          
          SHERYL [cont.]: My luck, I'll end up buying some real estate.

          

          101. EXT. MIDIAN DAY


          
          Lori - as she leaves the reeds and sees the outer walls of the
          Necropolis.

          
          LORI: Good God...

          

          102. EXT. MIDIAN DAY


          
          Sheryl - wandering from the car into the reeds. She lights a
          cigarette, tunelessly humming to ward off the willies. She stops,
          shivers, suddenly feeling very isolated. The atmosphere's got to her.
          She starts back to the car.

          
          She catches some movement out of the corner of her eye. Stops.
          Slowly walks away from the movement, fighting off panic. She
          turns a corner, and realizes she's lost in the reeds.

          
          She hears movement behind her, turns, startled, then, oddly, she
          smiles.

          
          SHERYL: Curtis ... what are you doing here?

          
          It's Decker, looking like a commuter, hair slicked back, wearing an
          overcoat, carrying his briefcase.

          
          DECKER [big smile]: Hello, Sheryl Ann.

          

          103. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY


          
          Lori reaches the gates, slightly breathless. She pushes one of them
          open. The sun is hot and bright, transforming the Necropolis from the
          dark, dangerous place it was when Boone was here. Now, with its
          gothic tombs and burgeoning plant life, it's almost welcoming.

          

          104. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori wanders the walkways, enchanted by the splendor of the place.
          There are strange, bittersweet sights along the way: statues of dogs
          sleeping on their masters' graves; of mourning mothers; of children,
          sitting at their graves. And grotesque images too: gargoyles
          protecting the doorways of mausoleums; a tiger, roaring in stone. It
          is another world, solemn and silent.

          
          Except...suddenly, the sound of an animal in pain. Lori stops and
          looks around. Her gaze comes to rest on a spreading laurel tree
          beneath which the shadows are pitch black. From here, the sobbing
          comes. She approaches. There is an animal beneath the tree, barely
          discernible. She can see its flanks panting, its head moving in pain.

          
          LORI: Jesus...

          
          It doesn't look like a recognizable species, an amalgam of wild cat
          and deer. She approaches. It raises its head, weakly. Its eyes are
          huge and black.

          
          LORI [cont.]: ...It's okay, I won't hurt you...it's okay...

          
          The creature shudders.

          
          LORI [cont.]: ...What's happened to you?...Let me see.

          
          She reaches beneath the branches and tentatively strokes the animal.
          It responds by dropping its head back on to the grass.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Oh God...you poor thing...don't die, please don't die.

          
          She pushes beneath the tree, puts her arms beneath the creature and
          picks it up. It is heavy, a dead weight in her arms. She backs out
          from beneath the tree. As she steps back into the sun, the creature
          snarls and starts to wither in her arms. She realizes what's causing
          it pain and steps back into shadow.

          
          LORI [cont.]: You don't like the sun? Is that it?

          
          The sound of sobbing, off to her left, draws her attention. One of
          the mausoleum doors is open, and a woman, Rachel, dressed in black,
          stands in the shadows, weeping. Lori's astonished.

          
          LORI [cont.]: I'm sorry...is, is it yours?

          
          RACHEL: Bring her. Bring her, please.

          
          Shading the creature from the sun, Lori moves to the door and steps
          into the gloom.

          

          105. INT. MAUSOLEUM DAY


          
          The interior is marble, the air murky. Rachel, a fine-boned, pre-
          Raphaelite beauty in her thirties, moves back against the far wall,
          nursing a wounded arm.

          
          Lori looks down at the creature she's carrying, utterly limp in her
          arms.

          
          LORI: ...I'm afraid it's too late.

          
          RACHEL: No...she can't die. Bring her to me, please.

          
          Rachel reaches out. Lori's reluctant to move further into the
          darkness.

          
          RACHEL: Hurry!

          
          As Lori crosses the floor, she hears whispering from a stairway that
          leads down into the earth. She stops, frightened.

          
          RACHEL: Pay no attention. Please, bring me my Babette.

          
          As the creature is named it starts to move in Lori's arms. Not only
          move, but change. Its claws grab at Lori's breast as it writhes.

          
          RACHEL [cont.]: Babette, no!

          
          LORI: What's happening?

          
          RACHEL: Don't look! Don't look!

          
          But Lori can't help but look. Appalled, she tries to pull the
          transforming creature off her, but its hold is firm.

          
          LORI: Jesus! Jesus!

          
          With effort, she detaches the creature's claws from her, almost
          throwing it at Rachel, who cradles the changing creature in her arms.

          
          RACHEL: Babette...

          
          Lori leans against the wall, trying to wipe the sticky fluids the
          creature's exuded onto her hands. When she looks up she sees the
          creature in Rachel's arms has transformed into a pale, beautiful girl
          of seven or eight. Lori's dumbstruck.

          
          LORI: What...what...what the...?

          
          RACHEL: She likes to play outside. I tell her: you mustn't play in
          the sun. The sun will hurt you. But she's just a child. She doesn't
          understand.

          
          Lori looks back towards the open door, and the sun-drenched walkway
          outside. Then back at Babette.

          
          LORI: This is too weird.

          
          RACHEL [an urgent whisper]: You saved her. I owe you
          something...listen; I know why you came here.

          
          LORI: You do?

          
          RACHEL: You must go, this place is not for you. Midian is a home for
          the Nightbreed. Only for the Nightbreed.

          
          LORI: Is Boone here? Did somebody bring him here?

          
          A deep baritone voice rises up from the shadows of the stairwell.

          
          LYLESBURG: Rachel...you have said too much already.

          
          Lylesburg appears, a commanding, magisterial man with a vast grey
          beard and three slits on each cheek that look like gills. Loping
          along beside him, his fool, a muscular man with an innocently
          beautiful face: Ohnaka.

          
          RACHEL: My Lylesburg, she brought me Babette, she saved her . . .

          
          LYLESBURG: We know. But you cannot help her.

          
          LORI [her spunk surfacing]: Look, I saved the child's life, don't I
          deserve something for that?

          
          LYLESBURG: The child has no life to save, [he looks at her - sizes
          her up] But what she has is yours, if you want it. That's the Law. Do
          you want her?

          
          LORI: No! I just want some answers.

          
          LYLESBURG: You weren't meant to see this.

          
          LORI: I kind of got that impression.

          
          LYLESBURG: Then you also understand that to speak of this to anyone
          will bring dire consequences . . .

          
          LORI: Hey, pal, don't threaten me.

          
          LYLESBURG: Not for you. For us.

          
          His words take the edge off Lori's anger. She notices that inscribed
          in the marble arch above the doorway are the words:

          'WHAT'S BELOW REMAINS BELOW'

          
          LYLESBURG [cont.]: What's below remains below. This is the Law.

          
          Rachel is carrying Babette down the steps. Lylesburg turns to follow
          her.

          
          LORI: Wait! Wait a minute! Boone, Aaron Boone, just tell me, is he
          here? You took him, you took his body, didn't you? Hey!

          
          Lori crosses to the stairs. Lylesburg's disappeared down into the
          darkness.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Talk to me, damn it, I have to know - come back!

          

          105A. INT. MAUSOLEUM STAIRWELL


          
          Lori heads down the stairs.

          
          LORI: Come back!

          
          Lylesburg, Ohnaka, Rachel and Babette have gone, however. Lori
          continues her descent. There are sounds in the darkness below her.
          She stops, and looks back towards the top of the stairs. It's a long
          way off.

          
          LORI [to herself]: How deep does this go?

          
          She heads on down, turning a corner. In front of her, Peloquin. He
          starts towards her. She backs away, into a second creature, and
          starts up the stairs. As she does so a third creature swings down
          from the darkness above her head. She shrieks, and runs like hell.

          
          PELOQUIN [calls after her]: Come back soon, y'hear?

          

          106. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori emerges, squinting against the blinding sun, trying to calm
          herself.

          
          LORI: Okay. Walk away, Lori. Don't panic. There's got to be a
          perfectly reasonable explanation, [can't sustain it] And hell if I
          know what it is.

          
          She sprints back towards the gate.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          107. EXT. MIDIAN DAY


          
          Out of breath, Lori reaches the car, parked where she left it. No
          sign of Sheryl.

          
          LORI: Sheryl! Sheryl! Let's get the hell out of here! [no reply]
          Sheryl?

          
          Lori looks around. Sees Sheryl's purse in the dirt near the reeds.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Sheryl?

          
          She moves towards the reeds. Picks up the purse. Peers inside the
          house. She hears a gurgling laugh from inside. It could be Sheryl.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Sheryl, come on ...

          

          108. EXT. REEDS DAY


          
          The undergrowth is dark and empty. Lori advances cautiously through
          the paths.

          
          LORI: Sheryl, we have to go, uh, something's kind of come up and...

          
          She sees a splash of blood on the reeds.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Oh shit. . .

          
          Something moves across our field of vision in the gloom behind her.
          She turns.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Sheryl?

          
          She turns back and follows the trail of blood around the corner,
          Lying on the floor is Sheryl. Mouth cut away. Tongue cut off.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Jesus! God!

          
          She turns to run, but Decker steps into her path. He wears a mask of
          repulsive simplicity: a linen face with two buttons for eyes and a
          zipper [open at present] for a mouth. In his hands are two large
          carving knives, both blood-stained.

          
          DECKER: Let's get it over with, shall we?

          
          LORI [mind racing, a survivor]: Take it easy, let's talk about this.

          
          DECKER [advancing]: Don't try and reason with me, Lori. I'm a
          lunatic. You don't reason with lunatics.

          
          LORI: How do you know my name?

          
          DECKER: Good question. No reason why you shouldn't have an answer.
          [he pulls off the mask] Wish I had a camera. Oh, the look a your face.

          
          LORI: Why? Why did you kill her?

          
          DECKER: Why did I kill all the others? For the fun of it, of course.
          For pleasure. Everyone ought to have a hobby, don't you agree?

          
          LORI: Boone was innocent.

          
          DECKER: Is innocent, wherever he's hiding. After all the trouble I
          went to to find him a home for his guilt.

          
          LORI: You sick motherfucker...

          
          DECKER: Boone's alive, Lori. And your death is going to bring him
          out of hiding.

          
          He comes at her suddenly, but his heel slides in Sheryl's blood. He
          falls in front of Lori, and stabs at her feet. She avoids the stab by
          an inch. He rises suddenly, throws one of his knives aside and grabs
          the blade Lori holds, with a glove which strikes sparks. It is
          chainmail. Lori lets go, propelling herself through the reeds.

          110. INT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          The light is diminishing behind the Necropolis walls. Lori's screams
          are distant. We track towards the gate as she runs down the hill.

          
          LORI: Somebody help me!

          
          She flings the gate open and enters. Decker emerges from the reeds
          behind her.

          

          111. SCENE DELETED

          

          111A. INT. THE TEMPLE OF BAPHOMET


          
          The temple is an impressive chamber, at the centre of which is a
          dais, ringed with representatives of the six failed saviours of Breed.

          
          In the middle of the ring, a statue of Baphomet. There are benches
          along the walls. Sitting in them, reciting in soft, sibilant voices
          the Laws of Midian, are Breed.

          
          Lylesburg, accompanied by Ohnaka, is also in the chamber, as is
          Boone, being held by the Breed.

          
          BOONE: I have to help her!

          
          LYLESBURG: You can't go.

          
          BOONE: I'll kill him. No-one will ever know.

          
          LYLESBURG: What's below remains below.

          
          BOONE: I can't let her die.

          
          LYLESBURG: When we took you in you made an oath to obey the Law.

          
          BOONE: I won't listen to him butcher her. I love her.

          
          LYLESBURG: She's a Natural. She couldn't love you back. Not now.

          
          BOONE: Wrong!

          
          He starts to struggle against his captors, fighting them off.

          
          BOONE: You're wrong!

          
          Throwing one back, and punching the other, Boone breaks for the door.

          
          LYLESBURG: Boone! Boone!

          
          Lylesburg's shout is ignored, as Boone heads up to the surface.

          

          112. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Lori runs down the walkways pursued by Decker, her breath coming in
          gasps, close to collapse.

          
          LORI: Help me! Oh please, God, somebody.

          

          113. SCENE DELETED

          

          114. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Lori collapses. Decker reaches her and pulls on his mask.

          
          DECKER: That's good. Be still. It's quicker that way.

          
          He pulls a particularly nasty blade from his jacket interior and
          advances. She rises and tries to duck the cut. He strikes her with
          the back of his hand. She falls, striking her head on a tomb.

          
          DECKER [cont.] [sudden fury]: I said, be still!

          
          Lori is semi-conscious, blood running from her wounded head. Looking
          past Decker, she sees something...

          
          LORI: Boone...

          
          Decker laughs. Then he realizes she's reacting to the appearance of
          Boone, standing in the shadows behind him, in jeans and leather
          jacket.

          
          Lori slips into unconsciousness.

          
          DECKER: You? Here again?

          
          BOONE: Isn't this where the dead are supposed to go?

          
          DECKER: You're not dead.

          
          BOONE [advancing]: You're wrong. We're both dead, Decker.

          
          DECKER: I'm not Decker!

          
          BOONE: No? Isn't that you, Dr Decker, hiding behind that child's mask?

          
          DECKER: I'm not hiding...

          
          BOONE [still advancing, taunting him]: Decker, Decker. Doctor Decker.

          
          Enraged, Decker throws the knife; it buries in the middle of Boone's
          chest. Decker laughs, then stops, as Boone pulls the knife out and
          tosses it aside.

          
          BOONE [cont.]: Blades are no better than bullets, Decker, don't you
          get it? I'm dead. The walking dead.

          
          DECKER: That's not possible.

          
          Decker turns to run, but Boone races to him, catches, turns him
          and pulls Decker closer, until they're nose to nose.

          
          BOONE: Not just dead...changed. A monster. Want me to show you?

          
          DECKER [whimpering]: No, please ...

          
          BOONE: Not your kind of monster. Not the soulless kind. I've got
          Midian in my veins.

          
          He tears off the mask, uncovering Decker's sweaty, terrified face.

          
          DECKER: Please, please, it's, it's not my fault, it's the mask, it
          makes me do things I don't want to...[Boone pulls him closer] Boone,
          it was the mask and they were going to find me, punish me, I needed a
          scapegoat...

          
          BOONE: You chose the wrong man.

          
          NARCISSE [V.O.]: Man? You call yourself a man?

          
          Boone looks round; Narcisse is squatting on a tomb, his face a mass
          of scar tissue.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: You're no more man than I am.

          
          BOONE: Monster, then.

          
          NARCISSE: That's more like it. [he jumps off the tomb, moves towards
          them] Well, go on, are you going to kill him or not? Only I want his
          balls. And his eyes. That is, if you don't want them.

          
          BOONE: I'll pass.

          
          NARCISSE: Remember me, Doctor? I was dying when you had your way
          with me. You made me tell my secrets when I was feeling particularly
          vulnerable. Now was that a nice thing for a doctor to do?

          
          DECKER [to Boone, craven]: Oh God, Boone, don't let him touch me,
          anything, keep him off me, full confession...sweet Jesus, mercy,
          mercy, please, I'm begging you!

          
          Narcisse raises his thumbs, still bearing their silver hooks.

          
          NARCISSE: Let's start with his eyes ...

          
          BOONE: No!

          
          Boone pushes Narcisse back, but as he does so Decker slips his
          grasp. Boone roars and starts to twitch and stamp as Peloquin did and
          we watch as...

          
          Boone transforms into something part man, part carnivore...and gives
          chase.

          
          Decker nears the gate, but Boone is after him at great speed,
          leaping over tombs like a high-jumper.

          

          115. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Left behind, Narcisse turns his eyes upon the recumbent Lori.

          
          NARCISSE [filled with hunger, greatly consoled): Well...you'll do.

          
          As he advances on her, Lori's eyes flicker open. She screams.

          

          116. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Boone right on Decker's tail; he hears Lori's screams and stops.
          Decker runs out through the gate. Boone starts back towards Lori.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          117. EXT. NECROPOLIS LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Lori struggling in Narcisse's arms. He tries to muffle her.

          
          Boone leaps tombs, nearing their location. He bounds into the
          clearing, sees Lori unconscious in Narcisse's embrace. 

           

          
          BOONE: Let her go! 

           

          
          Narcisse, all sheepish co-operation, gently lets her go onto the
          ground.

          
          NARCISSE: Just...keeping her warm.

          

          
          Boone is almost human now. He reaches Lori.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: I wouldn't have touched her.

          
          Boone breathes in the last of his monstrous condition, and bends to
          tenderly stroke Lori's face. Then, very lightly, he kisses her, and
          gathers her in his arms.

          

          FADE OUT:

          

          FADE IN:

          118A. INT. LYLESBURG'S CHAMBER


          
          BOONE: I had no choice.

          
          LYLESBURG: You've put us all in danger for your love of this woman.

          
          BOONE: Decker can't tell anyone. What's he going to say? That
          he tried to kill a girl and a dead man stopped him?

          
          LYLESBURG: He can still lead our enemies here. If he goes - if
          Midian's unearthed  you're responsible.

          
          BOONE: So let me make amends.

          
          LYLESBURG: Just take the girl and go on your way amongst the
          Naturals. That's the Law.

          
          BOONE: Who made this Law?

          
          LYLESBURG: Baphomet. The God in Obsidian. Who made Midian.

          
          BOONE: So maybe I should speak to this guy.

          
          LYLESBURG: Baphomet is a spirit in stone. He doesn't speak, or move.
          His wounds are too great...

          
          BOONE: What are you afraid of?

          
          LYLESBURG: What Baphomet made he has the power to unmake. His blood
          is volatile. He mustn't be angered.

          
          BOONE: Then I'll make nice.

          120. INT. CORRIDOR BY LYLESBURG'S CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          Boone heads down the corridor. He slows as he passes an entrance to
          one side chamber and looks in...

          
          Inside the chamber, a dog-faced man is working on a vast elaborate
          mosaic mural that extends into shadow in both directions. He looks up
          and locks eyes with Boone.

          
          Boone breaks off the contact and continues down the corridor.

          
          The dog-faced man turns back to his palette; a multi-coloured
          collection of small tiles. He carefully selects a few, then turns to
          the mosaic and we see...

          

          121. INT. MURAL CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          The mosaic mural. Prominent in what appears to be a panoramic visual
          history of the Nightbreed race, is a heroic figure who closely
          resembles...Boone. The dog-faced man applies the tiles he's selected,
          filling in the irises of the Boone-figure's eyes.

          

          122. INT. RACHEL'S CHAMBER


          
          Lori sits up.

          
          LORI: Boone...?

          
          Her head aches. She winces. Babette goes to her aid.

          
          BABETTE: Be still. It was a bad hurt he did us.

          
          LORI: Us? What do you mean 'us'?

          
          RACHEL [moving to them]: You held Babette while she transformed.
          She's made quite a bond with you.

          
          BABETTE: I felt your hurt. I still feel it.

          
          RACHEL: She even knew you were coming here. She saw it all, through
          your eyes.

          
          BABETTE: And you can see through mine.

          
          LORI [pause - she tries to read Rachel]: You're not kidding.

          
          RACHEL: It's true.

          
          Lori rises unsteadily to her feet. Babette takes her hand, but
          Rachel moves her away from Lori.

          
          RACHEL [cont.]: She doesn't want you to touch her, sweet. She's
          afraid.

          
          LORI: You got that right. One minute I'm about to get carved like a
          Christmas turkey, the next I'm...I'm...[a surfacing memory breaks her
          train]...God...it was Boone...Boone saved me.

          
          RACHEL: Yes.

          
          LORI: But he's dead, I saw him in the morgue...

          
          RACHEL: You still don't understand, do you?

          
          LORI: Wait a second, back up...

          
          RACHEL: You're below now. With the Nightbreed. The last survivors of
          the great tribes. 

          
          LORI: Tribes of who? What?

          
          RACHEL: We're shapeshifters; freaks; remains of races your species
          have almost driven to extinction.

          
          LORI: So you're not immortal?

          
          RACHEL: Far from it. The sun can kill some of us. Like Babette. She
          follows her father in that. Some of us could be shot down; others
          would survive that because they've got beyond death.

          
          LORI: Horrible. It's all horrible.

          
          RACHEL: To be able to fly? To be smoke, or a wolf; to know the
          night, and live in it forever? That's not so bad. You call us
          monsters, but when you dream, it's of flying and changing, and
          living without death. You envy us. And what you envy...

          
          LORI [softly; understanding]: ...We destroy...

          
          RACHEL [to Babette]: Show her. Show her the past...

          
          Babette touches Lori's arm.

          
          BABETTE: Be with me.

          
          The skulls in front of Lori fill her sight. We fly through one of
          the eye sockets into...

          reads FREAK SHOW, track past the flag to a cage, containing freakish
          Breed.

          
          Well-dressed ordinary men and women applaud and laugh.

          LORI: And...and you're saying...Boone's like you?

          
          RACHEL: He is Nightbreed. Or he was, until he broke the Law.

          
          LORI [moving towards the door]: No, no, that's not possible -
          I've got to find him, there's been some kind of mistake...

          
          BABETTE: Don't go...

          JOYCE: Decker? This better be good.

          
          DECKER: I found Boone.

          
          JOYCE: Someone brought the corpse down here?

          
          DECKER: He's not dead.

          
          JOYCE: I saw him pumped full of bullets.

          
          DECKER: So did I. But he's alive. He killed again...

          
          JOYCE: In Shere Neck?

          
          DECKER: No, out at Midian.

          Lori finds herself in a cavernous space, lined with chambers
          connected by walkways and ladders, which don't look particularly
          secure. She moves out on to a walkway. It leads her into the central
          core of Midian, which offers a view of dizzying descent into the
          earth. She scans the scene, amazed by the sheer scale of the place.

          
          LORI: My God...

          
          As she descends into the bowels of Midian, creatures in various
          doorways watch her with curiosity. One creature seems to have light
          running from wounds on its body. Another tumbles past her, a slow
          acrobat, defying gravity. She sees only a few of these but hears far
          more, chattering and murmuring in the shadows.

          

          127A. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          As Lori moves through the chambers toward Peloquin we see the devil
          creature Lude feeding snakes to his pet, a horned, many legged beast
          which squats on the floor. He gets up and goes to look at her. Leroy,
          a grinning grotesque, appears from the back of the chamber, snatches
          the snake from the maw of the pet, and comes to watch as well.

          
          LEROY [eating the snake]: There goes the neighbourhood.

          reveal...

          
          A ceremony, with the bowls of white blood later seen in Baphomet's
          chamber, is in progress.

          As Lori crosses the bridge something watches from the deep
          shadows...the tone darkens. She steps off the bridge and scorpions
          scuttle away. Lori is now a little nervous. She finds herself in a
          corner with several doors...Through one door she sees a man with a
          white T-shirt. She calls after him.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          Lori enters through the door.

          In a corner a ghastly meal is underway. The Boone figure is heading
          away through another door. Lori follows the figure, and the diners
          get up as if to attack. In the next chamber is a tangle of bright red
          glistening bodies with no heads...Lori glances round. The diners
          pursue her.

          

          128D. INT. MIDIAN CHAMBER


          
          Up ahead of Lori is the Boone figure. She approaches it as it steps
          out of the shadows...

          
          It is not Boone!!

          
          She steps away...

          The red beast is rising behind her. Lori turns and exits the
          chamber, flattening herself against the rock. She advances. Crouched
          in a niche above where she's walking, we see a small lizard-like
          creature, Barabas, eating a dead rat.

          Lori enters the final chamber, following the figure she thinks is
          Boone.

          
          On the far side, crouching at a door, a figure.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          The figure turns. It's Peloquin.

          
          PELOQUIN: No-one here of that name.

          
          She turns. The Boone figure is in the doorway behind her. He has the
          face of a snake.

          
          PELOQUIN: Told you!

          
          He approaches Lori.

          
          PELOQUIN: I know you. He talks about you. Lori.

          
          He snatches a broach from her.

          
          PELOQUIN: Nice. You're still a Natural. Want to join the family? [he
          goes to bite her]

          
          LORI: No!

          
          Peloquin follows her to the door.

          
          PELOQUIN [at door]: You will. Sooner or later you'll want to live
          forever.

          
          He laughs maniacally, returning into his room.

          Lori continues her descent. As she nears the cavern floor, Lylesburg
          steps into her path, beside him his fool, Ohnaka.

          
          LYLESBURG: You may go no further.

          
          LORI: I want Boone!

          
          LYLESBURG: You're not to blame, but you must understand: what
          Boone's done has put us in jeopardy...

          
          LORI: No problem, you tell me where he is and we're outta here...

          
          LYLESBURG: Boone has gone to Baphomet. He is beyond recall.

          
          A low rumbling issues from somewhere deep inside the passage
          Lylesburg stands before. Underneath the rumble is an animal
          moaning with pain.

          
          LORI: Where is he? He's down here isn't he? You want to stop me
          you're gonna have to kill me.

          
          Impressed by her resolve, Lylesburg stands aside. She moves past him
          and heads down into the chamber, towards a distant light. Lylesburg
          gestures after her. Ohnaka nods and follows.

          NARCISSE: Up and about already?

          
          LORI: Keep away from me.

          to kiss it. [Lori moves on past] Don't go down there.

          
          LORI: Why not?

          
          NARCISSE [instant change of subject]: Don't you just love this

          neck.

          
          LORI: Boone went this way, right?

          LORI: He's not dead.

          
          NARCISSE: He's that and more. If you don't believe me, you wait 'til
          he gets to sniff a little blood. That'll bring out the beast in him.
          I'm telling you, don't go...

          Lori starts down the corridor, the walls of which are cracked wide
          in places, the gaps covered with chains. From the other side she
          hears grunts and growls. Then, to her shock, one of the Berserkers'
          arms reaches up from a grille in the floor and snatches at her leg.
          She steps aside to avoid it, and another of the Berserkers' arms
          reaches through the mesh of chains, taking hold of her by the neck.
          It starts to choke her. She shouts for help.

          
          Ohnaka, Lylesburg's fool, appears from down the corridor. He starts
          to rattle the chains further along the wall.

          and get me!

          
          The arm around Lori's neck releases its hold, and we hear the sound
          of the creatures moving along the walls in Ohnaka's direction.

          
          OHNAKA: Fat-asses!

          
          Suddenly, arms reach for him through the chains. He steps away just
          in time.

          below, down a slope in front of them, walls vibrating with the din
          from Baphomet's chamber. Ohnaka withdraws. Blindingly bright light,
          out of which Lori spots a figure climbing towards them.

          
          LORI: Boone? Boone!

          
          She moves down to Boone, scrambling up the slope towards her,
          drenched in sweat, half-mad with terror.

          
          BOONE: Don't...don't look...

          
          He reaches for her, then collapses. She starts down the slope to
          him. Dust falls from the roof, the din makes her reel. But she
          reaches him, starts to haul him to his feet. Then, she looks up and
          we get a glimpse of...

          Out of the blinding light, and seemingly the source of it, a huge,
          black figure turns towards her, twelve feet high, severed limbs
          connected by sinews of hot, white energy and extruded spines, the
          face terrible, wise and beautiful.

          
          Lori's stunned, she averts her eyes. Boone collects himself enough
          to pull her away and they help each other frantically scrabble up the
          slope, out of the chamber.

          

          135. INT. OUTSIDE BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          As Lori and Boone emerge, Ohnaka appears and beckons them to follow.
          Too exhausted and frightened to speak, Boone and Lori
          follow.

          

          

          136. INT. MIDIAN CENTRAL CORE


          
          Ominous rumblings urge them on, as Boone and Lori make a stumbling
          ascent through the core, trailing Ohnaka's urgent lead, watched from
          the doorways by a variety of creatures. We cut to the ledge, and move
          to a chamber, where Peloquin and Shuna Sassi are making love.
          Peloquin hears Lori urging Boone on as they struggle across the
          bridge, and looks away from Shuna, out through the door.

          
          PELOQUIN: Well, well...

          
          He goes to the door.

          
          PELOQUIN [cont.]: Guess he couldn't take the heat.

          
          SHUNA SASSI: I dreamt him. He's strong.

          
          PELOQUIN: That's only because the bite was mine.

          
          SHUNA SASSI: No, don't you see? He's the one from the prophesies.
          Cabal. The seventh saviour.

          
          PELOQUIN: So why's he leaving?

          
          SHUNA SASSI: Everything has its purpose. Maybe he hasn't learned to
          hate his tribe enough. He'll be back.

          
          Peloquin kisses her.

          
          PELOQUIN: Why die waiting?

          

          137. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          The sun climbs over the horizon, sunlight penetrates the graveyard.
          A mausoleum door creaks open, Lori and Boone rush out into the open
          air. Lori tries to lead Boone away, he squints painfully against the
          early light.

          
          BOONE: No, no, I belong here...

          
          LORI [grabs him]: Bullshit! Boone, Boone, listen to me - you belong
          with me, that's why you lived, that's why we survived,
          because we belong together...

          
          Ohnaka swings the door shut behind them. Boone sees Lori, as if for
          the first time. She takes his hand, presses it to her face, her
          breast.

          
          LORI [cont.]: This is me. This is why I followed you, this is what
          we're living for.

          
          His eyes clear. A part of him seems to return. He embraces her.

          
          BOONE: Lori...

          
          LORI: They don't need you. Nobody needs you but me. We'll go away,
          far away, where no-one will ever find us. I love you.

          
          They hold each other.

          

          138. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          

          LONG ANGLE:

          
          Boone and Lori - two small figures, alone among the sepulchres. They
          move towards the gate together.

          Empty streets. No activity. Lori's car pulls into the parking lot.

          

          140. INT. LORI'S CAR DAY


          
          Lori turns to Boone, slumped down in the passenger seat, out of
          sight, wearing sunglasses.

          
          LORI: I'll get my stuff, I'll be back in two minutes...

          
          BOONE: Don't leave me alone.

          
          LORI: Boone...

          
          BOONE [fiercely]: No!

          
          LORI [calmly  trying to hide her alarm]: Okay. We'll go in together.

          
          She hands him the Buffalo Days hat and opens the door.

          

          141. EXT. PHONE BOOTH DAY


          
          From a phone booth across the street we see Lori and Boone move
          towards the motel entrance. In foreground, a chain-mailed hand picks
          up the phone and dials.

          

          142. INT. SWEETGRASS INN DAY


          
          Boone and Lori enter the corridor that leads to her room. Eerie
          silence, save for a dog yapping somewhere. Boone stops. Alarmed, she
          turns to him.

          
          LORI [whispers]: What's wrong?

          
          BOONE: Why is it so empty?

          
          LORI: They must be at the rodeo.

          
          She hurries on, Boone follows, clearly disturbed. Lori unlocks her
          door, glancing back at Boone, who has taken off his sunglasses. There
          is something strange about the light in his eyes. A subtle wave of
          colour passes across his face.

          
          BOONE: I smell blood.

          
          LORI: What?

          
          BOONE: So much blood...

          
          She swings the door open. We expect a horror. Nothing. An ordinary
          room.

          
          LORI: It's okay.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          113. INT. MOTEL LORI'S ROOM DAY


          
          Lori enters and quickly gathers her belongings together.

          
          Boone, sweating with terror, slides down the wall into a squatting
          position.

          
          As Lori packs, she looks down, sees a hole in the wall, the result
          of some massive violence from the other side. She cautiously leans
          down, peers through the hole and quickly retreats, hand over mouth,
          horrified by what she's seen.

          
          LORI: Boone?

          
          Boone appears at the door.

          
          LORI[cont.]: Next door.

          
          Boone goes next door and turns the handle.

          

          144. SCENE DELETED

          

          145. INT. MOTEL MURDER ROOM DAY


          
          Boone pushes the door open. Inside, a massacre: five dead card
          players, propped up around a poker table in a sick parody of a poker
          game tableau; throats slit, Buffalo Hats on their heads. Sitting in
          the middle of the table, a tall, elaborate house of cards.

          
          Boone moves into the middle of the room. On his face we can see the
          hunger he feels. Ripples of color begin to move over his features. He
          moves towards the corpses...as he does so, we hear a nearly deafening
          sound from outside...the vibrations knock over the house of cards
          and...

          

          146. EXT. SWEETGRASS INN DAY


          
          Into the empty street, a helicopter descends, discharging Lieutenant
          Joyce and a platoon of heavily armed Swat Team cops. Local police
          cars pour in.

          
          Captain Eigerman climbs out of his cruiser to survey the siege.
          Decker introduces him to Joyce. Sharpshooters take up positions,
          training their weapons on the motel, as the Swat Team moves in.

          

          147. INT. MOTEL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          Lori moves to the door of the murder room. Boone is inside, his back
          to her.

          
          LORI: It was Decker...Decker did this...

          
          In foreground, Boone's face begins to transform, which Lori can't
          see. She hears the cops outside.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Boone, we have to get out of here.

          
          BOONE: Stay away from me...

          
          LORI: Boone, what is it?

          
          BOONE: I don't want you to see...

          
          LORI: See what?

          
          BOONE: Get out! Do as I say!

          
          LORI: I won't leave you...

          
          As she crosses towards him, he turns. His face is in mid-
          transformation.

          

          148. EXT. SWEETGRASS INN DAY


          
          Lori's scream echoes outside the motel. Joyce orders in the Swat
          Team. They charge, entering the motel.

          

          149. INT. MOTEL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          Lori backs out of the room in horror.

          
          LORI: Oh my God...oh my God...

          
          She hears cops charging up the stairs.

          
          LORI [cont.]: Boone! They're coming!

          The transformed Boone covers his face, slams the room door shut and
          moves towards the bodies.

          
          Lori hides at the end of the corridor as the Swat cops appear at the
          far end.

          
          On his knees, in the middle of some frenzied action we can't quite
          see, Boone stops and looks down at his blood-stained hands.

          
          BOONE: No...No...

          
          Out of sight, Lori watches the cops prepare to storm the room.

          

          150A. INT. MOTEL BATHROOM DAY


          
          Boone enters the bathroom with the sound of the Swat Team's entry to
          the motel on the track. He slams the door. There is blood on his face
          and hands. He goes to the sink and turns on the tap. Then he sees
          himself in the mirror, his transformed face is a shock, He looks at
          himself, appalled. Then a wave of nausea overtakes him. He throws up
          into the sink; a splash of blood and flesh he's just eaten. Wiping
          his mouth with the back of his hands he starts to breathe out his
          condition. His face transforms back to his normal state. He makes a
          sob of horror.

          
          SWAT LEADER (V.O.): In here!

          
          Boone looks towards the door, sinking down against the tiles as he
          does so. The door is flung open. We see him cowering as the Swat Team
          come for him.

          Under cover of the trees and cars around the motel, Lori hides in a
          place where she can view the front of the building.

          
          She sees Eigerman talking with Joyce, Decker behind them. They look
          up as the Swat cops manhandle a hand-cuffed Boone out of the
          building. He has totally reverted to human form, the blood-stains
          seemingly a sure proof of guilt. Lori watches as he's thrown into a
          police car and driven off.

          153. INT. SHERE NECK POLICE STATION DAY


          
          A clank of keys opening locks. A steel door swings open. Three cops
          rough-house Boone down the corridor, Eigerman right behind, passing
          other cells holding prisoners watching them go by. We hold on one, a
          young fundamentalist Baptist preacher, Reverend Ashberry. He has
          haunted, maniacally repressed eyes and the ragged look of a habitual
          drunk.

          

          154. INT. POLICE STATION CELL DAY


          
          Boone is thrown into the cell. Eigerman and the three cops,
          Labowitz, Sergeant Pettine and Gibbs, all practised hard guys, enter
          the cell after him.

          
          EIGERMAN: Fuckin' freak! Fuckin' cannibal! [to his men] Stand him up!

          
          They haul Boone to his feet. Eigerman hits Boone with a wicked
          blackjack.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: You picked the wrong town, boy. We believe in real
          justice here, [a blow is delivered] They're gonna take you back to
          the city...[another blow]...but we're gonna leave you
          with something...[another blow]...to remember...[another]...us...by!

          
          Boone sags to the ground, unconscious.

          

          154A. INT. ASHBERRY'S CELL DAY


          
          As the sound of Boone being beaten up filters through the wall,
          Ashberry sits in his cell, Bible in hand. He flicks the pages over,
          attempting to distance himself from the violence he hears with study.
          He halts at a page with an illustration. It is something from
          Revelations: monsters and demons doing battle with angels. He puts
          the book down, and turns over his palm. It is a mass of tiny scars.
          He closes his hand into a white-knuckled fist, retreating into the
          shadows in the corner of his cell.

          
          We cutback to his hand. Blood seeps between the fingers, as his
          nails dig into the meat of his palm.

          

          155. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Eigerman enters. Decker is standing looking at Eigerman's collection
          of photographs.

          
          EIGERMAN: You still here?

          
          DECKER: I'm going back to Midian with you.

          
          EIGERMAN: I'm not going anywhere. We got press folks and
          photographers coming in from all over. Wouldn't be polite to keep 'em
          waiting.

          
          Eigerman starts to exit again. Joyce is in the doorway.

          
          EIGERMAN: Tell him. We got our man under lock and key.

          
          DECKER: Don't trust him. He...he...changes. I've seen him.

          
          EIGERMAN: I'll keep an eye out.

          
          JOYCE: He was right about the motel.

          
          EIGERMAN: So?

          
          JOYCE: So maybe there are more of them...

          
          EIGERMAN: Monsters?

          
          JOYCE: Killers. A cult. I don't know.

          
          EIGERMAN: You want to take some of the boys, take 'em Pettine?

          
          PETTINE: Yes, Sir -

          
          EIGERMAN: You, Tommy and Gibbs, take the Inspector out to the
          cemetery. Dig around. If you find anything with more two eyes,
          holler. I got photographers wanting me...

          
          He exits.

          

          156. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          Badly beaten, Boone lies in the corner, stirring when he hears the
          door unlocked. Labowitz ushers in a middle-aged, small-town
          physician, Doctor Rose.

          
          LABOWITZ: Doctor's here to examine you, freak. Just so nobody can
          say we laid a finger on you...[he winks at Rose] Looks okay to me,
          what do you think, Doc?

          
          Boone painfully pulls himself upright. Looks up at Dr Rose, who
          slips on his stethoscope, listens to Boone's chest. He moves it,
          listens, moves it again, alarmed. He takes Boone's wrist, feels
          around. Boone stares at him. Dr Rose clears his throat, rises, moves
          to Labowitz at the door and speaks quietly.

          
          DR ROSE: No pulse.

          
          LABOWITZ: What's that?

          
          DR ROSE: No...pulse.

          

          157. EXT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          A crowd of journalists and on-lookers mill outside the station. We
          find Lori, following her through the crowd as she tries to get a view
          of the building.

          
          As she watches, Joyce and his three-cop escort climb into two police
          cars and drive off.

          

          158. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          An impromptu press conference, with Eigerman centre stage, standing
          at a table laced with tape recorders and microphones.
          Behind him, a map of the town, with coloured pins and a blackboard
          drawing of the Sweetgrass Inn, including a diagram of where the
          bodies were found. Eigerman adores the attention.

          
          EIGERMAN: Yes he may have had accomplices but I can't reveal the
          precise source of my information on that...

          
          1ST REPORTER: Local source, Captain?

          
          EIGERMAN [a glance at Decker in the crowd]: Not so's you'd notice.

          
          2ND REPORTER: Has Boone made a confession?

          
          EIGERMAN: We found him with a piece of human flesh in his mouth.
          How's that for guilty?

          
          Cameras flash furiously. We see Labowitz leading Dr Rose through the
          crowd to the podium. Labowitz reaches Eigerman and whispers in his
          ear. Eigerman makes him repeat it. His brow knits in puzzlement. He
          turns to the press and smiles.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: 'Scuse me, folks, won't be a second.

          
          Eigerman points a beckoning finger at Decker, who follows him into
          his office, along with Labowitz and Dr Rose.

          

          159. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Eigerman closes the door and turns to Decker.

          
          EIGERMAN: Just exactly how many bullets did they put into this geek
          up at Midian?

          
          DECKER: Why?

          
          DR ROSE [severely shaken]: Half of them are still in him. In fact,
          he's riddled with them.

          
          DECKER: As I told you, these aren't ordinary people. You're saying
          he should be dead?

          
          DR ROSE: No, I'm saying he is dead.

          
          DECKER: When?

          
          EIGERMAN: Not lying down dead, friend. Walkin' around in my fucking
          cell dead. Now what about that?

          
          Decker's shaken. He grips his briefcase tightly.

          

          160. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          Boone sits in his cell, head down, expression masked, eyes moving
          restlessly.

          

          160A. INT. ASHBERRY'S CELL DAY


          
          Ashberry is sitting half in shadow and half in light. His eyes carry
          the half-buried mania that we'll see erupt later on. He puts his head
          against the wall and speaks softly to Boone, his tone intensifying as
          his feelings take stronger hold.

          
          ASHBERRY: Can you hear me? They'll find a way to kill you, you know
          that? Can't fight the darkness. Not when it's inside
          you. Are you listening? You're an abomination, Boone. You have to
          die. There's lots of ways. I've read about them. Seen them when I
          sleep. Horrible. HEAR ME?

          
          He suddenly slams his bloody hand against the wall.

          
          ASHBERRY: Have you got a God, Boone? Any God'll do. I had one,
          but...he doesn't listen any more. I ask him to take the
          dreams away but they keep coming. Blood and fire. Like the end of
          the world...

          
          We move from Ashberry's stricken face to the bloody mark his hand
          left in the wall. It vaguely resembles something we recognize:
          Baphomet's head.

          

          FADE OUT:

          

          FADE IN:

          

          161. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori emerges from a supermarket with food to eat. She walks into a
          small square, finds a seat and sits down to eat. As she reaches into
          the bag:

          
          BABETTE[V.O.]:Lori?

          
          She looks round. The voice sounded real. No sign of Babette.

          
          BABETTE [V.O. - cont.]: Lori...close your eyes.

          
          LORI [frightened]: Where are you?

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Please, do as I say.

          
          Lori closes her eyes.

          

          162. INT. SKULL CHAMBER CENTRE CORE


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - darkness.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Be with me...be with me...

          
          Dim light. We're in the Midian skull chamber, seeing it through
          Babette's eyes. Their voices merge into one.

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: ...where am I? What's happening to me?

          
          Rachel steps into view, and looks directly down at the camera.

          
          RACHEL: What is it, child?

          

          163. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori's eyes spring open. She's terrified.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Lori! Comeback!

          
          Lori closes her eyes again and we click back into...

          

          164. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - we see Babette's view of Rachel.

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: Is this real?

          
          RACHEL [whispers]: What are you talking about? Babette? [grips
          Babette] What have you done?

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: I've brought her, to see. She's in me. Babette
          breaks away, Rachel tries to catch hold, Babette runs.
          P.O.V. camera veers around and down through the maze of Midian.

          

          165. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Eyes closed on the bench, Lori gasps as the journey snatches her up.

          

          166. INT. CENTRAL CORE


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Babette races over a rope-bridge. We see
          it all through her eyes, her hands coming occasionally into view. We
          head down a narrow tunnel and into a small chamber, which is
          Babette's hidehole. We scan the treasures she keeps there: a doll
          made of grasses; birds' skulls; pretty stones. We hear voices from
          above and we look up at a steel grille, facing out on the surface.

          

          166A. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Pushing closer to the grille we see...Joyce, Pettine, Tommy and
          Gibbs, wandering through the Necropolis, armed to the hilt. Only
          Joyce carries no weapon.

          
          PETTINE: Christ, you could hide a fuckin' army in here.

          
          TOMMY: What egg-zactly are we lookin' for, Sarge?

          
          TOMMY [spits some tobacco juice on a tomb]: We're here to kick some
          major-league butt.

          
          JOYCE [distrusts these throwbacks]: We're here to scout, not engage

          
          TOMMY: Well what if they engage us? What about that?

          
          PETTINE: There's people down there, I can feel it.

          
          Lori/Babette gasps, Pettine hears the sound and walks over to the
          grille.

          

          
          TOMMY: Why don't we just shoot 'em in their graves? Save us
          diggin' new ones, [giggles - fires at one of the tombs]

          
          JOYCE [angry]: Hold your fire!

          
          PETTINE: We want prisoners, Tommy.

          
          Pettine goes down on his haunches beside the grille, runs the muzzle
          of his gun along it. P.O.V. camera withdraws into the
          shadows. He shakes his head and...

          

          167. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          We cut out of the P.O.V. as Pettine stands.

          
          PETTINE: There's something down there all right.

          
          JOYCE: If that's the case we'll call for back-up...

          
          Pettine spots a movement in the shadows of a half-open mausoleum
          door. He catches Gibbs' eye, nods in the direction of the door, Gibbs
          gets the idea and starts to back towards the tomb.

          
          PETTINE [a performance]: I don't know. Maybe we're just spooked.
          Hell, who'd live in a graveyard, anyway? [crossing towards Gibbs]
          What do you say, Lieutenant? Maybe we oughta just pack it in...head
          for home...

          
          He and Gibbs rush the door of the tomb; there's a cry of surprise
          from inside.

          

          168. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Camera glides back up to the grille in
          time to see Gibbs and Pettine drag Ohnaka out of darkness and into
          the sunlight where he lacks the strength to resist.

          
          TOMMY: Well, lookee what we got here...

          
          Tommy strikes Ohnaka with a rifle butt, knocking him to his knees.

          

          169. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          As the cops circle around Ohnaka, he moans, puts his head down and
          covers his face with his hands.

          
          GIBBS: Shit. Don't look so tough to me.

          
          PETTINE: Want we should interrogate it, Lieutenant?

          
          JOYCE [amazed]: Give it some room.

          
          In the sunlight, Ohnaka's naked back begins to smoke and blister.

          
          GIBBS: What the hell for?

          
          JOYCE: God damn it! There's something wrong with him...

          
          TOMMY [disgusted]: Shit...

          
          PETTINE: What the fuck is this?

          
          Gibbs, unfazed, steps up to Ohnaka and kicks the creature over.

          
          GIBBS: We want answers, asshole!

          
          JOYCE: Back off, Gibbs!

          
          Gibbs ignores him, trying to drag Ohnaka's hands away from his face.

          

          170. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Watching the knot of men around the
          defenceless Ohnaka.

          
          LORI/BABETTE [V.O.]: The light...

          

          171. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Gibbs rifle-butts Ohnaka's hands, then pulls them away from his
          face; the features are horribly disfigured, blood running from his
          eyes, scorched by the sun. Now even Gibbs tries to back away, but
          Ohnaka grabs hold of his shirt.

          
          GIBBS: Shit! Shit! Get it off me! Tommy!

          
          TOMMY: No way, man!

          
          Pettine fires his piece at Ohnaka, hitting him in the belly and arm,
          but he still holds on, throwing back his head and howling. Smoke
          rises from his entire body, dust pours from his veins. The howl
          becomes a high-pitched whine and he explodes, in a burst of dust and
          black blood.

          

          172. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - They see Ohnaka die.

          

          173. EXT. SHERE NECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori opens her eyes, which are running with tears.

          
          LORI: Oh my God...oh my God...

          
          She stands up, her hand to her mouth.

          

          174. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          Lori and Babette's P.O.V. - Babette's trembling hands hold onto the
          grille as she watches.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: Lori, don't leave, please don't leave me.

          

          175. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          The cops stare in disbelief at Ohnaka's dusty remains.

          
          PETTINE: Jesus...d'you see that fucker's face?

          
          JOYCE: It was the sun. The sun did it.

          
          GIBBS: Christ on a crutch...

          
          JOYCE: Man, that tears it, I'm calling the fuckin' chief.

          
          Gibbs raises a trembling match to his cigarette as Tommy heads back
          to the cars.

          
          GIBBS: Couldn't have been just...just the sun...

          
          JOYCE: Believe it, shithead.

          
          PETTINE [grinning]: So if all it takes is the sun, we got the
          perfect weapon, right over our heads.

          
          JOYCE: Until it goes down.

          
          Pettine's smile fades. Then a cry of alarm from the distance.

          
          TOMMY [V.O.]: Oh no! Shit! Pettine! Goddamn it!

          
          The men rush to the gate.

          

          176. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY


          
          The two police cars are on fire. The other cops reach them, Pettine
          reaches into the one less involved in flame and pulls out the radio
          microphone.

          
          JOYCE: Who did it, did you see anyone? 

          
          Tommy shakes his head. They all look up, hearing a distant car engine.

          

          177. EXT./INT. BEAT-UP CAR DAY


          
          Wearing a hat and dark glasses, laughing, Narcisse drives this old
          clunker like a maniac, takes a large cigar out of his mouth.

          
          He strikes a match off a thumb hook and lights up. In the back,
          protected from sunlight by shades on the windows, is Rachel.

          

          178. INT. POLICE STATION TOILET DAY


          
          The door opens, a panicked Labowitz enters.

          
          LABOWITZ: Chief, come quick...

          
          EIGERMAN [from inside a stall]: This better be good...

          
          LABOWITZ: Pettine's on the radio, they're under attack.

          
          EIGERMAN: Hot damn, we got contact!

          
          He bursts out of the stall, hitching his trousers.

          

          179. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Eigerman enters, takes the two-way receiver. Behind him, Decker,
          Labowitz and Kane enter the office.

          
          EIGERMAN: Pettine, what's your situation.

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          180. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          

           INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Pettine on the radio, as the others try to keep back the flames.

          
          PETTINE [into radio]: The place is crawling with 'em...they torched
          our cars...fuckin' freaks!...

          
          The transmission breaks up. Eigerman turns to the others in the room.

          
          EIGERMAN [joyfully]: ...Sound the call, boys, let the bells of
          freedom ring, we got to mobilize.

          
          Decker affectionately runs his hand over his briefcase.

          

          181. EXT. SHERENECK STREET DAY


          
          Lori moves down the street, blinking through tears.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: I'm afraid ...

          
          LORI: I have to go, Babette, I have to get help. I'll be back, I
          promise. You hide somewhere.

          
          The connection fades. Lori wipes the tears from her cheeks.

          

          182. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          The crowd and journalists still hanging around; Eigerman throws the
          door open.

          
          EIGERMAN: Listen up! We got officers under attack, I need volunteers
          for a posse! Y'all sign up with Officer Labowitz here!

          
          He moves back towards the office, as Labowitz, clipboard in hand, is
          besieged with offers.

          

          183. INT. EIGERMAN'S OFFICE DAY


          
          Decker is sitting with his briefcase open on his lap, gazing

          AFFECTIONATELY 
          at the button head mask inside. He snaps the case shut as Eigerman 
          re-enters, followed by the silent Kane. Eigerman digs a key
          out of his desk.

          
          EIGERMAN: If you're gonna make an omelette you have to break eggs,
          isn't that right, Professor?

          
          DECKER [doesn't follow]: Sorry?

          
          EIGERMAN: Christmas comes early this year.

          

          184. INT. POLICE STATION STORAGE ROOM DAY


          

          
          Eigerman leads Decker, Kane and another cop down into the bowels of
          the station. He unlocks a door and switches on a light. Warehoused
          inside is a virtual arsenal in a number of packing crates stencilled
          with a martial insignia and the name:

          SONS OF THE FREE: SHERE NECK BRIGADE'

          
          The crates are also stamped with their countries of origin: South
          Africa and the Soviet Union.

          
          EIGERMAN: Ounce a' prevention is worth a pound a' cure. Save for a
          rainy day, one day that day will come. Don't matter if it's Commies,
          homos, freaks or Japs, we are ready. World class ordnance, Doc: the
          best private sector money can buy.

          
          Kane, with a clipboard, goes over supplies with the other cop.

          
          KANE [over above  in his element): Okay. We got your spankin' new
          G3 thirty-odd-six Springfield semi-auto with roller-lock
          action and retractable stock. For standard carbine firepower, you
          can't beat this match-accurate Galil AR 7.62 NATO assault rifle and
          for the sportsman in the crowd we carry this handy, double-pump,
          Mossberg Persuader, sling swivels double extractors, which also comes
          in a light-weight single-barrel size for ladies and juniors -

          
          DECKER: Marvelous, really, but -

          
          KANE: Now over here we're talkin' Damascus, high-carbon Spetnatz
          shootin' knives, and for that tough up-close-and-
          personal work, you can always count on your razor-wire/fishing-line
          garotte when nuthin' else will do 

          
          DECKER [over Kane]: Captain, have you considered the possibility
          that knives and bullets won't be adequate to the task?

          
          EIGERMAN: Show him, Kane.

          
          KANE [pulling off a shroud to unveil]: That's why we bought these
          cherry Israeli Army high-octane linear-field flame throwers.

          
          EIGERMAN: Now I know what you're thinkin', Doc; maybe there's some
          sort'a spiritual angle to all this. Well, we got that
          covered, too.

          

          185. INT. POLICE STATION CELLS NIGHT


          
          A cell door swings open. Decker and Eigerman look in on the Baptist
          preacher, Reverend Ashberry.

          
          EIGERMAN: Reverend Ashberry, your services are required.

          
          DECKER: He looks like a drunk.

          
          EIGERMAN: He is; lost his way, poor bastard, [hauling Ashberry to
          his feet] You wouldn't wanna miss the Day of Judgment, now would you?

          
          ASHBERRY [seems he's been waiting for this]: The Apocalypse? It's
          here?

          
          EIGERMAN: They're warming up for it over in Midian. [leading him
          out] Padre, you get your pious butt over to church and load up on
          some Holy Water and crucifixes...we're goin' in there with God on our
          side.

          186. EXT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          Boone looks out the window of his cell as a large, unruly posse
          musters outside in a variety of vehicles. A mix of survivalist
          fanatics in Sons of the Free-labelled camouflage, Marlboro Men with
          six-shooters, red-neck bozos with their diesel-dyke mamas and heavily
          made-up bimbos out for a good time. The atmosphere is one of near
          carnival.

          
          Accoutred for combat, Kane and some other cops distribute the weapons.

          
          Boone slumps away from the window, his worst fears realized.

          
          Reverend Ashberry arrives, lugging six full canteens and an arm-load
          of crucifixes. He loads into the back of an enclosed, high-tech
          camper with Eigerman and Decker. Eigerman blows an air-horn, claiming
          the crowd's attention.

          
          EIGERMAN: You are all hereby deputized in the name of the law. Now
          let's kick some ass!

          
          Eigerman's truck leads the caravan, which drives off, horns honking,
          war whoops and liquor-fuelled courage. As the dust clears now, left
          more or less alone, Lori looks at the police station.

          
          A beat-up car squeals to a halt in front of her and the front door
          opens.

          
          NARCISSE: Hey, chickie, want a ride?

          
          LORI: No...

          
          RACHEL: Please.

          
          Lori sees Rachel and gets in the car.

          

          187. INT. BEAT-UP CAR DAY


          
          Narcisse drives around the block, smoking his cigar.

          
          NARCISSE: We have to get Boone out, Midian needs him...

          
          LORI: What could he do?

          
          RACHEL: He went into Baphomet's chamber. He spoke with the Baptiser...

          
          NARCISSE: And survived; nobody ever did that before.

          
          RACHEL: Perhaps Baphomet told him something, something that could
          save Midian.

          
          NARCISSE: Where they keeping him?

          
          LORI: Inside somewhere. He'll be guarded.

          
          RACHEL: He has powers of his own.

          
          LORI: Tell me about it; what's happened to him?

          
          NARCISSE: He was bitten by a Nightbreed, see, the taint's in his
          system...

          
          RACHEL: Boone has been turned, he's one of us...

          
          LORI: Okay. So what you're saying is, you're saying he's dead.

          
          NARCISSE: Hey, some of my best friends are dead.

          
          LORI [horrified]: ...I'm going out of my mind.

          
          NARCISSE [to Rachel]: See? I told you she'd take it well.

          

          188. EXT. HIGHWAY DAY


          
          The posse heads down the road, whoops and hollers emerging from the
          dust cloud it kicks up.

          

          189. INT. CAB OF EIGERMAN'S TRUCK DAY


          
          Eigerman cleans his silver-plate Magnum .45, Decker sits beside him
          holding his briefcase, across from Ashberry, who's frantically paging
          through an ancient Bible.

          
          EIGERMAN: Ever performed an exorcism, Father?

          
          ASHBERRY: No.

          
          EIGERMAN: Ever seen one?

          
          ASHBERRY: No.

          
          EIGERMAN: Well I'd start rehearsin' if I was you. [hands a gun
          towards Decker] Why don't you hang on to that, Doc?

          
          DECKER [a little prim]: Oh no, I wouldn't know how to use it...

          
          ASHBERRY [finds something in the book, reads]: Listen! 'So Moses
          spoke to the people, saying "Arm yourselves for war and let them go
          and take vengeance for the Lord on Midian..." and so they burned with
          fire all the cities where they dwelt and
          killed the kings of Midian, both man and beast!'

          
          EIGERMAN [with a wink]: Hey, how 'bout that, Doc? Sounds like we're
          on a crusade against the Devil himself.

          
          ASHBERRY [not terribly convincing]: I don't believe in the Devil.

          
          DECKER: Oh...you will.

          
          Ashberry looks at Decker; no trace of irony in his expression.
          Ashberry sorts through the canteens, finds the one that doesn't have
          a white cross on it, opens it and knocks back two fingers of bourbon.

          190. EXT. SHERE NECK POLICE STATION DAY


          
          The sun sinking low in the sky. The shadows are long.

          

          191. INT. POLICE STATION CELL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          The station is eerily quiet. Labowitz and an Irish cop, Connie
          Cormack, guard the cells. Two other cops patrol the end of the
          corridor. All heavily armed. Labowitz moves to the door of Boone's
          cell.

          

          192. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          The spy-hole cover is open. Boone looks up.

          
          LABOWITZ [from other side of door]: Hey, freak-face, we found your
          pals. They're gonna fry, just like you. Give us a smile now.

          
          Boone stares at the floor, depressed, defeated.

          

          193. INT. CELL CORRIDOR/OFFICE DAY


          
          Labowitz chuckles and closes the spy-hole. He walks back down to the
          coffee station near Eigerman's office, where Cormack is pouring two
          cups. He takes out a flask, spikes his mug and offers some to
          Labowitz.

          
          CORMACK: Little Irish in your joe, Constable Labowitz?

          
          LABOWITZ [a bad brogue]: Don't mind if I do, Constable Cormack. 

          
          There is a knock on the station door. They look at each other.
          Cormack picks up his gun and crosses to the door.

          
          CORMACK: Who's there?

          
          RACHEL [O.S.]: Help me, please.

          
          CORMACK: What's wrong?

          
          RACHEL [O.S.]: Accident. We need help.

          
          Cormack decides to unbolt the door. On the step stands Rachel,
          shrouded in black veils. Only her eyes are visible. They fix
          Cormack.

          
          CORMACK: What's the problem, lady?

          
          She drops the veil. The other half of her face has disappeared into
          smoke.

          
          CORMACK [cont.]: What the blazes?

          
          Her costume falls to the ground. Her eyes dissolve. As smoke, Rachel
          blows into the station. Cormack fires through the smoke, yelling as
          he does so.

          
          LABOWITZ [running towards the cell]: Hold 'em, Connie!

          

          194. INT. CELL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          The two other cops hear the shot and run towards the station.
          Labowitz runs back in with them before they get there, slams and
          bolts the door.

          
          LABOWITZ [to the other cops]: Hold your ground! [yells through the
          door] Cormack? You all right?

          

          195. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          Cormack turns back towards the door, sees Narcisse, screams and
          fires twice. Narcisse flips one of the bullets out of his chest with
          a thumb-nail, then leaps onto Cormack, who manages to shoot himself
          in the foot. Lori enters, slams the door and locks it. Narcisse
          squats over Cormack, holds his razor-nails under his chin.

          
          NARCISSE: Where is he? Where's Boone?

          
          CORMACK: Cell f-f-f-five...through the door...

          
          NARCISSE [grins at Lori]: I love a coward.

          

          196. INT. CELL CORRIDOR DOOR DAY


          
          Labowitz and the other cops confidently prepare for a siege.

          
          LABOWITZ [calling back to Boone]: Don't think you're getting sprung,
          freak. No way they get through that door; solid steel,
          armour-piercing shells wouldn't even make a dent...

          
          Smoke seeps through the key-hole, and from beneath the connecting
          door.

          
          LABOWITZ [cont.]: You hear me, freak? No fuckin' way!

          
          The smoke from the key-hole begins to form into a face, which floats
          on a cord of smoke/flesh from the key-hole. The smoke from beneath
          the door forms into breasts and rib cage, in which a heart beats.
          Labowitz turns and sees it.

          
          LABOWITZ [cont.]: Jesus Christ...

          
          He empties his gun through the smoke; the two cops on the other side
          of the smoke are hit and go down.

          
          An arm moves towards Labowitz; so does Rachel's face. Her beauty
          mesmerizes him. Her naked breasts, which float beneath
          the head, barely connected to it as yet, enchant him even more.

          
          RACHEL: Come closer...I don't want to kill you...

          
          Her hand presses Labowitz's rifle aside. Rachel's lips touch him. He
          doesn't resist, but once his mouth is sealed against hers he can't
          breathe. He tries to raise the rifle, but she dashes it from his
          hand. Then she snatches the keys from his belt and breaks the kiss.
          He falls to his knees, gasping. Her body completed and naked, Rachel
          unlocks the connecting door, then starts looking for Boone. Behind
          her, as Labowitz reaches for his gun, Narcisse's hand reaches in and
          grabs his throat.

          
          NARCISSE: Naughty, naughty.

          
          Labowitz looks up into Narcisse's scarred face and faints. Lori
          steps past Labowitz to the cell Rachel directs her towards.

          
          RACHEL: We don't have much time.

          
          LORI: I know.

          
          Lori unlocks the door.

          

          197. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          LORI [nervous]: Boone?

          
          BOONE [wakes]: Stay away from me. I'll hurt you.

          
          LORI: I don't think so.

          
          BOONE: You know what I did in that room? I'm a goddamn cannibal.
          Stay away!

          
          LORI: They're going to come for you.

          
          BOONE: Let them. Let them find some way to kill me.

          
          LORI: You can't die. Midian needs you.

          
          BOONE: Midian's just a hole in the ground. It's full of things that
          should lie down and stay dead.

          
          LORI: All right. If not for the Breed, then for me. You can't give
          up on us.

          
          BOONE: You talk like you're one of them.

          
          LORI: Maybe I wish I was. Some little part of me. [she puts her hand
          on his face] All I know is, I'm not afraid of you. I know I should
          be, but I'm not. I still want you, whatever you are. And I'm not
          going to leave you. If they come for you, then they'll have to kill
          me too.

          
          BOONE: No!

          
          LORI: So fight. For both of us. For all of us. I don't want to be
          dust. I want us flesh and blood. Kiss me. I love you.

          
          He kisses her. First tentatively, then with great passion.

          

          198. INT. CELL CORRIDOR DAY


          
          Narcisse knocks, calls through the door.

          
          NARCISSE: What the hell are you doing in there?

          

          INTERCUT:

          

          199. INT. BOONE'S CELL DAY


          
          Fucking, is the answer. They are wound around each other: licking,
          biting, gasping. Boone thrusts up into her.

          
          LORI: Yes...yes!

          
          NARCISSE [to himself]: Jesus. Bastard does better dead than I did
          alive.

          

          200. INT. POLICE STATION DAY


          
          The connecting door flies open, a rejuvenated Boone and Lori move
          into the office where Narcisse and Rachel are waiting. Narcisse toys
          with the unconscious Cormack.

          
          RACHEL: Are we going?

          
          NARCISSE: About time.

          
          BOONE: Midian.

          
          NARCISSE: All right.

          
          BOONE: It's about time they saw the truth.

          

          201. SCENE DELETED

          

          202. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES LATE AFTERNOON


          
          Gibbs, Joyce, Tommy and Pettine wait outside the gates. Pettine
          paces. Joyce looks at his watch, moves over to Pettine and speaks
          quietly.

          
          JOYCE: How long until dark?

          
          PETTINE: Two hours. Two and a half. I told 'em to bring gasoline.
          We'll burn the bastards out.

          
          JOYCE: Has it occurred to you maybe we've got this all wrong? We
          could be destroying...I don't know, a whole new species.

          
          PETTINE: You saw that fucker below, Lieutenant, same as me. That
          damn thing was just too weird to live.

          
          JOYCE: Maybe they're just different.

          
          PETTINE: Isn't that enough reason?

          
          Joyce stares at him. In background, Tommy starts to holler. Pettine
          calls.

          
          PETTINE [cont.]: What is it?

          
          Tommy is pointing frantically at a dust cloud in the distance.

          

          203. EXT. ROAD TO MIDIAN LATE AFTERNOON


          
          A violent cut to the roar of engines as we track with the fast-
          moving posse. Eigerman stands up out of a skylight in the cab of his
          truck, eggs on the other vehicles with a rebel war cry.

          
          EIGERMAN: Yee-hah!

          

          204. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES LATE AFTERNOON


          
          As the caravan appears. Ecstasy. Tommy and Gibbs dance a jig together.

          
          GIBBS: It's the fuckin' cavalry!

          
          The posse speeds down towards the Necropolis gates.

          

          205. EXT. ROAD TO MIDIAN


          

           INT. CAR DUSK


          
          Narcisse's beat-up car speeds down the highway towards Midian.

          
          BOONE: How much further?

          
          NARCISSE: A mile, maybe two...

          
          We close in on Rachel, who stares ahead of her, as if in a trance.

          
          RACHEL: We're too late.

          
          NARCISSE: Hang on!

          
          Steering hard, he veers the car off the road and into thick woods.
          Branches thrash against the windshield.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.]: This is a shortcut!

          

          206. EXT. NECROPOLIS DUSK


          
          The posse is busily at work around the Necropolis, Eigerman and Kane
          supervising. Some are laying trails of gasoline through the pathways.
          Others are simply patrolling, guns in hand. There is an air of
          nervous anticipation.

          
          Ashberry comes round a tomb and we follow him down a walkway,
          staring in awe at the mausoleums and statuary.

          
          Looking at a particularly large tomb, Ashberry's eye is captivated
          by a large, fantastically rendered marble winged angel. He approaches
          it, reaches up to touch it. The angel, a monster, turns to look at
          him with sad, impassive gravity. Then we see its shadow on Ashberry's
          face and hear the slow, thick beating of its wings as it flies off.

          
          Ashberry's stunned. He fumbles the top of his bourbon canteen off,
          takes a long drink, then stops when he sees a load of dynamite taped
          to the side of the tomb. He follows the wire that leads off it to
          another dynamite pack on an adjacent tomb and then another. He's
          panicked.

          

          207. EXT. NECROPOLIS DUSK


          
          Kane is escorting Eigerman and Pettine down a pathway, pointing out
          the posse's handiwork.

          
          KANE: ...packets of plastique at every intersection, trip wires
          outside the biggest tombs, we figure those'll be the major escape
          routes...

          
          EIGERMAN: How much longer?

          
          KANE: Five minutes.

          
          EIGERMAN [into walkie-talkie]: Let's pull back to the perimeter
          before we lose the light. We've got movement underground;
          they're hearing it round the walls.

          
          ASHBERRY [approaching them from the side]: Captain!

          
          KANE: Jesus, not there, STOP. [Ashberry freezes] We got Claymores
          planted in the rosebushes, Reverend, cut your nuts off 
          faster'n a hedge clipper.

          
          ASHBERRY: We've made a mistake, there are Angels here, a heavenly
          host...

          
          EIGERMAN: You're drunk, asshole.

          
          Ashberry dumps the bourbon out of his canteen.

          
          ASHBERRY: No. Listen to me, it's wrong, it's sacrilege, this is holy
          ground...

          
          EIGERMAN: Get the hell up that hill, you pinhead.

          
          ASHBERRY: You brought me here because I'm a man of God.

          
          EIGERMAN: That's right; hang round here a couple more minutes,
          Padre, and you'll be sitting at his left hand. Now get your sorry ass
          out of the fuckin' way...

          
          Eigerman backhands him. Ashberry falls. Eigerman, Kane, Pettine and
          the other cops begin to pull back.

          
          Ashberry looks up, as he hears grindings and growls in the earth.
          Boone is lifting off the top of a nearby tomb. Ashberry is about to
          shoot when Narcisse grabs him around the throat, puts a finger to his
          lips and signals him to be quiet. Narcisse follows Boone into the
          tomb. The tomb-lid scrapes as it's pushed back into place from
          beneath. Ashberry starts to pray.

          

          207A. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          Boone and Narcisse move through the panicking underground, creatures
          fleeing in every direction. Boone sees Lylesburg, trying to keep the
          panic down, moves towards him.

          
          LYLESBURG: Stay down! Stay where you are, they're waiting for us
          above...

          
          BOONE [intercepting him]: No! if you stay here you'll be
          slaughtered...

          
          LYLESBURG: This is our home.

          
          BOONE: Not anymore...

          
          LYLESBURG: We belong here...

          
          BOONE: Listen to me, old man, the rules change; if you want to live
          it won't be here and it won't be by your laws...

          
          Other creatures have stopped, watching the confrontation. Boone
          speaks to them as well.

          
          BOONE [cont.]: If you'want to survive we've got to fight back, we
          can't hide anymore! [to Lylesburg] What's it gonna be?

          
          Lylesburg slumps, acquiescing, unable to refuse Boone's assertions.

          
          BOONE [cont.] [to Narcisse]: Get the children above ground, find a
          hiding place...[to the others] Get ready to fight! [to Lylesburg]
          What about Baphomet? Can he be moved?

          
          LYLESBURG: Yes. It could be done.

          
          BOONE: It must be done. Brothers and sisters, it's time to fight!

          

          207A. INT. CHAMBERS


          
          Leroy and Lude listen to Boone on the bridge.

          
          LEROY: You hear what he said?

          
          LUDE: What chance have we got? They're armed.

          
          LEROY [opens jacket]: So am I.

          
          Two one-eyed snakes, nesting in Leroy's belly, slide up from his
          innards and wrap around his neck.

          
          LEROY: They call us monsters, remember? They're afraid of us. Let's
          give 'em reason.

          
          LUDE: It's a long time since I spilled blood.

          
          LEROY: You never lose the knack.

          

          208. EXT. HILL ABOVE THE NECROPOLIS DUSK


          
          From this high vantage point, Decker watches the preparations below
          through binoculars, with the glee of a pyromaniac at a fire-storm.
          The sun is setting. He stares up at it, squinting into its brightness.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: ...I'm waiting...Philip?...

          
          Decker looks towards the patrol car parked nearby. The front door is
          open. On the passenger seat sits his briefcase. Decker quickly
          crosses to the car.

          
          DECKER: Be quiet.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Let me out, Philip. There's going to be bloodshed.
          I want to see.

          
          Decker opens the briefcase. The mask and his knives are laid out
          inside.

          
          THE MASK: Ah, that's better.

          
          DECKER: We can't let anyone see us...

          
          THE MASK: I want to be free!

          
          JOYCE [V.O.]: Decker?

          
          Decker swings round, slamming the case shut, as Joyce approaches.

          
          DECKER: Lieutenant...[covering flawlessly] You gave me such a start.

          
          JOYCE: Eigerman's invited you to watch from the command post.

          
          DECKER: Oh, I don't think I'm up to it, really.

          
          JOYCE: ...I've got a bad feeling about this.

          
          DECKER: Believe me, Lieutenant, whoever or whatever's living down
          there deserves what's coming.

          
          JOYCE: Monsters, you mean?

          
          DECKER: Unnatural, misbegotten creatures.

          
          JOYCE: I don't know. The only monsters I've ever seen had a human
          face.

          
          As Joyce looks down at the Necropolis, Decker sneaks an anxious side-
          long glance at his briefcase.

          The final explosives-layers exit, their backs covered by
          flamethrower and machine-gun-carrying mob members. A distraught
          Ashberry is the last out.

          
          Midian is now completely deserted. Dandelion seeds drift down the
          walkways, caught in shafts of sunlight.

          

          210. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES/COMMAND POST DUSK


          
          Eigerman, Pettine and Kane, looking at their watches.

          
          KANE [a pause  then]: ...T-minus fifteen seconds...ten, nine,eight,
          seven, six, five, four, three, two, one ...

          
          EIGERMAN: Go.

          
          Kane depresses the detonator. There are two large explosions,
          followed by several smaller ones. Part of the Necropolis wall is
          blasted out. Several members of the posse retreat. Eigerman pulls his
          pistol.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: You there, stand your ground! [fires a warning
          shot] Stand your ground, damn you!

          
          The defectors stop. Several more chain explosions in Necropolis.

          Narcisse is leading a group of child monsters, as the explosions
          bring earth plunging down from the ceiling. Babies cry. Monsters
          scream. We see several creatures howling in bestial terror.

          
          Babette is separated from Narcisse's group by falling earth, nearly
          trampled in the chaos. She is picked up by the dog-faced man.

          
          BABETTE: I want my mother.

          
          MAN: We'll find her.

          

          213A. INT. PELOQUIN'S CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          Peloquin squats on the step overlooking the fire-pit, listening to
          the sound of invasion from above. There is a mixture of fear and rage
          on his face. In the darkness opposite, Kinski.

          
          KINSKI: We began this.

          
          PELOQUIN: I just wanted meat. I didn't know he was going to cause
          this.

          
          KINSKI: There were prophesies. The seventh saviour.

          
          PELOQUIN: I didn't believe the prophesies and I didn't obey the Law.
          You want to see me bleed for it? All right, I'll bleed.

          
          He exits the chamber.

          

          214. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES/COMMAND POST NIGHT


          
          Smoke billows over the walls. Eigerman moves closer to the gates,
          listening to the wild cries from inside. He grabs Ashberry by the
          collar.

          
          EIGERMAN: That sound like a heavenly choir to you, Padre?

          
          ASHBERRY: I have to see!

          
          Ashberry shakes himself free and heads through the gates, into the
          Necropolis. Eigerman turns to the others, lights a cigar.

          
          EIGERMAN: Pettine!

          
          PETTINE: Chief?

          
          EIGERMAN: We're moving in.

          
          PETTINE [locks and loads his machine-gun]: Yes, sir! [turns -
          addresses the posse] We're movin' in!

          
          Car engines are revved, headlights turned on, piercing the smoke.

          

          215. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Ashberry wanders through the Necropolis as the Breed begin to emerge
          on every side.

          
          The air is full of sad, melodious sounds, like whale-song. Ghostly
          forms appear from the smoke and drift towards him.

          
          ASHBERRY [in awe]: Dear Lord...

          
          Some of the creatures brush him as they drift by: their strange
          beauty entrances him.

          
          ASHBERRY: Dear Lord ...Forgive me...

          
          There are images here which have the flavour of Christian
          iconography. Mother and child. A man bleeding from his brow. A
          creature with a halo of smoke. He wanders on.

          Decker watches impassively. Joyce moves towards the gate. As he
          reaches it an extraordinary creature appears.

          
          JOYCE: My God.

          
          It means no harm. Joyce steps aside and the creature moves off into
          the night.

          
          We cut back to Decker.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Don't deny me Philip...

          
          DECKER: Soon. I promise.

          
          Decker hears shouts to his flank, steps back, out of sight and sees
          Lori and Rachel emerge from a hiding place, Lori trying to restrain
          Rachel from going in.

          
          RACHEL: Babette!

          
          LORI: Rachel, no!

          
          Rachel breaks away and runs towards the Necropolis. Lori is alone.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Now, perfect, finish her. She's the only one who
          knows about us.

          
          DECKER: What about Boone?

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Boone's a monster. They all die tonight.

          
          DECKER [smiles]: All right.

          
          THE MASK [V.O.]: Quickly, Philip, we'll lose her.

          
          The briefcase is opened. The light of distant fires flicker on the
          mask.

          Boone and Narcisse lead the column of Breed, children and babies up
          from underground into the Necropolis itself.

          
          BOONE: Hurry up.

          
          NARCISSE: Is this wise? Coming above ground?

          
          BOONE: If we stay below they'll slaughter us.

          
          NARCISSE: This is their territory.

          
          BOONE: No. The night's ours. Now get the rest of the children up
          here, I'm going to find a clear way through!

          
          He heads away, leaving a frightened group of Breed and children.

          

          218B. EXT. GATES OF NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Peloquin appears overground, scanning the destruction before racing
          off.

          

          219. EXT. GATES OF NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Eigerman addresses the assembled posse.

          
          EIGERMAN: They're coming out, and they're armed, so watch
          yourselves. It's a fucking freak-show in there! We're not taking
          prisoners! It's us or them! Let's clean up!

          
          The engines rev, and the posse charges the gates. The lead vehicle,
          driven by a manic, grinning Kane, rams the gates, and crashes through.

          
          KANE: Us or them! Us or them!

          
          On the other side of the gates, Peloquin appears in Kane's headlights.

          
          KANE: Shit!

          
          Peloquin jumps up into the air as the car careers towards him.

          
          We see him somersault in the air. Kane hears him land on the car
          roof. We see Peloquin on the roof, bend over the windshield.

          
          His face appears in front of a panicking Kane, the mouth suddenly
          opening grotesquely wide.

          
          Kane slams the breaks on. Peloquin is thrown off.

          
          KANE: Eat dirt, fucker!

          
          Peloquin is thrown to the ground, his face caught in the blaze of
          headlights as Kane's vehicle revs and drives at him.

          
          KANE [ecstatic]: Yeah!

          
          His momentum carries the car towards the crater blown in the ground.
          Kane's pleasure turns to horror.

          
          KANE: Oh shit! Shit!

          
          He turns to swerve, but too late, the car heads over the edge.
          Wounded, Peloquin crawls off.

          

          219A. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          Dirt falls from the roof. Headlights appear.

          The car slides into the earth. The guns stacked behind him fall
          forward.

          
          KANE: Oh my Jesus!

          

          219C. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          Kane's car drops through the roof of Midian, falling through the
          core, breaking bridges as it falls. Breed are thrown off walkways to
          their deaths. The car strikes the top of Baphomet's chamber and a
          plume of fire, followed by several small explosions, marks Kane's
          death.

          

          219D. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          The explosions rock the chamber. Dirt falls. Baphomet looks towards
          the roof, with great sadness on his face.

          

          219E. INT. INITIATION CHAMBER


          
          Boone enters the initiation chamber. Lylesburg is standing beside
          the bowl of Baphomet's blood, which is bubbling furiously.

          
          BOONE: What the hell are you doing down here? We need help!

          
          LYLESBURG: This was intended.

          
          BOONE: Fuck that! We're not going to lie down and die.

          
          LYLESBURG: It's Baphomet's will. He's going to destroy the Naturals,
          and us. Everything, in one last fire.

          
          BOONE: How do you know?

          
          LYLESBURG: Look for yourself.

          
          He points to the bowl.

          
          BOONE: It's going to blow?

          
          LYLESBURG: Yes.

          
          BOONE: He'll destroy his own people?

          
          LYLESBURG: Better it ends quickly. We can't escape them. We remind
          them of the darkness in themselves. They hate that.

          
          BOONE: So did I. I learned better. We can make it out. But I need
          fighters.

          
          LYLESBURG: We're not warriors...

          
          BOONE: What about the Berserkers?

          
          LYLESBURG: They're uncontrollable.

          
          BOONE: All the better. Let them out. Don't just stand there!

          
          We're the tribes of the moon, remember?

          
          Doubt and fear mingle in Lylesburg's look, but he finally nods his
          head.

          
          LYLESBURG: I'll release the Berserkers.

          
          BOONE: Be quick. We haven't got forever. Yet.

          
          Lylesburg smiles. Boone leaves. The Drummer is at the door.

          
          BOONE: You come with me. The rest of you get out of here.

          
          He exits with the Drummer.

          

          219F. EXT. GATES NIGHT


          
          The posse enter in large numbers, firing to left and right. We see
          Breed shot down.

          

          219G. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone races to the entrance, to see Eigerman's posse moving towards
          the Necropolis. One of the posse has a flame thrower. He burns up the
          foliage. From Boone's P.O.V. we view the enemy: grinning sweating
          monsters. There's no way out in this direction.

          

          219H. EXT. GATES NIGHT


          
          Lori looks towards the conflagration.

          
          LORI: Oh Jesus, Boone.

          
          Behind her, we see a familiar, masked figure approaching: Decker.
          She doesn't hear him over the shouts and screams.

          

          219I. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          One of the posse fires a rocket into a giant Breed who explodes.
          Boone reacts with horror at the destruction. When he turns back he
          sees Breed watching too, defenceless.

          
          BOONE: Arm yourselves! Defend yourselves! You're not cattle, for
          Christ's sake. They don't have any right to kill you!

          
          He races back the way he came, and pulls coffins from the walls,
          tearing their lids off with supernatural strength. He breaks the wood
          into clubs. The Breed watch him.

          
          BOONE: Weapons! You need weapons or it's over!

          
          One or two understand, and do as he's doing.

          
          BOONE: All of you!

          
          They do as he orders.

          
          BOONE: Stop them getting in! They'll kill the children!

          

          219J. EXT. GATES NIGHT


          
          Lori turns to see Decker appearing from the darkness. He attacks
          her, cutting her arm. She backs away before he can strike a second
          time, retreating towards the gates. Then she turns and walks through
          the reeds; Decker on her heels.

          

          219K. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          The posse led by Pettine invade the entrances to the Necropolis,
          engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Breed.

          

          219L. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone races through the Necropolis, finding that other posse
          members are breaking in from other sides.

          
          BOONE: They're everywhere!

          

          219M. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          The Nightbreed children hear the sound of slaughter approaching. One
          of the Breed with enormous, dark eyes, speaks.

          
          LEOPARDO: We can't stay here.

          
          NARCISSE: He told us to.

          
          LEOPARDO: He can't help us. He's too late.

          

          219N. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          We see the posse shooting Breed as they move towards the children.
          Several are entering doorways that lead underground.

          Posse enter the core, firing at anything that moves.

          

          219P. INT. BERSERKERS' CORRIDOR


          
          Lylesburg, his leg broken, is hobbling towards the Berserkers'
          chamber, as the sound of gunfire gets nearer.

          

          219Q. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Narcisse still keeps an increasingly panicked group of Breed and
          children from scattering.

          
          Pettine and two bloodied, grinning posse appear through the smoke.

          
          PETTINE: Look what we got here! A freak-show nursery school.

          
          The group back away, but two more posse members appear, one with a
          flame-thrower, another with grenades.

          
          PETTINE: Say goodnight.

          
          BOONE [from above]: Goodnight.

          
          Pettine looks up. Framed against the stars, Boone. He drops on
          Pettine breaking the man's neck. Then he and Narcisse lead the attack
          against the posse, dispatching them all.

          
          NARCISSE: What way's safe?

          
          BOONE: The west wall! But be quick! I'm going after Eigerman.

          

          219R. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          
          Leroy and Lude hide around the corner of a mausoleum. Two posse
          members are beating a Breed up with their rifle butts. Leroy heads
          out to help.

          
          LUDE: What's the plan?

          
          LEROY: The usual. You take the big guy. [he yells to the Naturals]
          Hey!

          
          They turn. Leroy raises his hands in surrender.

          
          LEROY: I wouldn't do that if I were you.

          
          1ST POSSE: Give me a good reason why not.

          
          LEROY: I'll give you two!

          
          The snakes emerge from his body.

          
          1ST POSSE: Shit!

          
          He raises his gun, but Lude flips over his head, landing behind him
          and in front of the 2nd posse member. Lude's eyes blaze.

          
          LUDE: Pretty gun.

          
          The 2nd posse member looks down at his hands. The gun is covered in
          snakes. He drops the gun. When he looks up Lude has gone. He turns
          again, backing off towards a monument. Lude is there, a living devil
          hidden amongst the carved variety. He takes hold of the man, turning
          him round and driving his horns into the man's neck. He staggers
          back, blood pouring from the opened wounds.

          
          Leroy, meanwhile, draws the 1st into an embrace. The snakes strike.
          Poisoned, the man dies.

          
          LEROY: Look at this mess.

          
          LUDE: Just like the old days.

          

          219S. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          
          Kane leads two cops through the mayhem, firing to right and left. He
          shoots a Breed against one of the mausoleums. Blood is spattered on
          his face.

          
          KANE: Look at these bastards. Fucking freaks.

          
          He wipes the blood from his face. Then he takes off his spectacles,
          and wipes the blood off them. As he does so 1st cop yelps.

          
          1ST COP: Yow!

          
          KANE: What?

          
          1st cop pulls a quill from the back of his neck.

          
          1ST COP: Where the fuck did that come from?

          
          Kane puts his spectacles back on, and sees Shuna Sassi in one of the
          mausoleums. She moves sexily in the shadows. Kane grins and starts to
          approach.

          
          2ND COP: Wait...

          
          KANE: It's just a girl...

          
          1st cop is still rubbing the back of his neck. He is looking sick now.

          
          1ST COP: I don't...feel...so...good...

          
          Kane pushes the mausoleum grille open, as the 1st cop kneels over,
          face down. The 2nd cop kneels to help him. Meanwhile,
          Kane has stepped into the mausoleum. Shuna is in the corner, her
          spines covered with the swaths of red cloth.

          
          KANE: It's OK, Baby.

          
          He lowers his gun. Outside the 2nd cop turns the 1st over. He is
          frothing at the mouth, his face blotchy and sweating.

          
          2ND COP: Oh shit! Kane!

          
          Inside again, Shuna drops her cloth and leaps at Kane. 2nd cop now
          approaches the mausoleum.

          
          2ND COP: Kane?

          
          As he reaches the threshold, Kane staggers out, his body and face
          pierced in dozens of places with Shuna's spines. He reaches for 2nd
          cop.

          
          2ND COP: Keep away from me!

          
          In panic, he fires at Kane, who falls to the ground. As the smoke
          clears a hand appears and strokes his cheek. He turns. It's Shuna. He
          screams, and falls to the ground at her feet, his arm covered in
          spines. He twitches, and dies. She drops her swath of red cloth over
          the faces of the three dead men.

          Cut to Eigerman's leering, grinning face as he fires at Breed.
          Ashberry emerges from the shadows and grabs him.

          
          ASHBERRY:. Please, you've got to stop...[takes out a pistol - points
          it) There's children down there, you're killing children!

          
          EIGERMAN: Go ahead, faggot, [pauses contemptuously] You haven't got
          the balls to pull the trigger.

          
          Eigerman snatches the gun away and pistol-whips him to the ground.
          Eigerman draws a bead on Ashberry's forehead.

          
          EIGERMAN [cont.]: Lemme show you how it's done...

          
          Nearby, Joyce sees them, draws his weapon, ready to fire at 
          Eigerman when a shadow passes over him. He ducks, his expression 
          changing from horror to wonder.

          
          ASHBERRY [eyes closed-hands clasped fervently]: Father, I am
          heartily sorry for having offended thee...

          
          EIGERMAN: Sorry, Padre. Nobody's listening...[prepares to shoot]

          
          BOONE [V.O.]: I hear you.

          
          Eigerman turns, looks and fires as Boone leaps at him. He roars,
          effortlessly picks Eigerman up and body-slams him against the wall of
          Midian.

          
          BOONE [cont.] [to Ashberry]: Get up!

          
          ASHBERRY: Don't kill me!

          
          BOONE: Run, go on! We don't like priests here.

          
          Ashberry pulls at his collar, tears it off, clings to Boone.

          
          ASHBERRY: No, no, take me, I have to see.

          
          Boone gets a sense of his commitment. He heads off. Ashberry
          follows. And, at a distance, so does Joyce.

          Boone races through the walkways, Ashberry following. There is
          pitched hand-to-hand battle on every side. Nightbreed are prevailing
          in some; in others the mob repeats scenes from the history we
          witnessed earlier: Breed being beaten or burned to death, impaled on
          stakes. Boone assists some along the way, pulling off their
          assailants.

          Lylesburg has reached the door of the Berserkers' chamber. He puts
          the key in the lock. A shout stops him turning it. He looks towards a
          man with a laser-sight rifle.

          
          MAN: Yo!

          
          The light from the rifle plays on Lylesburg's robes.

          
          MAN: Watch the pretty light.

          
          It moves up towards Lylesburg's face, until it's centred on his
          forehead. The man fires, killing his victim. Lylesburg falls, hanging
          from the door by the key chain around his neck. His many eyes have
          opened. The man grins. Then hears a noise behind him. He turns to see
          the Ferreol Vees, creatures like Manta Rays that glide through the
          air, appearing around the corner. They swoop towards him, separating.
          The middle one opens its mouth as it strikes his face. He is
          eclipsed. When the Vees pass on down the corridor, the man's face is
          a bloody wreck. He falls to the floor, just out of reach
          of the Berserkers, who roar their frustration.

          Boone and Ashberry are on one of the walkways, which are swinging
          violently. Boone hears the Berserkers' roar, and heads towards the
          door that leads into their corridor, leaving Ashberry on the bridge,
          tears pouring down his face. Then he follows Boone. As he reaches the
          ledge he looks back to see a fabulous beast, the Mezzick-Muul, and
          its beautiful rider, Diadaria, appear. He watches, awestruck.

          Boone reaches the door. Lylesburg is dead. Boone pulls the key from
          off Lylesburg's neck, and pulls the corpse aside. Then he turns the
          key in the lock. The door opens. A rush of filthy wind emerges from
          the chamber beyond. Then the Berserkers appear: lethal brutes, all
          teeth, armour and muscle. One of them, Ghost, takes hold of Boone,
          and there's a beat when it seems certain to dispatch him.

          
          Then a burst of light from Baphomet's chamber spills over them, and
          there's a roar from their unseen God. They let Boone go, and they're
          away. Boone looks towards the chamber, then heads back towards the
          surface.

          Tommy leads a line of five posse members who have cornered a number
          of wounded Breed against one of the walls. One of the
          creatures attempts to scramble away. Tommy guns him down. He turns
          to the other gunmen.

          
          TOMMY: Watch this!

          
          The two posse members prepare to kill the Breed. The ground around
          them begins to shudder, and a fist bursts out of the ground and grabs
          the leg of a posse member and drags him down.

          
          Another fist then bursts out of the ground.

          
          Then in silhouette the Berserkers climb out of the earth beside the
          posse. Two of the posse turn, and fire at the Berserkers, who advance
          through the hail of the bullets, and quickly dispatch the two gunmen.
          Tommy has begun to fire at the feet of the cornered Breed, obliging
          them to dance.

          
          TOMMY [laughs]: Dance, fuckers!

          
          The display gets appreciative hoots and laughter from the three
          surviving posse members, who - like Tommy - are as yet unaware that
          the Berserkers are advancing on them. Tommy continues to fire at the
          ground around the Breed, as one by one his three companions are
          dispatched by the Berserkers. We close in on Tommy, whose face is
          suddenly spattered with blood. He stops firing. He looks round to
          find himself surrounded by Berserkers. The shadows fall over him.
          Their hands take hold of him.

          
          We see the shadow of what they do to him on the walls: his body is
          torn apart.

          
          We cut to the Berserkers. Ghost has Tommy's gun, with the hand still
          attached. He tosses it aside, roaring like King Kong. The wounded
          Breed hurry away as the Berserkers head off in search of
          new mischief.

          

          237. EXT. NECROPOLIS NEAR THE GATES NIGHT


          
          With the tide turning inside the Necropolis, a disorganized retreat
          is underway. Eigerman is at the gate watching the remains of his
          'army' staggering away. Joyce is watching the scene.

          
          EIGERMAN: Stand your ground! Stand your ground! They've got to come
          this way. We can mow 'em down.

          
          He climbs up on a vehicle which is parked at the gates. In the
          driving seat is Gibbs. Beside him, a woman, her face smoke-stained,
          her expression near catatonic.

          
          EIGERMAN: Gibbs?

          
          GIBBS: Sir?

          
          EIGERMAN: Lights!

          
          Gibbs switches the lights on, to pierce the smoke. Bad move. The
          illumination shows the Berserkers appearing. They approach the
          vehicle.

          
          EIGERMAN: Shit!

          
          Eigerman jumps from the vehicle, as the retreating posse fire at the
          Berserkers. It's a useless response. Bloodied but unbowed, the
          Berserkers run at the vehicles. The woman throws herself out, but
          Gibbs isn't quick enough. One of the Berserkers pushes the vehicle up
          the wall of the Necropolis, and Blatz, a small, vicious creature,
          stamps on the roof. Inside, Gibbs cowers as the roof is beaten in. He
          is crushed.

          
          Joyce, who has been watching this entire scene, moves away from the
          gate towards the Necropolis. The fires are dying down
          somewhat, and an eerie half-light bathes the scene he moves through.
          A few surviving posse hurry away, firing at every movement in the
          shadows.

          
          Back at the gate we see one of the escaping Berserkers flip another
          car over, while his brothers dispatch posse members. The survivors
          simply drop their weapons and flee.

          hard. He goes to her, gathers her up gently in his arms. Babette
          clings to him; he sees her arms are partially transformed into claws,
          but he keeps holding her. 

          
          Boone emerges from the depths, into the wrecked mausoleum.

          vision.

          
          BABETTE: Falling!

          

          241. EXT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          Chaos, and collapse. Earth is falling all around. Lori picks herself
          up and finds her way back up is blocked by debris. She has no choice
          but to cross the swaying walkways, while the air thickens with dust
          and smoke.

          
          There are only one or two Breed left alive down here, desperately
          collecting their belongings. They exit the chamber leaving the
          smoking bowls...We track towards the bowls, as the contents brighten
          and bubble.

          

          241A. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          Lori descends a flight of stairs, to find Peloquin badly wounded at
          the bottom.

          
          PELOQUIN: It's all over. I didn't believe the prophesies and now
          it's all over.

          
          LORI: What prophesies?

          
          Peloquin takes her arm.

          
          PELOQUIN: You want to see?

          

          241B. INT. ENTRANCE TO MURAL CHAMBER NIGHT


          
          Peloquin pushes Lori ahead of him.

          
          PELOQUIN: See?

          
          We track towards the mural. Lori can barely believe her eyes. Here,
          laid out on the walls, is a whole history; and featured amongst its
          more recent additions, the face of Boone.

          
          PELOQUIN: Yes, it's him.

          
          Boone squatting in front of his fire of love letters. Boone dead in
          the reeds.

          
          PELOQUIN: All these years waiting for a saviour. But he hasn't saved
          us. He's destroyed us. I made him, and he's destroyed us.

          
          LORI: Made him?

          
          PELOQUIN: The bite was mine. The bite that mocks death.

          
          LORI: That doesn't make him yours. I belong here on this wall, just
          as much as you do. Why aren't I here?

          
          PELOQUIN: You're still a Natural. Go back while you've still got a
          life. Join your tribe.

          
          LORI: That? My tribe? Not any longer.

          
          PELOQUIN: Then die with us. It's over.

          
          Peloquin exits. Lori looks back at the images on the walls once
          more. Then she exits.

          

          242. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone, Joyce and Babette approach the hole where Lori fell.

          
          BABETTE: Let me down. I can't go any further.

          
          BOONE: Why not?

          
          BABETTE [looking down into the hole]: Baphomet.

          
          BOONE [to Joyce]: Take her. Run.

          
          Joyce nods and moves off with her into the smoke. As she disappears,
          Decker steps forward from the smoke.

          
          DECKER: Quite a dance, huh? Death everywhere and you and me in the
          middle. Catch!

          
          He throws the head of a Breed at Boone.

          
          DECKER: Even the dead can die!

          
          Then Decker strikes out at him, slashing at Boone's face. Boone
          falls backwards. At the last moment he catches hold of Decker,
          pulling him down into the hole and together they tumble into the
          earth.

          

          243. SCENE DELETED

          

          244. INT. MIDIAN


          
          Boone and Decker land on one of the rope bridges. Boone heads across
          it, pursued by Decker, who slashes at his neck, cutting him.

          
          DECKER: Almost!

          
          Boone falls back. Decker closes on him, the knives at his neck. The
          force of his stabs, which miss Boone's neck, break the boards of the
          bridge. Boone braces his feet beneath Decker and tosses him over.
          Decker gets up and approaches him again, slashing the ropes of the
          bridge with his blades as he comes. The fighters connect and
          struggle, their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the
          bridge, dropping them down another level. Decker lands very heavily,
          and lies still. Boone gets up. His exit along the bridge in one
          direction is blocked. He has to step past Decker who doesn't
          move. Only when Boone has stepped beyond him does Decker get up,
          pursuing Boone across the bridge, and flinging one of the
          knives at his victim's back. The blade cuts straight through Boone,
          sticking out from his chest a good six inches. He turns, his fury
          transforming him into a more extreme creature. Decker comes at Boone
          with a second blade, slashing at Boone's neck. The battle carries
          them off the bridge onto the stairs. Decker takes hold of Boone's
          hair, preparing to deliver the coup de grace. Boone reaches for a
          weapon, finds a skull, and smashes it into the mask. Decker lets go.
          Boone tumbles off the stairs, falling face down on a card table.

          
          Decker follows down the stairs. Boone pulls the table off his chest,
          leaving the Ace of Hearts on the blade in his chest. Decker follows
          through, driving Boone back into one of the Breed's rooms, where the
          fight continues. Decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to
          disarm Boone, who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with.
          Boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates, delivering blow after
          blow against Decker, eventually knocking the knife from his hand and
          driving him out on to the ledge once more. Decker teeters on the
          edge, now defenceless. Boone approaches.

          
          BOONE: Want to dance?

          
          He snatches the mask off Decker's face and draws him close, impaling
          Decker on his own blade. Decker screams.

          
          Then Boone pushes him off the blade, and over the edge of the ledge.
          Decker falls.

          
          Boone stands on the ledge, and spits down at the corpse. As he does
          so he hears the same roar from Baphomet that called the
          Berserkers from harming him. Out of it, comes Baphomet's face.

          
          BAPHOMET [V.O.]: Boone!

          

          244A. INT. LYLESBURG'S CHAMBER


          
          The chamber is empty of life. There are two or three corpses on the
          floor. We approach the central dais, on which is perched the statue
          of Baphomet, surrounded by six white heads. Momentarily, lines of
          light break from the statue's head and strike the white heads, which
          in turn begin to glow...

          

          244B. INT. VARIOUS CHAMBERS


          
          In the chambers we've seen before we see copies of the six statues,
          in front of which are bowls of Baphomet's fluid...They begin to glow,
          the brightness building. Sparks rise from the fluid.

          

          245. INT. BERSERKERS' CORRIDOR


          
          Lori sits, exhausted, in the corridor. She looks up to see Boone,
          with the knife still transfixing him.

          
          LORI: My God...

          
          BOONE: Decker's dead. Take the knife out.

          
          Lori pulls the knife from him, and throws it down.

          
          BAPHOMET [V.O.]: Boone!

          
          LORI: Don't go...

          
          BOONE: I'm. responsible. I have to.

          
          Lori and Boone head down the corridor, passing Ashberry, who is
          standing in the shadows.

          
          Lori and Boone head down the stairs towards the chamber.

          

          246. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          Blinding light. As Boone descends into the chamber, he sees eight
          Nightbreed, surviving members of a Senior Council, Rachel among them,
          standing around Baphomet. They are wrapping severed limbs of
          Baphomet, preparing to include him in the exodus. His head and
          shoulders remain suspended in the light. Baphomet's lips move, making
          a terrible, eloquent sound. Rachel translates, the deep voice we hear
          coming from her lips.

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: Come closer...

          
          Boone obeys. Baphomet's remaining arm reaches down and holds Boone,
          as Baphomet's face stares down at him.

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: ...You have destroyed our refuge...

          
          BOONE: I never meant...

          
          Baphomet silences him. Boone trembles but maintains eye contact.

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: This was foretold. No refuge is forever. But you
          are charged . . .

          
          BOONE: Yes...

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: ...You must rebuild what you've destroyed.

          
          BOONE: Where?

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: That you must find yourself. In the world above.

          
          BOONE: I don't...I don't know how...

          
          RACHEL/BAPHOMET: You shall not be alone. You will find me there and
          heal me. [holds him close] You are not Boone...

          
          And now the words emerge from Baphomet himself, shaking the chamber.

          
          BAPHOMET: ...you are Cabal!

          
          Boone/Cabal is released. Baphomet is consumed in light. The Council
          move towards him to finish their task.

          
          LORI [O.S.]: Boone?

          
          Boone/Cabal turns; Lori stands at the bottom of the slope, offering
          a hand. He takes it, they start up the slope.

          
          Cowering in a niche inside the chamber, out of sight, watching in
          wonder is Ashberry. Transfixed by Baphomet, he crosses himself.

          
          Boone/Cabal glances back. The Council receive pieces of Baphomet
          from the light wrapping his smoking fragments in
          shrouds. The light builds to its brightest level. Pieces of ceiling
          begin to fall.

          

          246A. INT. VARIOUS CHAMBERS


          
          The bowls start to explode with sparks of white light.

          

          247. INT. BELOW MIDIAN


          
          Boone/Cabal and Lori race up towards the surface, as Midian
          continues to collapse around them.

          

          248. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          Ashberry descends the stairs into the blaze of light. Tears pour
          down his cheeks.

          
          He watches as the Council prepare to take down Baphomet's head.

          
          Near to him is one of the bowls of Baphomet's light. Ashberry
          approaches it, hungry for a taste of this glory. He reaches to touch
          the bowl. As he does so Baphomet's eyes fix on him. The bowl flips in
          the air. The fluid it holds rains down on Ashberry like acid. He
          falls back, his body smoking.

          

          249. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT


          
          Boone/Cabal and Lori reach the surface and race through the ruined
          Necropolis, flames all around them. And then, behind them ...

          

          250. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          The tentacles attached to Baphomet's head are detached.

          
          The blaze of light instantly begins to diminish...

          

          250A. INT. MIDIAN CORE


          
          The lights start to go out in the core, and earth begins to pour
          from the tunnels.

          
          We see it flood the various corridors, with a shuddering roar.

          

          250B. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER


          
          We glimpse Baphomet's head being covered by the Council, as the
          roars increase...

          

          CUT TO:

          

          251. EXT. OUTSIDE THE GATES NIGHT


          
          Boone/Cabal and Lori find Joyce, holding Babette, protecting her,
          near the gates.

          
          Joyce steps back from the form of Rachel, who pulls her veils around
          her and holds out her arms.

          
          RACHEL: Give me my child...

          
          Joyce looks at Lori, Boone/Cabal, at Babette and Rachel. He tenderly
          hands the child over. Rachel holds Babette and they both disappear
          into the darkness.

          
          JOYCE [to Boone/Cabal]: ...I never understood...nobody ever told me...

          
          He steps away from them and the night engulfs him.

          The roar ceases. Silence.

          

          254. EXT. NECROPOLIS


          
          Lori and Boone stand in the reeds as the last, bright bloom of the
          fires dies away on their faces. Figures move away through the smoke,
          creatures we recognize. The drummer beats out a tattoo as they depart.

          
          Narcisse appears from the darkness. As he does so, a final explosion
          roars up from the underground. In the smoke pillar above the site,
          Baphomet's image momentarily appears before the wind disperses it.

          
          NARCISSE: Never piss off a God.

          
          Lori looks up into the sky.

          

          CUT TO:

          
          Lori's P.O.V. of the sky, with other Breed, spirits of smoke and
          light, moving away into the night.

          
          LORI: Where are they going?

          
          NARCISSE: Any hiding place they can find. It'll be dawn soon.

          
          BOONE: When I need you where will I find you?

          
          NARCISSE: You'll find me. And you will need me.

          
          He reaches to shake Boone's hand.

          
          NARCISSE: Never touched a legend before.

          
          He laughs his manic laugh.

          
          NARCISSE [cont.] [to Lori]: Good night, pretty.

          
          He fades into the night, the laughter going with him.

          

          255. EXT. NEAR MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          In the distance, the burning ruins of Midian. The wind sighs in the
          moonlit reeds. Cabal and Lori reach the top of the hill, turn and
          look down, standing apart.

          
          CABAL: I'll have to start tonight.

          
          LORI: I'll go with you, Boone.

          
          CABAL: I'm not Boone, Lori. Do you understand? I belong to the Breed
          now.

          
          LORI: Then make me belong too; they made you one of them, you can do
          it to me...

          
          CABAL: I can't...

          
          LORI: I want to be with you.

          
          CABAL: I'll come back for you when I'm finished...

          
          LORI: And when's that gonna be, when I'm ninety and you're still the
          way you are? I went through hell to find you and you
          just, just walk away from me? [pause; broken-hearted] Well go on,
          then, just go. Go on! What more do you want? Leave me some dignity,
          for Christ's sake!

          
          Pause. She turns away, trying not to show him her pain. Cabal turns
          to go. Lori turns back, sees him going. She can't bear it, looks
          around, sees Decker's briefcase lying beside the police car. Runs to
          it, finds a knife.

          
          LORI: Boone!

          
          He turns. She puts the blade to her belly and drives it in.

          
          CABAL: Lori, NO!

          
          She cries out and sinks to the ground in terrible pain. He reaches
          her and holds her in his arms.

          
          LORI: I lied, I lied, you're all I want.

          
          CABAL: Don't die, God, Lori, don't die...

          
          LORI: Well why don't you do something about it, God damn it...
          remember what you said...[fading]...quickly...

          
          He raises her neck to his mouth. Her eyes flicker closed. He bites.
          A fatal, bloody kiss. He rises from her. Her eyes are closed.

          
          CABAL: ...too late?...Oh God, too late...

          
          Her eyes open. She's turned.

          
          LORI: You said you'd never leave me.

          
          She grins, presses up to kiss his bloodied mouth. Camera moves up
          off them to find the moon and we:

          255A. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY


          
          We track through the ruins of the Necropolis. The walls are
          blackened by fires that are almost extinguished; corpses [human and
          Breed] lie in barely distinguishable bundles, from which partially
          cremated limbs jut. Smoke hangs in the air. From the distance we see
          Eigerman, going amongst the corpses, reclaiming guns, bullets and
          grenades. As we get closer we realize that he is a broken man, his
          face dirty, his eyes lunatic. He's been crying, the tracks marking
          the dirt.

          
          Suddenly, he hears a noise, and stands up to see a large figure
          appearing from the smoke. He goes for his own gun, levelling it at
          the figure as it approaches.

          
          EIGERMAN: Keep your distance!

          
          The figure keeps coming, emerging from the smoke. It's Ashberry. He
          has been transformed by the confrontation with Baphomet. His hair has
          been almost burned away entirely and there is a subtle
          reconfiguration in the shape of his skull. His clothes are in
          tatters. There are hints that his once broken body, poisoned by
          alcohol, has taken on new strength. He looks as insane as Eigerman,
          but stronger in his lunacy. There's a dangerous fervour in his eyes.

          
          ASHBERRY: I saw their God...I saw him...

          
          EIGERMAN: What the hell are you talking about?

          
          ASHBERRY: I can still smell him. He's out there...

          
          Ashberry walks past Eigerman towards the exit from Necropolis.

          
          EIGERMAN: You mean you can find them?

          
          ASHBERRY: Oh yes.

          
          EIGERMAN: We'll go together then. You can lead me to the bastards.
          Then I'll wipe them all away.

          
          ASHBERRY: No. They're mine. Their God burned me. I want to burn him
          back. All of them. Burn them all away.

          
          EIGERMAN: You can't, you don't have the wits ...

          
          Ashberry turns on him, his face wild. He takes hold of Eigerman by
          the neck, his fingers digging into the muscle. Blood runs. Eigerman
          tries to raise the gun but Ashberry takes hold of the man's hand, and
          summarily snaps his wrist. The gun is dropped. Ashberry starts to
          lift Eigerman up off the ground. The policeman's flailings stop
          suddenly. The head lolls. Ashberry flings the body aside, and starts
          out of the Necropolis. As he approaches the exit he looks up.
          Sunlight falls on his face.

          

          CUT TO:

          

          256. EXT. MOON NIGHT


          
          Shining, full. We move down to find a derelict barn, standing alone
          in a vast field.

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          257. INT. BARN NIGHT


          
          We track through the darkness to find Rachel, Babette, Kinski and a
          number of other refugees and children of Midian, staring out at the
          night.

          
          BABETTE: ...who will come for us?

          
          KINSKI: His name is Cabal. He unmade Midian.

          
          BABETTE: How soon?

          
          RACHEL: On the next wind. If not tonight, then tomorrow.

          
          Babette gazes out over the cornfields.

          
          BABETTE: On the next wind...

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          258. EXT. HILL NIGHT


          
          Cabal and Lori, standing on the hill, against a background of stars.

          
          BABETTE [V.O.]: ...if not tonight...tomorrow...

          

          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          259. INT. BELOW MIDIAN NIGHT


          
          Moving through the ruined chambers, illuminated by dying flickers of
          flame, we find and track along the end of the heroic mosaic/mural. It
          tells, in a rush of images, the story of the ruin of Midian.

          
          Camera comes to a stop on the final image: Cabal and Lori, as we
          just saw them, on a hill, framed against the star-filled heavens.

          
          The sound of the wind...

          
          Fade to black.
The script to
 Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas

NARRATOR
'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems, in a place 
that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.  For the story that you are 
about to be told, took place in the holiday worlds of old.  Now, you've 
probably wondered where holidays come from.  If you haven't, I'd say it's 
time you begun.

You're such a scream, Jack

MAYOR
A frightening and honorable mention goes to the fabulous Dark Lagoon leeches

SAX PLAYER
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

JACK
Yeah, I guess so.  Just like last year and the year before that and the 
year before that.

[entering graveyard] 

	Jack's Lament
	Performed by Danny Elfman

There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night

I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm the master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears

[leaving graveyard and entering forest]

SALLY
Jack, I know how you feel.  

[Sally gathers herbs]

[back at Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, you've come back.

SALLY
I had to.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
For this?

[showing her arm]

SALLY
Yes.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Shall we then.
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea
 and run off --

SALLY
Three times!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You're mine you know!  I made you with my own hands.

SALLY
You can make other creations.  I'm restless, I can't help it.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
It's a phase my dear, it'll pass.  We need to be patient that's all.

SALLY
But, I don't want to be patient.

No Zero, not now.  I'm not in the mood.

MAYOR
Morning gents [to the band]

MAYOR

[getting worried, switches face and knocks with desperation then switch 
back to happy face]

MAYOR
Jack?  I've got the plans for next Halloween.  I need to go over them 
with you so we can get started.  

MAYOR (with worried face)
Jack, please, I'm only an elected an official here, I can't make 
decisions by myself.  Jack, answer me!!

[falls down steps]

ACCORDION PLAYER
He's not home.

JACK
Whoa!!!!

	What's This?
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this? 
What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?

What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
Christmas Town, hmm...

SANDY CLAWS
Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho

JACK
hmm..

[Halloweentown]

CLOWN
This has never happened before.

Witch
It's suspicious.

Witch (little)
It's peculiar.

VAMPIRES
It's scary.

MAYOR
Stand aside.

WEREWOLF
grrrr

MAYOR
Coming through.  We've got find Jack.  There's only 365 days left till 
next Halloween.

WEREWOLF
364!

MAYOR
Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check?

Clown
I looked in every mausoleum.

WITCHES
We opened the sarcophagi.

Hyde
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.

VAMPIRE
I peeked behind the Cyclops's eye.  I did!  But he wasn't there.

MAYOR
It's time to sound the alarms.

[DR. FINKELSTEIN's castle]

SALLY
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.  Bitter.  [coughing]  Worm's 
wart.  Where's that worm's wart?

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, that soup ready yet?

SALLY
Coming....lunch

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Ah, what's that?  Worm's wart, mmm, and...frog's breath.

SALLY
What's wrong?  I-I thought you liked frog's breath.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it I won't 
swallow a spoonful.

SALLY
I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon]  Oops!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You want me to starve.  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it 
is.  Me, to whom you owe your very life.

SALLY
Oh don't be silly.  [eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see.  Scrumptious.

[Dr. Finkelstein eats soup] 

[Halloween]

MAYOR
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?

VAMPIRE
Ah, this morning!

ZERO
barks

Witch
Hear that?

Witch (little)
What?

Witch
Shh!

ZERO
barks

VAMPIRE
Zero!

[fanfare as Jack and Zero arrive]

Kid
Jack's back!

MAYOR
Where have you been?

JACK
Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.

MAYOR
When?

JACK
Immediately!

MAYOR
[in his mayor truck]
Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight

[at meeting]

Clown
[giggles as he hits Sally]

JACK
Listen everyone.  I want to tell you about Christmastown.

	Town Meeting Song
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

JACK
There are objects so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

DEVIL
A box?
is it steel?

WEREWOLF
Are there locks?

HARLEOUIN DEMON
Is it filled with a pox?

DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON
A pox
How delightful, a pox

JACK
If you please
Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

WITCHES
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?

JACK
That's the point of the thing, not to know

CLOWN
It's a bat
Will it bend?

CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
It's a rat
Will it break?

UNDERSEA GAL
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake

JACK
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

Now, pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

MR. HYDE
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?

MEDIUM MR. HYDE
Let me see, let me look

SMALL MR. HYDE
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

JACK
Um, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
Small toys

WINGED DEMON
Do they bite?

MUMMY
Do they snap?

WINGED DEMON
Or explode in a sack?

CORPSE KID
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

MAYOR
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

JACK
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well...

[Jack's house]

JACK
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl.

[locks Sally away]

[dingdong]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Oh my head...the door is open.

JACK
Hel-lo

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Jack Skellington, up here my boy.

JACK
Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Is that so, whatever for?

JACK
I'm conducting a series of experiments.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
How perfectly marvelous.  Curiosity killed the cat, you know.

JACK
I know.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.

SALLY
Hmm.  Experiments?

[Jack's house]

JACK
Zero, I'm home.

[Jack examines & experiments with Xmas stuff]

JACK
Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?

[Sally's room]

[after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket...]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You can come out now if you promise to behave.  Sally.  Sally.  Oooh!  Gone 
again!

[Jack's house]

[Sally gives Jack his basket and sneaks off and picks a flower which 
catches on fire]

	Jack's Obsession
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back

He's all alone up there
Locked away inside
Never says a word
Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

JACK
Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There's so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
 
You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee

JACK
Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours!

MAYOR
Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. 
Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.  Dr. Finkelstein to the front 
of the line.

VAMPIRE
What kind of a noise is that for a baby to make?

JACK
Perhaps it can be improved?

VAMPIRES
No problem!

JACK
I knew it!  Dr. thank you for coming.  We need some of these.
[showing picture of Santa and sleigh]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Hmm.. their construction should be exceedingly simple.  I think.

MAYOR
How horrible our Xmas will be.

JACK
No--how jolly.

MAYOR
[switches face]
Oh, how jolly our Xmas will be.  [gets pelted]  What are you doing here?

Jack, Jack it's Oogie's boys!

JACK
Ah, Halloween's finest trick or treaters.  The job I have for you is top 
secret.  It requires craft, cunning, mischief.

SHOCK
And we thought you didn't like us, Jack.
[giggles]

JACK
Absolutely no one is to know about it.  Not a soul.  Now--
[whispers to LS&B] 
And one more thing -- leave that no account Ooogie Boogie out of this!

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

LOCK
I wanna do it

BARREL
Let's draw straws

SHOCK
Jack said we should work together
Three of a kind

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

SHOCK
First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

LOCK
Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

SHOCK
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Wheeee

LOCK
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

SHOCK
You're so stupid, think now
lf we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

LOCK AND SHOCK
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

BARREL
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Ummm!

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

SHOCK
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

BARREL
I'm not the dumb one

LOCK
You're no fun

SHOCK
Shut up

LOCK
Make me

SHOCK
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside

BARREL
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then, throw away the key

OOGIE BOOGIE
Sandy Claws..hahaha

[city hall]

JACK
It goes something like this.  [Jingle bells]
How about it?  Think you can manage?

PERSON INSIDE BASS

[Jingle in a flat key by the band]

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
Fantastic!  Now why don't you all practice on that and we'll be in great 
shape.  Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.  

SALLY
You certainly do, Jack.  I had the most terrible vision.

JACK
That's splendid.

SALLY
No, it was about your Xmas.  There was smoke and fire.

JACK
That not my Xmas.  My Xmas is filled with laughter and joy and this--my 
Sandy Claws outfit.  I want you to make it.

SALLY
Jack, please, listen to me--it's going to be a disaster.

JACK
How could it be--just follow the pattern.  This part is red, the trim is 
white.

SALLY
It's a mistake, Jack.

JACK
Now don't be modest, who else is clever enough to make my Sandy claws outfit.

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
I have every confidence in you.

SALLY
But it seems wrong to me, very wrong.

JACK
This device is called a nutcracker.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Jack, Jack we caught him we caught him.

JACK
Perfect!  Open it up.  Quickly!

JACK
That's not Sandy Claws!

SHOCK
It isn't?

BARREL
Who is it?

BEHEMOTH
Bunny!

JACK
Not Sandy Claws...take him back!

LOCK
We followed your instructions--

BARREL
we went through the door--

JACK
Which door?  There's more than one.  Sandy Claws is behind the door 
shaped like this.  

[shows Xmas cookie in shape of tree]

SHOCK
I told you!

[LS&B start fighting]

JACK
Arr!!  [making scary face at LS&B]

JACK
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.  Take him home first  and 
apologize again.  Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.  Treat 
him nicely.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Got it.  We'll get it right next time.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally.

IGOR
Master, the plans.

Excellent, Igor.

You don't look like yourself Jack, not at all.

JACK
Isn't that wonderful.  It couldn't be more wonderful!

SALLY
But you're the Pumpkin King.

JACK
Not anymore.  And I feel so much better now.

SALLY
Jack, I know you think something's missing.  But --

Sandy Claws in person.  What a pleasure to meet you.  Why you have

SANDY CLAWS
Where am I?

JACK
Surprised aren't you?  I knew you would be.  You don't need to have 
another worry about Xmas this year.  

SANDY CLAWS
What?

JACK
Consider this a vacation Sandy,  a reward.  It's your turn to take it easy.

SANDY CLAWS
But there must be some mistake!

JACK
See that he's comfortable.  Just a second fellows.  Of course, that's 
what I'm missing.  

SANDY CLAWS
But --

JACK
Thanks!  [took Sandy's hat]

SANDY CLAWS
You just can't...  Hold on where are we going now?

This is worse than I thought, much worse.  I know...

SANDY CLAWS
Me?  On vacation on Xmas eve?

To Oogie boogie, of course.  There isn't anywhere in the whole world more 
comfortable than that and Jack said to make him comfortable.  Didn't he?

OOGIE BOOGIE
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
There's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time
You hear the boogie song, ohhh

Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

OOGIE BOOGIE
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny, I'm laughing
You really are too much
And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

SANTA
What are you going to do?

OOGIE BOOGIE
I'm gonna do the best I can

Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
With lives on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

SANTA
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

OOGIE BOOGIE
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere

	Sally's Song
	Performed by Catherine O'Hara

I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend

And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last

And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one

smithereens.  Terrible, terrible news.

[back to "normal" town]

Cop
[in car]
Attention, attention citizens.  Terrible news.  There's still no sign of 
Santa Claus.  Although the impostor has been shot down, it looks like 
Xmas will have to be canceled this year.  I repeat the impostor has been 
shot down but there's still no sign ......

	Poor Jack
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What have I done? 
What have I done?
How could I be so blind?
All is lost, where was I?
Spoiled all, spoiled all
Everything's gone all wrong

What have I done?
What have I done?
Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years they'll find me
Only dust and a plaque
That reads, 'Here Lies Poor Old Jack"

But I never intended all this madness, never
And nobody really understood, well how could they?
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should?

Well, what the heck, I went and did my best
And, by god, I really tasted something swell
And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did

And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my old bony self again
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
That's right! I am the Pumpkin King, ha, ha, ha, ha

And I just can't wait until next Halloween
'Cause I've got some new ideas that will really make them scream
And, by God, I'm really going to give it all my might
Uh oh, I hope there's still time to set things right
Sandy Claws, hmm

SALLY
You wait till Jack hears about this.  By the time he's through with you,

[entering graveyard] 

	Jack's Lament
	Performed by Danny Elfman

There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night

I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm the master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears

[leaving graveyard and entering forest]

SALLY
Jack, I know how you feel.  

[Sally gathers herbs]

[back at Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, you've come back.

SALLY
I had to.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
For this?

[showing her arm]

SALLY
Yes.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Shall we then.
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea
 and run off --

SALLY
Three times!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You're mine you know!  I made you with my own hands.

SALLY
You can make other creations.  I'm restless, I can't help it.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
It's a phase my dear, it'll pass.  We need to be patient that's all.

But, I don't want to be patient.

MAYOR
Jack, you home?

[getting worried, switches face and knocks with desperation then switch 
back to happy face]

MAYOR
Jack?  I've got the plans for next Halloween.  I need to go over them 
with you so we can get started.  

MAYOR (with worried face)
Jack, please, I'm only an elected an official here, I can't make 
decisions by myself.  Jack, answer me!!

[falls down steps]

ACCORDION PLAYER
He's not home.

MAYOR
Where is he?

SAX PLAYER
He hasn't been home all night.

Whoa!!!!

	What's This?
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this? 
What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?

What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
Christmas Town, hmm...

SANDY CLAWS
Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho

JACK
hmm..

[Halloweentown]

CLOWN
This has never happened before.

Witch
It's suspicious.

Witch (little)
It's peculiar.

VAMPIRES
It's scary.

MAYOR
Stand aside.

WEREWOLF
grrrr

MAYOR
Coming through.  We've got find Jack.  There's only 365 days left till 
next Halloween.

WEREWOLF
364!

MAYOR
Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check?

Clown
I looked in every mausoleum.

WITCHES
We opened the sarcophagi.

Hyde
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.

VAMPIRE
I peeked behind the Cyclops's eye.  I did!  But he wasn't there.

MAYOR
It's time to sound the alarms.

[DR. FINKELSTEIN's castle]

SALLY
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.  Bitter.  [coughing]  Worm's 
wart.  Where's that worm's wart?

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, that soup ready yet?

SALLY
Coming....lunch

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Ah, what's that?  Worm's wart, mmm, and...frog's breath.

SALLY
What's wrong?  I-I thought you liked frog's breath.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it I won't 
swallow a spoonful.

SALLY
I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon]  Oops!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You want me to starve.  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it 
is.  Me, to whom you owe your very life.

SALLY
Oh don't be silly.  [eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see.  Scrumptious.

[Dr. Finkelstein eats soup] 

[Halloween]

MAYOR
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?

VAMPIRE
Ah, this morning!

ZERO
barks

Witch
Hear that?

Witch (little)
What?

Witch
Shh!

ZERO
barks

VAMPIRE
Zero!

[fanfare as Jack and Zero arrive]

Kid
Jack's back!

MAYOR
Where have you been?

JACK
Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.

MAYOR
When?

JACK
Immediately!

MAYOR
[in his mayor truck]
Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight

[at meeting]

Clown
[giggles as he hits Sally]

JACK
Listen everyone.  I want to tell you about Christmastown.

	Town Meeting Song
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

JACK
There are objects so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

DEVIL
A box?
is it steel?

WEREWOLF
Are there locks?

HARLEOUIN DEMON
Is it filled with a pox?

DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON
A pox
How delightful, a pox

JACK
If you please
Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

WITCHES
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?

JACK
That's the point of the thing, not to know

CLOWN
It's a bat
Will it bend?

CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
It's a rat
Will it break?

UNDERSEA GAL
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake

JACK
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

Now, pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

MR. HYDE
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?

MEDIUM MR. HYDE
Let me see, let me look

SMALL MR. HYDE
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

JACK
Um, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
Small toys

WINGED DEMON
Do they bite?

MUMMY
Do they snap?

WINGED DEMON
Or explode in a sack?

CORPSE KID
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

MAYOR
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

JACK
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well...

[Jack's house]

JACK
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl.

[locks Sally away]

[dingdong]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Oh my head...the door is open.

JACK
Hel-lo

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Jack Skellington, up here my boy.

JACK
Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Is that so, whatever for?

JACK
I'm conducting a series of experiments.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
How perfectly marvelous.  Curiosity killed the cat, you know.

JACK
I know.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.

SALLY
Hmm.  Experiments?

[Jack's house]

JACK
Zero, I'm home.

[Jack examines & experiments with Xmas stuff]

JACK
Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?

[Sally's room]

[after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket...]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You can come out now if you promise to behave.  Sally.  Sally.  Oooh!  Gone 
again!

[Jack's house]

[Sally gives Jack his basket and sneaks off and picks a flower which 
catches on fire]

	Jack's Obsession
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back

He's all alone up there
Locked away inside
Never says a word
Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

JACK
Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There's so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
 
You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee

JACK
Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours!

MAYOR
Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. 
Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.  Dr. Finkelstein to the front 
of the line.

VAMPIRE
What kind of a noise is that for a baby to make?

JACK
Perhaps it can be improved?

VAMPIRES
No problem!

JACK
I knew it!  Dr. thank you for coming.  We need some of these.
[showing picture of Santa and sleigh]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Hmm.. their construction should be exceedingly simple.  I think.

MAYOR
How horrible our Xmas will be.

JACK
No--how jolly.

MAYOR
[switches face]
Oh, how jolly our Xmas will be.  [gets pelted]  What are you doing here?

MAYOR
Jack, Jack it's Oogie's boys!

JACK
Ah, Halloween's finest trick or treaters.  The job I have for you is top 
secret.  It requires craft, cunning, mischief.

SHOCK
And we thought you didn't like us, Jack.
[giggles]

JACK
Absolutely no one is to know about it.  Not a soul.  Now--
[whispers to LS&B] 
And one more thing -- leave that no account Ooogie Boogie out of this!

BARREL
Whatever you say, Jack.

SHOCK
Of course Jack.

LOCK
Wouldn't dream of it Jack.

	Kidnap the Sandy Claws
	Performed by Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

LOCK
I wanna do it

BARREL
Let's draw straws

SHOCK
Jack said we should work together
Three of a kind

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

SHOCK
First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

LOCK
Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

SHOCK
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Wheeee

LOCK
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

SHOCK
You're so stupid, think now
lf we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

LOCK AND SHOCK
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

BARREL
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Ummm!

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

SHOCK
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

BARREL
I'm not the dumb one

LOCK
You're no fun

SHOCK
Shut up

LOCK
Make me

SHOCK
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside

BARREL
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then, throw away the key

OOGIE BOOGIE
Sandy Claws..hahaha

[city hall]

JACK
It goes something like this.  [Jingle bells]
How about it?  Think you can manage?

PERSON INSIDE BASS
a one, and a two, and a three, and a. . . 

[Jingle in a flat key by the band]

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
Fantastic!  Now why don't you all practice on that and we'll be in great 
shape.  Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.  

SALLY
You certainly do, Jack.  I had the most terrible vision.

JACK
That's splendid.

SALLY
No, it was about your Xmas.  There was smoke and fire.

JACK
That not my Xmas.  My Xmas is filled with laughter and joy and this--my 
Sandy Claws outfit.  I want you to make it.

SALLY
Jack, please, listen to me--it's going to be a disaster.

JACK
How could it be--just follow the pattern.  This part is red, the trim is 
white.

SALLY
It's a mistake, Jack.

JACK
Now don't be modest, who else is clever enough to make my Sandy claws outfit.

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
I have every confidence in you.

SALLY
But it seems wrong to me, very wrong.

[to Behemoth]

JACK
This device is called a nutcracker.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Jack, Jack we caught him we caught him.

JACK
Perfect!  Open it up.  Quickly!

[opens to reveal the Easter bunny]

JACK
That's not Sandy Claws!

SHOCK
It isn't?

BARREL
Who is it?

BEHEMOTH
Bunny!

JACK
Not Sandy Claws...take him back!

LOCK
We followed your instructions--

BARREL
we went through the door--

JACK
Which door?  There's more than one.  Sandy Claws is behind the door 
shaped like this.  

[shows Xmas cookie in shape of tree]

SHOCK
I told you!

[LS&B start fighting]

JACK
Arr!!  [making scary face at LS&B]

JACK
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.  Take him home first  and 
apologize again.  Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.  Treat 
him nicely.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Got it.  We'll get it right next time.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally.

IGOR
Master, the plans.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Excellent, Igor.

SANDY CLAWS
What?

JACK
Consider this a vacation Sandy,  a reward.  It's your turn to take it easy.

Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
There's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time
You hear the boogie song, ohhh

And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

SANTA
What are you going to do?

OOGIE BOOGIE
I'm gonna do the best I can

Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
With lives on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

SANTA
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

OOGIE BOOGIE
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer

	Sally's Song
	Performed by Catherine O'Hara

I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend

And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last

And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one

Newscaster
Reports are pouring in from all over the globe
that an impostor is shamelessly impersonating Santa Claus,
mocking and mangling this joyous holiday.

Halloween residents
[cheers]

Newscaster
Police assure us that this moment, military units are mobilizing to stop 
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.

Newscaster

JACK

SALLY

OOGIE BOOGIE
Ah, lovely.  Tickle, tickle, tickle.  Tickle, tickle, tickle.

[Sally's hands untie Sandy]

WEREWOLF

MAYOR (with white face)
I knew this Xmas thing was a bad idea.  I felt it in my gut.  Terrible 
news folks.  The worst tragedy of our times.  Jack has been blown to 
smithereens.  Terrible, terrible news.

[back to "normal" town]

Cop
[in car]
Attention, attention citizens.  Terrible news.  There's still no sign of 
Santa Claus.  Although the impostor has been shot down, it looks like 
Xmas will have to be canceled this year.  I repeat the impostor has been 
shot down but there's still no sign ......

[Jack in cemetery]

	Poor Jack
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What have I done? 
What have I done?
How could I be so blind?
All is lost, where was I?
Spoiled all, spoiled all
Everything's gone all wrong

What have I done?
What have I done?
Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years they'll find me
Only dust and a plaque
That reads, 'Here Lies Poor Old Jack"

But I never intended all this madness, never
And nobody really understood, well how could they?
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should?

Well, what the heck, I went and did my best
And, by god, I really tasted something swell
And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did

And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my old bony self again
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
That's right! I am the Pumpkin King, ha, ha, ha, ha

And I just can't wait until next Halloween
'Cause I've got some new ideas that will really make them scream
And, by God, I'm really going to give it all my might
Uh oh, I hope there's still time to set things right
Sandy Claws, hmm

[Oogie lair]

SALLY
You wait till Jack hears about this.  By the time he's through with you, 
you'll be lucky if you... 

MAYOR
The king of Halloween has been blown to smithereens.  Skeleton Jack is 
now a pile of dust.

SALLY
[gasp]

JACK
Come on Zero.  Xmas isn't over yet!

OOGIE BOOGIE
What's that you were saying about luck, rag doll?

SALLY
Help, help, help, help

OOGIE BOOGIE
Sandy, looks like it's Oogie's turn to boogie.

SALLY
[scream]

OOGIE BOOGIE

SANDY CLAWS
This can't be happening!

OOGIE BOOGIE
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.  Oh, I'm feeling weak...with hunger.
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.  Haha [rolls dice]
What!  Snake eyes.  [bang on table]
Eleven!  Haha  looks like I won the jackpot!
Bye bye doll face and sandman.
Ha, ha, ha

[Jack pulls the thread that came loose that held Oogie together]

OOGIE BOOGIE
Now look what you've done.  My bugs, my bugs, my bugs, bye bye bye

JACK
Forgive me Mr. claws, I'm afraid I've made a terrible mess
of your holiday.

SANDY CLAWS
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?  The next time you get the urge to take over 
someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her!  She's the only one who makes 
any sense around this insane asylum!
Skeletons....

JACK
I hope there's still time--

SANDY CLAWS
To fix Xmas?  Of course there is, I'm Santa Claus!

[and laying a finger aside of his nose, up Oogie's chimney he rose]

SALLY
He'll fix things Jack.  He knows what to do.

JACK
How did you get down here Sally?

SALLY
Oh, I was trying to, well, I wanted to, to --

FADE IN:

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT.

	CLOSEUP of HEAVY RIVETED IRON DOORS with round handles
	covered by spider webs.

	Two "GIANTS", wearing leopard-skin shorts, iron bicep-bands and
	headbands, pull the heavy iron doors open revealing the
	INTERIOR of the MAUSOLEUM.  There is an ornate stone sarcophagus
	in the center of the room, raised up on an altar.  The back wall
	has a mantle with a bust of the Virgin Mary looking downward at
	the coffin.  There is a round red window in the center of the 
	wall.  A ray of red light shines through the window, 
	illuminating the misty fog hanging in the air.

	The giants walk into the Mausoleum.  They lift the heavy stone
	lid off of the coffin, revealing CRISWELL.  He is lying in the
	coffin on his back, with his arms crossed over his chest and 
	eyes closed.  He is wearing black suit pants, a white shirt, a
	black ribbon-like bow-tie, and a black satin cape.

	MEDIUM SHOT OF CRISWELL

	We see CRISWELL, Narrator of our tale and SOLE RULER OF THE 
	DARK WORLD, now sitting upright, slouching somewhat in his 
	coffin, glancing offscreen (at his cue card).

	During his monologue, each time Criswell looks up at the camera 
	a DRAMATIC PAUSE is inserted as he then looks back down at the
	cue card and searches for his place in order to continue.


	 			CRISWELL
			I am Criswell!  For years I have 
			told the almost unbelievable, 
			related the unreal, and shown it 
			to be more...than a fact. 
			Now I tell a tale of the

			that some of you may faint.

							FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN.

EXT. HIGHWAY IN WILDERNESS.  "NIGHT"

	A CONVERTIBLE is driving along a DESERT ROAD.  LONG SHOTS of
	the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight.  The
	desert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only
	a slight darkening to suggest day-for-night, but the car's
	headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch
	black in the dead of night.
							CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT - BOB AND SHIRLEY IN CAR.  NIGHT

	BOB and SHIRLEY are seated in the CONVERTIBLE, driving through
	the night, on a "date".  They are searching for an ancient
	CEMETERY.  MEDIUM SHOTS have a pitch black background and dark
	shadows across the car.

	Shirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob, who is
	driving.
	 
	   			SHIRLEY
 		  	We sure picked the wrong night
			to find a cemetery.  Let's turn
			back.
			
				BOB
			No.  It's on a night like this
			when the best ideas come to mind.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But does it have to be in a
			cemetery?

				BOB
			You wouldn't understand.  Seeing
			a cemetery on a night like this
			can stir in the mind the best
			ideas for a good horror story.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But there're so many wonderful
			things to write about, Bob.

				BOB
			Sure there are--and I've tried
			them all.  Plays, love stories,
			westerns, dog stories.  Huh, 
			now there was a good one, that 
			dog story all about--

	   			SHIRLEY
			    (interrupting)
			But horror stories!  Why all the
			time horror stories?

				BOB
			Shirley, I wrote for years 
			without selling a single word.

	Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around 
	Shirley, who leans closer against him.

				BOB
			My monsters have done well for 
			me.  You think I'd give that up 
			just so I could write about 
			trees, or dogs, or daisies?  
			Huhuh--Daisies!  That's it, 
			I'll write about my creatures 
			who are pushing up the daisies.

	Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles.  He tilts his head down and 
	they kiss.
 		   		BOB
			Your puritan upbringing holds
			you back from my monsters, but
			it certainly doesn't hurt your
			art of kissing.
				
				SHIRLEY
			That's life.  My kisses are
			alive.
			
				BOB
			Who's to say my monsters 
			aren't alive?		   			

	LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road

	CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley

				BOB
			All of my books are based on 
			fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps 
			why they're more interesting 
			and sell in the top spots.

				SHIRLEY
			Well, fact or not, I don't 
			see how we're going to find 
			an ancient cemetery in these 
			mountains tonight.  I can't 
			see a thing!  Let's turn back.

				BOB
			There's an old cemetery on
			this road. I've been there 
			before.

	LONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy
	mountain in the background.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm getting the jitters!  
			Let's turn back!

				BOB
			   (reluctantly)
			Okay.

	Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the 
	wheel.

				BOB
			Just as soon as I find a 
			place wide enough to turn 
			around.

	CLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			Not so fast!

	We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road.

	CLOSEUP of car wheel racing along the road.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			    (desperately)
			Not so fast!

	CLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS.  Bob steps hard on the brake,
	then pumps the brake repeatedly.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley.  Shirley screams
	and hides her face with her hands.

	ZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen
	swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile 
	crash.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious,
	on the ground.  The ground is covered by scattered leaves.  
	Misty fog swirls over them.
				(beat)
	Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily.  She looks 
	around, then looks down at Bob.  She moves toward him and
	cradles his head in her lap.
							DISSOLVE TO:
	
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Cemetery is filled with fog.  We see a large stone throne
	framed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it.  There 
	are tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on 
	the ground.

	CAMERA PANS RIGHT across a small clearing to the MAUSOLEUM.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			It is said on clear nights, 
			beneath	the cold light of the 
			moon, howl the dog and the wolf, 
			and creeping things crawl out
			of the slime.  It is then the 
			ghouls feast in all their
			radiance.

	The Mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and Criswell  
	quickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face 
	behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent 
	elbow against his face, in Dracula fashion.

				CRISWELL (VO - Continuing)
			It is on nights like this most
			people prefer to steer clear of,
			uh, Burial Grounds. It is on 
			nights like this, that the 
			creatures are said to appear, 
			and to walk!

							    CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT, CRISWELL CLIMBING ONTO HIS THRONE
	
	Criswell walks up the steps to the altar, across the altar, 
	and then sits down on the stone seat.  He then slowly lowers 
	his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right 
	(at his cue card).	  	 

				CRISWELL
			The day is gone, the night is
			upon us, and the moon, which 
			controls all of the underworld, 
			once again shines...in radiant 
			contentment.
				(beat)
			Come forth, come forth, o
			Princess of Darkness.

	Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his 
	right hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum.

	The PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the 
	Mausoleum.  She walks into the clearing with an entrancing 
	demeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her.  
	She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open 
	sleeves.  The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a
	couple feet from her wrists.  She walks slowly over toward
	Criswell's throne.

	The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, 
	crosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward 
	him.  He nods toward her.  She reaches out and places her 
	left hand on Criswell's right hand.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			Time seems to stand still.  Not 
			so the ghouls, when a night of 
			Pleasure is at hand!

	Criswell continues to hold the Princess of Darkness's hand, 
	and she looks at him seductively.

				CRISWELL
			If I am not pleased by tonight's
			entertainment, I shall banish 
			their souls to everlasting 
			damnation!

	The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of 
	her chest and slowly bows to Criswell.

	CUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing,
	then back.
	
				CRISWELL
			And who is to be first?

	The Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of 
	the night's entertainers.  These poor souls must dance for 
	Criswell's approval.  If he is pleased, they can continue to 
	entertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished 
	to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell.

	LONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING.  Huge flames rise from the ground 
	in front of the clearing.  The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing 
	and begins to Dance.  She is wearing a red Native American-
	style dress and headband.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			One who loved flames.  Her lover
			was killed by flames.  She died 
			in flames.

	The INDIAN GIRL DANCE begins.

	The Indian Girl dances around for awhile, then dances away 
	into the foggy background.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob slowly wakes up and sits up.  Bob and Shirley look 
	around.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the 
	mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips!  A 
	marvel of filmmaking art.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS 
			    (out of sync with picture)
			One who prowls the lonely streets
			at night in life is bound to prowl 
			them in eternity.

	The STREET WALKER DANCE begins.  The STREET WALKER walks 
	into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather 
	boa, and beckons with her finger as if to say, "Come here, 
	Criswell!"

EXT. WOODS.  NIGHT.

	At the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley, slow jazz 
	music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery. 
	Bob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking 
	toward the source of the music.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			Ahh, the curiousity of youth...
			on the road to ruin!  May it 
			ever be so adventurous!
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.
				
				BOB
			Well we certainly can't stay 
			here. C'mon.	
				
				SHIRLEY
			Where?
				
				BOB
			In there.
				
				SHIRLEY
			It frightens me.
				
				BOB
			Silly, there's nothing in 
			there to be afraid of.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Then..then what's that music?
			
				BOB
			That's what I want to find out.  
			We have to get help.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help can we possibly find 
			in the cemetery at this time of 
			night?
				
				BOB
			Something's making that music.
			
				SHIRLEY
			I'm not sure I care to find out
			what it is.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Don't worry, I'll
			be right beside you.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help will that do if 
			something in there isn't dead?
				
				BOB
			Not dead?  In a cemetery?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I can't imagine anything dead 
			playing that music.
				
				BOB
			Well, it's probably just the
			caretaker, and that's exactly 
			who we want to find.  They'll 
			have a telephone.  C'mon.
				
	Bob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the 
	thick bushes.

EXT. CEMETERY, NIGHT

	Criswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval.
	The Street Walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared.

	Bob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low.  
	They reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the 
	Princess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance.
	
				SHIRLEY
			Could it be some kind of 
			college initiation?
				
				BOB
			It's an initiation all right, 
			but not of a college as you 
			and I know them.  Nothing 
			alive looks like that!
				
				SHIRLEY
			Can't we get out of here?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure...
				
				SHIRLEY
			What do you mean?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure, myself. It's 
			just a feeling I've had 
			since the crash...Like I 
			feel a cold chill all over..
			..Now this!

	The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by 
	the door of the mausoleum.

	The Street Walker dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			I would see for approval, the
			one who in life worshipped 
			gold above all else.

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
	mausoleum again to start off the next dance.

	The giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white
	horizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb?). 
	They pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the GOLD 
	GIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside.

				SHIRLEY
		       (pointing toward the mausoleum)
			Look!
			
				BOB
			Be careful!--They'll see you.

	The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the 
	table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing.  She is 
	wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress.

	We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the 
	Gold Girl's dress has disappeared.

	The Gold Girl Dance continues.

				CRISWELL
			Throw gold at her.
				
	The giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin 
	slowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances. 
	She sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins.


				CRISWELL
			More gold.
				
	The giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl.  
	She picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, 
	in ecstasy.

				CRISWELL
			       (excitedly)
			More gold!

	The giants continue, to the delight of Criswell.  The Gold 
	girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.
	
				CRISWELL
			      (impatiently)
			More gold!

	The giants continue.  Criswell is thrilled, and begins to 
	LAUGH loudly.
	
				CRISWELL
			    (to the Princess)
			For all eternity, she shall 
			have gold.

	The Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then 
	claps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the
	ceremony.
	
	The Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the 
	ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her 
	body.  The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying 
	to maintain contact with the gold.  She reaches for it as 
	they lift her up.
	
	CLOSEUP of a BUBBLING GIANT CAULDRON full of a substance that 
	is supposed to look like gold.
	
	The Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron,
	submerging her entire body.
	
	A few seconds later, the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the 
	cauldron.  Her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff. 
	They lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, 
	walking in front of Criswell's throne, then back into the 
	mausoleum, laying her body on the altar.
	
	We see Bob and Shirley, looking dismayed.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			And both couldn't help but 
			remember a line from one of 
			Bob's stories:  "A sudden wind 
			howls.  The night things are 
			all about me.  Every shadow, a
			beckoning invitation...to 
			disaster.  I know I should 
			think of other things, of 
			pleasant things, but I can't. 
			How can I think of other things, 
			of pleasant things, when I am 
			in a place surrounded by 
			shadows and objects, which can 
			take any shape, here in the 
			darkness...Any shape my mind 
			can conceive."

	Deep in the woods, we see THE WOLF MAN and THE MUMMY, walking 
	quickly.

	Suddenly, Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the WOLF 
	MAN and the MUMMY.  The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and 
	Shirley over to the clearing near Criswell's throne.
	
	The Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswell's right 
	side with him on his throne.
	
				CRISWELL
			Bring 'em in!

	The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the 
	altar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at 
	the end of the altar and crosses her legs.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the 
	center of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of 
	the Dark World.
	
				CRISWELL
			They are live ones?
				
				THE MUMMY
		    (with audible tape hiss added)
			Yes, Master.
			
				CRISWELL
			Live ones where only the dead 
			should be?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Yes, Master, and we caught 
			them, him and me.
				
	The Mummy motions toward the Wolf Man.

				THE WOLF MAN
			WWWWOOOOOOAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHAHAAAA!!!

				CRISWELL
			You shall both be rewarded.
			      (To Princess)
			My Dear Empress of the Night, 
			put these intruders to the 
			test.
	
	Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness.  (Suddenly the Princess 
	of  Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the 
	seat at the foot of the altar)
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			But they are not yet one of us.
				
				CRISWELL
			        (happily)
			A situation easily remedied.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Tie them that they may watch.

	CUT back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar. 
	The Princess of	Darkness is now seated again at the end of 
	the altar.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy tie Bob and Shirley to very tall 
	grave stones.
	
	CUT to medium-close shot of Princess of Darkness, whose chest 
	is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long 
	sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her waist.
	
				SHIRLEY
			  (desperately, to Criswell)
			Fiend!  Fiend!
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			To love the cat, is to be 
			the cat!
	
	Criswell motions toward The Princess of Darkness, who then 
	walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside 
	Criswell again.
		
	The CAT GIRL DANCE begins.

	
	
				CRISWELL
			      (jovially)
			A pussycat is born to be 
			whipped.

	The Cat Girl Dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			It will please me very much 
			to see the Slave Girl with 
			her tortures!

	CUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum.  The Ancient Egyptian 
	SLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the 
	wall.  One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat 
	o' nine tails.

	CUT back to CRISWELL.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			Torture! Torture!  It 
			pleasures me!

	The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains 
	suddenly pop off the hook.  She then pushes the iron doors 
	open and dances out into the clearing.

	The Slave Dance concludes.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.

				BOB
			You've got a right to be.  
			We're trapped by a bunch of 
			fiends.

				SHIRLEY
			Those creatures..!

				BOB
			Don't let them hear you.

				SHIRLEY
			What can we do?

				BOB
			I don't know.  I just don't 
			know. But don't give up.  
			We're not finished yet.

	Shirley closes her eyes and sighs.

				BOB
			Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic 
			won't do us any good!  Let 
			me think. We've got to
			stall for time.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm afraid I'll faint.

				BOB
			Whatever you do, don't do 
			that.

	The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The
	Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley.  The Wolf Man has 
	his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley 
	are saying.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's 
	throne.

	The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while
	The Mummy and Criswell watch.

	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over 
	to Shirley.  Shirley grimaces.  The Princess of Darkness 
	unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with 
	a red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail.

	Shirley screams.

	The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt
	and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes.  Suddenly, Criswell
	yells:

				CRISWELL
			HOLD!

	The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Let her continue to learn.  
			The time is not yet right 
			that they should join with 
			us.

	The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in 
	her belt and tucks Shirley's blouse back in.

	The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswell's throne.  
	He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat.

				CRISWELL
			...And what is this?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			A symbol, Master.

				CRISWELL
			What kind of symbol?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She loved the bull ring 
			and the matador.  She 
			danced to their destruction.
			Now she dances to her own 
			destruction.  Her dance is
			of skulls.

	The Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and 
	throws it dramatically into the clearing.

	The MEXICAN DANCE (SKULL DANCE) ensues.

				CRISWELL
			She came to us on the Day of 
			the Dead.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			El Dia De Los Muertos...A
			celebration in her country.

				CRISWELL				
			Her dance has pleased me.

	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers, starting the 
	HAWAIIAN DANCE (SNAKE DANCE).

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			With the loss of her lover, 
			this one cast herself into 
			the Volcano's fire.

	A couple times during the dance, there are abrupt cuts to 
	STOCK FOOTAGE of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in 
	tall dry grass.  (Looks like it was from a documentary)

				CRISWELL
			She was?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As I said, a worshipper of 
			snakes, and of smoke, and 
			flames.

				CRISWELL
			Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master.

	Hawaiian Dance continues, then cut to The Mummy and The Wolf 
	Man.
	
				THE MUMMY
			I don't like snakes.  I remember 
			the one Cleopatra used.  Cute 
			little rascal until it flicked
			out that red tongue, and those 
			two sharp fangs.  You'd never 
			think such a little thing
			packed such a big wallop.
					
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
					
				THE MUMMY
			Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			       (in agreement)
			Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.	

	Hawaiian/Snake Girl continues to dance.
	
				THE MUMMY
			We had lots of snakes in my 
			ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky
			things.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn.
			AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
				
				THE MUMMY
			When I was alive, they were the
			things nightmares were made of.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaarrrgggaahh.
	
	The Hawaiian Dance ends.
				
				CRISWELL
			She pleases me.  Permit her to 
			live in the World of the Snakes.
			   (audible cue card flip)
		
				CRISWELL
	(continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card)
			Now, I will talk...to The 
			Wolf Man...and The Mummy.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As you wish, Master

	The Princess of Darkness motions for The Wolf Man and The Mummy 
	to come.
				
				THE MUMMY	
			He wants us.
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
				
				THE MUMMY
			What do you suppose for?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Did you do something to get 
			us into trouble again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.
			
				THE MUMMY
			Did you howl off-key at 
			the moon again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.

				THE MUMMY
			I can't remember doing 
			anything wrong either.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			COME!
				
				THE MUMMY
			We better go before we 
			make him mad.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne.

				THE MUMMY
			      (apprehensively)
			We are your servants, Master.

	The Wolf Man bows to Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Of course you are.

	The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face Criswell.

				THE MUMMY
			Have we in some way made 
			you angry, Master?

				CRISWELL
			You know better than that.

				THE MUMMY
			We don't know of anything, 
			Master...

				CRISWELL
			Then why do you shake so?

				THE MUMMY
			It's not often an Emperor 
			like you calls on creatures 
			like us.

				CRISWELL
			Well rest easy, I'm not 
			angry with either of you.

				THE MUMMY
				(relieved)
			Aaaahhhh.

	The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods.

				THE MUMMY
			Then it is some service you 
			desire of us.

				CRISWELL
			You are the keepers of the 
			Damned.  You two know them all.  
			And I am tired of this usual 
			type of entertainment.
			I want...a decided change.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon!...is soon gone!
			
	The Princess of Darkness points up at the full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There is little time left for 
			the remainder of the evening's 
			pleasures.
			
	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the seat at the end of 
	the altar and walks around beside Criswell's throne.

				CRISWELL
			Yes, yes yes I know all that.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning sun's rays, we must 
			be gone.

				CRISWELL
			I suppose most of the others 
			will have to wait for their 
			judgement until after the next 
			full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, but I declare there is 
			still time for something.

				THE MUMMY
			There are one or two which 
			should complement the night's 
			entertainment, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, good.  Then I will 
			see them.  Dismiss the rest.

				THE MUMMY
			Yes, sir, Master.

	Bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding 
	his wrists behind his back around the stone column.
	
				BOB
			The ropes are coming loose.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful!
				
				BOB
			I am--It's our only chance.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Nothing is worth your life.
				
				BOB
			My guess is if we don't 
			take the chance pretty soon,
			we're not going to have much
			life left anyway.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm frightened.  I'm so 
			frightened.
				
				BOB
			Hold on just a little 
			longer, Shirley.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful, oh please be 
			careful.  We'll never get 
			out of here alive, I know 
			it.  I just feel it.
				
				BOB
			You do?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes I feel it in my bones.
			
				BOB
			You're talking nonsense.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Oh, no I'm not.  These 
			heathens probably have 
			an open grave for us.
			
				BOB
			They wouldn't dare put 
			us in the same grave--
			or would they?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I should hope not.  I 
			hate you!
			
				BOB
			That sudden?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't
			for you we wouldn't be hunting 
			for an old cemetery on a 
			night like this.  It's all
			your fault.
			
				BOB
			     (dejected)
			...And I thought you loved me.
			
				
	The Princess of Darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth 
	and whispering into Criswell's ear, looking over her hand back 
	at Shirley.
				
				CRISWELL
			Not yet.  I perhaps have other 
			plans for such a pretty one.  
			No matter, I will tell you when 
			and if you may have her.

	The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to 
	Criswell.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The Wolf Man informs me that 
			the next one is the woman who 
			murdered her husband on their 
			wedding night.  Now she dances
			with his skeleton.
			
	The SKELETON DANCE begins.

	The SKELETON DANCE GIRL, wearing a white dress and long 
	wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton.  She 
	dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for 
	Criswell.

	The Skeleton Dance concludes.
				
				CRISWELL
			      (to Shirley)
			Have you not enjoyed the 
			evening's festivities?
				
	Shirley is silent and looks downward.
	
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, that will soon change 
			when you become one of us!

	The Wolf Man leans back and howls.  (He tilts his head back so
	far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his 
	skin at the bottom of his neck)
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			WWAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAHHGGGGHHHAAAA-
			AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh!
				
				CRISWELL
			It would seem that The 
			Wolf Man would have you 
			for his own!
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			I have promised both The 
			Wolf Man and The Mummy a 
			reward.  It could be that
			you are that reward.
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			You need not worry...Not just 
			now, anyway.
				
				BOB
			Leave her alone, you fiend!
			
				CRISWELL
			Fiend is it!  You will not 
			be so fortunate.  Your 
			existence will cease within 
			moments.  No one wishes to 
			see a man dance...
			   (looking at Shirley)
			And you, my dear, will entertain 
			for centuries to come.
			
				BOB
			If I could get my hands on 
			you...
			
				CRISWELL
			..Oh, You could do nothing!
			    (to Shirley)
			I can save you much pain.
			
				BOB
			Leave her alone, I tell you!
			
				CRISWELL
			    (to Shirley)
			I do not joke in my proposal.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She is to be mine!  It is so
			spoken!
			
				CRISWELL
			The Princess of Darkness would 
			have you for her own to join us 
			through extreme pain.
			      (beat)
			Yet I am inclined for one as 
			lovely as you, to be more lenient. 
			I have but to touch you with my 
			finger, and it would mean the end 
			of you, all over, quickly and 
			painlessly...
			
				SHIRLEY
			No. No! No!
			
				CRISWELL
			I repulse you?  Very well.  It
			seems you have chosen your own 
			fate. Live with it!  I should 
			say die with it!

	Bob looks down somberly, then looks over at Shirley.

				BOB
			I've got the ropes loose now.  
			I've got my hands free.  Be 
			careful--Don't change your 
			expression too much.  They 
			must not catch on.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What can we do against them?
			
				BOB
			I don't know, yet.  We'll 
			just have to watch our chance.  
			When it comes I'll know what 
			to do--I hope I'll know what
			to do.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I still don't know what ever
			made me go steady with a 
			crackpot writer like you.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Put it on heavy.
			
				SHIRLEY
			My old boyfriend Tommy would 
			never have gotten me in a 
			mess like this.  At least he's 
			got brains.
			
				BOB
			Him!  I'll bet he sleeps 
			with all the lights on.

				SHIRLEY
			Maybe so.

	CUT TO shot of The Mummy talking to The Wolf Man

				THE MUMMY
			I could make her another 
			Cleopatra...

				THE WOLF MAN
			Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!

				THE MUMMY
			Without the snake, of 
			course.		

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			Well?

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, she will be yours.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			When!?
	
				CRISWELL
			At your discretion...But 
			first, I desire more 
			entertainment.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, there is yet time.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning's rays' light...
				
				CRISWELL
			   (getting annoyed)
			I know the laws of the night.  
			I state there is still time 
			for yet another.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(forcefully)
			I would have time for my 
			own pleasures!
			
				CRISWELL
				(angrily)
			Your own pleasure comes only 
			after mine, when I desire it.  
			I am the Sole Ruler of the 
			Dark World.  There is no one 
			to challenge my authority here.  
			My word is the law--all powerful.  
			No one is to challenge that 
			authority, no one!.  Is that 
			understood?  It is my command.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			I understand, Master
			
				CRISWELL
			Then see that it does not 
			happen again, in the penalty of 
			Everlasting Despair.  Now are 
			there others?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There are others.
				
				CRISWELL
			Well then let us proceed.
				
	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers three times, 
	summoning the Zombie Dance Girl.
	
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She lived as a zombie in life, 
			so she will remain forever a 
			zombie in death.

	The ZOMBIE DANCE GIRL dances.
			
				BOB
			Easy, Shirley.  Easy!

	The Zombie Dance concludes.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon sinks lower into the 
			hills!  We must hurry to the 
			finish.
			
				CRISWELL
			I will decide the conclusion.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			You had the mummy cancel all 
			the others scheduled for this 
			session.
				
				CRISWELL
				(interrupting)
			Then cancel my order.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			There is yet time.  Don't 
			you want your own pleasure?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Oh, if there is only time!
				
				CRISWELL
			Hahh, there is always time...
			All in good time...there is 
			always time.  You shall 
			have your pleasure.  THAT...
			I decree
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(looking at Shirley)
			All others were but infinitessimal 
			bits of fluff, compared to her
				(toward the Dancer)
			This one would have died for
			feathers, furs, and fluff...and 
			so she did!

	The FLUFF DANCE Girl dances for approval.
	
	The Fluff Dance ends.
	
	Criswell looks over at the Princess of Darkness.
				CRISWELL
			The time...is short.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			For what!?!
				
				CRISWELL
			Your pleasures of course!
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			You mean...!
				
				CRISWELL
			You may take her now.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Is there time?
				
				CRISWELL
			You better hope there is.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Thank you, Master!  Thank 
			you.
				
				CRISWELL
			Now hurry, hurry.  I will 
			watch!  Your desires may be 
			my pleasure also...Our fitting 
			climax to an evening's enter-
			tainment.  You must...hurry 
			now.
			
	The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with 
	her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, 
	gazing back at Criswell seductively.  She finally gets to 
	Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which 
	was so tight it was about to burst open anyway.  She unsnaps 
	the front of Shirley's bra.
	
	Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely
	stepping forward.  He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back 
	of the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.
	
	The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above 
	Shirley's head.  But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already 
	high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power.  The 
	Princess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly 
	sinks down to the ground, losing all strength.
	
	The Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then 
	back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming 
	skeletons.  Only their clothing and bones remain.
	
	Quick Zoom in on Criswell's throne.  Criswell's steaming 
	skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.

							FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN.

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

	At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and 
	Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they 
	were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the 
	strange music that led them to the ghouls.

	There are two DOCTORS examining Bob and Shirley.

	In the foreground, we see a REPORTER's shoulder and hands.  
	He is writing down details of the accident in a small paper 
	pad.

				DOCTOR #1
			Easy, Miss, everything's 
			gonna be alright.

				SHIRLEY
			Bob?  Bob?

				DOCTOR #1
			He's right here beside you. 
			He'll be alright too.

	The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and 
	DOCTOR #1, and continues writing in his pad.

	A Newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER crouches in the foreground to get a 
	shot of the accident scene and victims.

				SHIRLEY
			Where are they, where did 
			they go? They tried to kill 
			me.

				DOCTOR #2
			What's this you say?  Who 
			was going to kill you?

				SHIRLEY
			The ghouls--they all turned 
			into skeletons.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			Take it easy, Miss.
			
				DOCTOR #1
			What she needs is a good
			rest.

				SHIRLEY
			It's true, I tell you, it's 
			true!  They all turned into 
			skeletons.  She-she cut me 
			here.
	
	Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness 
	had made the X with her fingernail.
	
	NURSE crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, 
	then hands it to the doctor.  She cuts another piece of
	tape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her
	hanging...
			
				DOCTOR #1
			Probably was bruised in the 
			crash.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			You know, you two were very 
			lucky.

				SHIRLEY
			I love you Bob. I really do.  
			Forgive me?

				BOB
			There's nothing to forgive. 
			It was all a dream.

				SHIRLEY
			You love me then?

				BOB
			Of course I do.

	The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer 
	takes more pictures.  They put her into the back of an 
	ambulance.

	Then after the doctor listens to Bob's neck with a stethoscope, 
	Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			As it is with all the Night 
			People, they are destroyed 
			by the first rays of the sun. 
			But upon the first appearance
			of the deep shadows of the 
			night, and when the moon is 
			full, they will return, to 
			rejoice...in their evil lust, 
			and take back with them any 
			mortal who might happen along.
							CUT TO:

INT. MAUSOLEUM, MORNING.

	Criswell is back in his coffin, sitting upright.
	
				CRISWELL
			Yes, they were lucky, those two 
			young people...May you be so 
			lucky...But do not trust to 
			luck, at the full of the moon, 
			when the night is dark...Make 
			a wide path around the unholy 
			grounds...of the Night People.
			Who can say that we do not
			exist-Can you?
			
			But now, we return to our 
			graves, and you
			  (pointing at audience) 
			may join us soon!
			
	Criswell reclines back into his coffin, crossing his arms, and 
	returning to the slumber of the undead.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT.

	CLOSEUP of HEAVY RIVETED IRON DOORS with round handles
	covered by spider webs.

	Two "GIANTS", wearing leopard-skin shorts, iron bicep-bands and
	headbands, pull the heavy iron doors open revealing the
	INTERIOR of the MAUSOLEUM.  There is an ornate stone sarcophagus
	in the center of the room, raised up on an altar.  The back wall
	has a mantle with a bust of the Virgin Mary looking downward at
	the coffin.  There is a round red window in the center of the 
	wall.  A ray of red light shines through the window, 
	illuminating the misty fog hanging in the air.

	The giants walk into the Mausoleum.  They lift the heavy stone
	lid off of the coffin, revealing CRISWELL.  He is lying in the
	coffin on his back, with his arms crossed over his chest and 
	eyes closed.  He is wearing black suit pants, a white shirt, a
	black ribbon-like bow-tie, and a black satin cape.

	MEDIUM SHOT OF CRISWELL

	We see CRISWELL, Narrator of our tale and SOLE RULER OF THE 
	DARK WORLD, now sitting upright, slouching somewhat in his 
	coffin, glancing offscreen (at his cue card).

	During his monologue, each time Criswell looks up at the camera 
	a DRAMATIC PAUSE is inserted as he then looks back down at the
	cue card and searches for his place in order to continue.


	 			CRISWELL
			I am Criswell!  For years I have 
			told the almost unbelievable,

			Now I tell a tale of the

							FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN.

EXT. HIGHWAY IN WILDERNESS.  "NIGHT"

	A CONVERTIBLE is driving along a DESERT ROAD.  LONG SHOTS of
	the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight.  The
	desert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only
	a slight darkening to suggest day-for-night, but the car's
	headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch
	black in the dead of night.
							CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT - BOB AND SHIRLEY IN CAR.  NIGHT

	BOB and SHIRLEY are seated in the CONVERTIBLE, driving through
	the night, on a "date".  They are searching for an ancient
	CEMETERY.  MEDIUM SHOTS have a pitch black background and dark
	shadows across the car.

	Shirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob, who is
	driving.
	 
	   			SHIRLEY
 		  	We sure picked the wrong night
			to find a cemetery.  Let's turn
			back.
			
				BOB
			No.  It's on a night like this
			when the best ideas come to mind.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But does it have to be in a
			cemetery?

				BOB
			You wouldn't understand.  Seeing
			a cemetery on a night like this
			can stir in the mind the best
			ideas for a good horror story.

	   			SHIRLEY
			But there're so many wonderful
			things to write about, Bob.

				BOB
			Sure there are--and I've tried
			them all.  Plays, love stories,
			westerns, dog stories.  Huh, 
			now there was a good one, that 
			dog story all about--

	   			SHIRLEY
			    (interrupting)
			But horror stories!  Why all the
			time horror stories?

				BOB
			Shirley, I wrote for years 
			without selling a single word.

	Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around 
	Shirley, who leans closer against him.

				BOB
			My monsters have done well for 
			me.  You think I'd give that up 
			just so I could write about 
			trees, or dogs, or daisies?  
			Huhuh--Daisies!  That's it, 
			I'll write about my creatures 
			who are pushing up the daisies.

	Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles.  He tilts his head down and 
	they kiss.
 		   		BOB
			Your puritan upbringing holds
			you back from my monsters, but
			it certainly doesn't hurt your
			art of kissing.
				
				SHIRLEY
			That's life.  My kisses are
			alive.
			
				BOB
			Who's to say my monsters 
			aren't alive?		   			

	LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road

	CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley

				BOB
			All of my books are based on 
			fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps 
			why they're more interesting 
			and sell in the top spots.

				SHIRLEY
			Well, fact or not, I don't 
			see how we're going to find 
			an ancient cemetery in these 
			mountains tonight.  I can't 
			see a thing!  Let's turn back.

				BOB
			There's an old cemetery on
			this road. I've been there 
			before.

	LONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy
	mountain in the background.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm getting the jitters!  
			Let's turn back!

				BOB
			   (reluctantly)
			Okay.

	Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the 
	wheel.

				BOB
			Just as soon as I find a 
			place wide enough to turn 
			around.

	CLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			Not so fast!

	We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road.

	CLOSEUP of car wheel racing along the road.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

				SHIRLEY
			    (desperately)
			Not so fast!

	CLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS.  Bob steps hard on the brake,
	then pumps the brake repeatedly.

	CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley.  Shirley screams
	and hides her face with her hands.

	ZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen
	swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile 
	crash.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious,
	on the ground.  The ground is covered by scattered leaves.  
	Misty fog swirls over them.
				(beat)
	Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily.  She looks 
	around, then looks down at Bob.  She moves toward him and
	cradles his head in her lap.
							DISSOLVE TO:
	
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Cemetery is filled with fog.  We see a large stone throne
	framed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it.  There 
	are tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on 
	the ground.

	CAMERA PANS RIGHT across a small clearing to the MAUSOLEUM.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			It is said on clear nights, 
			beneath	the cold light of the 
			moon, howl the dog and the wolf, 
			and creeping things crawl out
			of the slime.  It is then the 
			ghouls feast in all their
			radiance.

	The Mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and Criswell  
	quickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face 
	behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent 
	elbow against his face, in Dracula fashion.

				CRISWELL (VO - Continuing)
			It is on nights like this most
			people prefer to steer clear of,
			uh, Burial Grounds. It is on 
			nights like this, that the 
			creatures are said to appear, 
			and to walk!

							    CUT TO:

	MEDIUM SHOT, CRISWELL CLIMBING ONTO HIS THRONE
	
	Criswell walks up the steps to the altar, across the altar, 
	and then sits down on the stone seat.  He then slowly lowers 
	his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right 
	(at his cue card).	  	 

				CRISWELL
			The day is gone, the night is
			upon us, and the moon, which 
			controls all of the underworld, 
			once again shines...in radiant 
			contentment.
				(beat)
			Come forth, come forth, o
			Princess of Darkness.

	Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his 
	right hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum.

	The PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the 
	Mausoleum.  She walks into the clearing with an entrancing 
	demeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her.  
	She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open 
	sleeves.  The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a
	couple feet from her wrists.  She walks slowly over toward
	Criswell's throne.

	The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, 
	crosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward 
	him.  He nods toward her.  She reaches out and places her 
	left hand on Criswell's right hand.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			Time seems to stand still.  Not 
			so the ghouls, when a night of 
			Pleasure is at hand!

	Criswell continues to hold the Princess of Darkness's hand, 
	and she looks at him seductively.

				CRISWELL
			If I am not pleased by tonight's
			entertainment, I shall banish 
			their souls to everlasting 
			damnation!

	The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of 
	her chest and slowly bows to Criswell.

	CUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing,
	then back.
	
				CRISWELL
			And who is to be first?

	The Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of 
	the night's entertainers.  These poor souls must dance for 
	Criswell's approval.  If he is pleased, they can continue to 
	entertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished 
	to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell.

	LONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING.  Huge flames rise from the ground 
	in front of the clearing.  The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing 
	and begins to Dance.  She is wearing a red Native American-
	style dress and headband.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			One who loved flames.  Her lover
			was killed by flames.  She died 
			in flames.

	The INDIAN GIRL DANCE begins.

	The Indian Girl dances around for awhile, then dances away 
	into the foggy background.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Bob slowly wakes up and sits up.  Bob and Shirley look 
	around.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the 
	mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips!  A 
	marvel of filmmaking art.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS 
			    (out of sync with picture)
			One who prowls the lonely streets
			at night in life is bound to prowl 
			them in eternity.

	The STREET WALKER DANCE begins.  The STREET WALKER walks 
	into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather 
	boa, and beckons with her finger as if to say, "Come here, 
	Criswell!"

EXT. WOODS.  NIGHT.

	At the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley, slow jazz 
	music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery. 
	Bob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking 
	toward the source of the music.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			Ahh, the curiousity of youth...
			on the road to ruin!  May it 
			ever be so adventurous!
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.
				
				BOB
			Well we certainly can't stay 
			here. C'mon.	
				
				SHIRLEY
			Where?
				
				BOB
			In there.
				
				SHIRLEY
			It frightens me.
				
				BOB
			Silly, there's nothing in 
			there to be afraid of.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Then..then what's that music?
			
				BOB
			That's what I want to find out.  
			We have to get help.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help can we possibly find 
			in the cemetery at this time of 
			night?
				
				BOB
			Something's making that music.
			
				SHIRLEY
			I'm not sure I care to find out
			what it is.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Don't worry, I'll
			be right beside you.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What help will that do if 
			something in there isn't dead?
				
				BOB
			Not dead?  In a cemetery?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I can't imagine anything dead 
			playing that music.
				
				BOB
			Well, it's probably just the
			caretaker, and that's exactly 
			who we want to find.  They'll 
			have a telephone.  C'mon.
				
	Bob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the 
	thick bushes.

EXT. CEMETERY, NIGHT

	Criswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval.
	The Street Walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared.

	Bob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low.  
	They reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the 
	Princess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance.
	
				SHIRLEY
			Could it be some kind of 
			college initiation?
				
				BOB
			It's an initiation all right, 
			but not of a college as you 
			and I know them.  Nothing 
			alive looks like that!
				
				SHIRLEY
			Can't we get out of here?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure...
				
				SHIRLEY
			What do you mean?
				
				BOB
			I'm not sure, myself. It's 
			just a feeling I've had 
			since the crash...Like I 
			feel a cold chill all over..
			..Now this!

	The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by 
	the door of the mausoleum.

	The Street Walker dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			I would see for approval, the
			one who in life worshipped 
			gold above all else.

	The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
	mausoleum again to start off the next dance.

	The giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white
	horizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb?). 
	They pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the GOLD 
	GIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside.

				SHIRLEY
		       (pointing toward the mausoleum)
			Look!
			
				BOB
			Be careful!--They'll see you.

	The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the 
	table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing.  She is 
	wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress.

	We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the 
	Gold Girl's dress has disappeared.

	The Gold Girl Dance continues.

				CRISWELL
			Throw gold at her.
				
	The giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin 
	slowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances. 
	She sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins.


				CRISWELL
			More gold.
				
	The giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl.  
	She picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, 
	in ecstasy.

				CRISWELL
			       (excitedly)
			More gold!

	The giants continue, to the delight of Criswell.  The Gold 
	girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.
	
				CRISWELL
			      (impatiently)
			More gold!

	The giants continue.  Criswell is thrilled, and begins to 
	LAUGH loudly.
	
				CRISWELL
			    (to the Princess)
			For all eternity, she shall 
			have gold.

	The Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then 
	claps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the
	ceremony.
	
	The Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the 
	ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her 
	body.  The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying 
	to maintain contact with the gold.  She reaches for it as 
	they lift her up.
	
	CLOSEUP of a BUBBLING GIANT CAULDRON full of a substance that 
	is supposed to look like gold.
	
	The Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron,
	submerging her entire body.
	
	A few seconds later, the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the 
	cauldron.  Her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff. 
	They lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, 
	walking in front of Criswell's throne, then back into the 
	mausoleum, laying her body on the altar.
	
	We see Bob and Shirley, looking dismayed.
	
				CRISWELL (VO)
			And both couldn't help but 
			remember a line from one of 
			Bob's stories:  "A sudden wind 
			howls.  The night things are 
			all about me.  Every shadow, a
			beckoning invitation...to 
			disaster.  I know I should 
			think of other things, of 
			pleasant things, but I can't. 
			How can I think of other things, 
			of pleasant things, when I am 
			in a place surrounded by 
			shadows and objects, which can 
			take any shape, here in the 
			darkness...Any shape my mind 
			can conceive."

	Deep in the woods, we see THE WOLF MAN and THE MUMMY, walking 
	quickly.

	Suddenly, Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the WOLF 
	MAN and the MUMMY.  The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and 
	Shirley over to the clearing near Criswell's throne.
	
	The Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswell's right 
	side with him on his throne.
	
				CRISWELL
			Bring 'em in!

	The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the 
	altar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at 
	the end of the altar and crosses her legs.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the 
	center of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of 
	the Dark World.
	
				CRISWELL
			They are live ones?
				
				THE MUMMY
		    (with audible tape hiss added)
			Yes, Master.
			
				CRISWELL
			Live ones where only the dead 
			should be?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Yes, Master, and we caught 
			them, him and me.
				
	The Mummy motions toward the Wolf Man.

				THE WOLF MAN
			WWWWOOOOOOAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHAHAAAA!!!

				CRISWELL
			You shall both be rewarded.
			      (To Princess)
			My Dear Empress of the Night, 
			put these intruders to the 
			test.
	
	Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness.  (Suddenly the Princess 
	of  Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the 
	seat at the foot of the altar)
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			But they are not yet one of us.
				
				CRISWELL
			        (happily)
			A situation easily remedied.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Tie them that they may watch.

	CUT back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar. 
	The Princess of	Darkness is now seated again at the end of 
	the altar.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy tie Bob and Shirley to very tall 
	grave stones.
	
	CUT to medium-close shot of Princess of Darkness, whose chest 
	is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long 
	sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her waist.
	
				SHIRLEY
			  (desperately, to Criswell)
			Fiend!  Fiend!
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			To love the cat, is to be 
			the cat!
	
	Criswell motions toward The Princess of Darkness, who then 
	walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside 
	Criswell again.
		
	The CAT GIRL DANCE begins.

	
	
				CRISWELL
			      (jovially)
			A pussycat is born to be 
			whipped.

	The Cat Girl Dance ends.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			It will please me very much 
			to see the Slave Girl with 
			her tortures!

	CUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum.  The Ancient Egyptian 
	SLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the 
	wall.  One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat 
	o' nine tails.

	CUT back to CRISWELL.

				CRISWELL
			      (excitedly)
			Torture! Torture!  It 
			pleasures me!

	The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains 
	suddenly pop off the hook.  She then pushes the iron doors 
	open and dances out into the clearing.

	The Slave Dance concludes.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm so frightened.

				BOB
			You've got a right to be.  
			We're trapped by a bunch of 
			fiends.

				SHIRLEY
			Those creatures..!

				BOB
			Don't let them hear you.

				SHIRLEY
			What can we do?

				BOB
			I don't know.  I just don't 
			know. But don't give up.  
			We're not finished yet.

	Shirley closes her eyes and sighs.

				BOB
			Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic 
			won't do us any good!  Let 
			me think. We've got to
			stall for time.

				SHIRLEY
			I'm afraid I'll faint.

				BOB
			Whatever you do, don't do 
			that.

	The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The
	Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley.  The Wolf Man has 
	his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley 
	are saying.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's 
	throne.

	The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while
	The Mummy and Criswell watch.

	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over 
	to Shirley.  Shirley grimaces.  The Princess of Darkness 
	unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with 
	a red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail.

	Shirley screams.

	The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt
	and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes.  Suddenly, Criswell
	yells:

				CRISWELL
			HOLD!

	The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Let her continue to learn.  
			The time is not yet right 
			that they should join with 
			us.

	The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in 
	her belt and tucks Shirley's blouse back in.

	The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswell's throne.  
	He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat.

				CRISWELL
			...And what is this?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			A symbol, Master.

				CRISWELL
			What kind of symbol?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She loved the bull ring 
			and the matador.  She 
			danced to their destruction.
			Now she dances to her own 
			destruction.  Her dance is
			of skulls.

	The Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and 
	throws it dramatically into the clearing.

	The MEXICAN DANCE (SKULL DANCE) ensues.

				CRISWELL
			She came to us on the Day of 
			the Dead.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			El Dia De Los Muertos...A
			celebration in her country.

				CRISWELL				
			Her dance has pleased me.

	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers, starting the 
	HAWAIIAN DANCE (SNAKE DANCE).

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			With the loss of her lover, 
			this one cast herself into 
			the Volcano's fire.

	A couple times during the dance, there are abrupt cuts to 
	STOCK FOOTAGE of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in 
	tall dry grass.  (Looks like it was from a documentary)

				CRISWELL
			She was?

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As I said, a worshipper of 
			snakes, and of smoke, and 
			flames.

				CRISWELL
			Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master.

	Hawaiian Dance continues, then cut to The Mummy and The Wolf 
	Man.
	
				THE MUMMY
			I don't like snakes.  I remember 
			the one Cleopatra used.  Cute 
			little rascal until it flicked
			out that red tongue, and those 
			two sharp fangs.  You'd never 
			think such a little thing
			packed such a big wallop.
					
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
					
				THE MUMMY
			Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			       (in agreement)
			Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.	

	Hawaiian/Snake Girl continues to dance.
	
				THE MUMMY
			We had lots of snakes in my 
			ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky
			things.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn.
			AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
				
				THE MUMMY
			When I was alive, they were the
			things nightmares were made of.
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaarrrgggaahh.
	
	The Hawaiian Dance ends.
				
				CRISWELL
			She pleases me.  Permit her to 
			live in the World of the Snakes.
			   (audible cue card flip)
		
				CRISWELL
	(continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card)
			Now, I will talk...to The 
			Wolf Man...and The Mummy.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			As you wish, Master

	The Princess of Darkness motions for The Wolf Man and The Mummy 
	to come.
				
				THE MUMMY	
			He wants us.
			
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
				
				THE MUMMY
			What do you suppose for?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
				
				THE MUMMY
			Did you do something to get 
			us into trouble again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.
			
				THE MUMMY
			Did you howl off-key at 
			the moon again?
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			Aannnnaahhnn.

				THE MUMMY
			I can't remember doing 
			anything wrong either.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			COME!
				
				THE MUMMY
			We better go before we 
			make him mad.

	The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne.

				THE MUMMY
			      (apprehensively)
			We are your servants, Master.

	The Wolf Man bows to Criswell.

				CRISWELL
			Of course you are.

	The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face Criswell.

				THE MUMMY
			Have we in some way made 
			you angry, Master?

				CRISWELL
			You know better than that.

				THE MUMMY
			We don't know of anything, 
			Master...

				CRISWELL
			Then why do you shake so?

				THE MUMMY
			It's not often an Emperor 
			like you calls on creatures 
			like us.

				CRISWELL
			Well rest easy, I'm not 
			angry with either of you.

				THE MUMMY
				(relieved)
			Aaaahhhh.

	The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods.

				THE MUMMY
			Then it is some service you 
			desire of us.

				CRISWELL
			You are the keepers of the 
			Damned.  You two know them all.  
			And I am tired of this usual 
			type of entertainment.
			I want...a decided change.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon!...is soon gone!
			
	The Princess of Darkness points up at the full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There is little time left for 
			the remainder of the evening's 
			pleasures.
			
	The Princess of Darkness gets up from the seat at the end of 
	the altar and walks around beside Criswell's throne.

				CRISWELL
			Yes, yes yes I know all that.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning sun's rays, we must 
			be gone.

				CRISWELL
			I suppose most of the others 
			will have to wait for their 
			judgement until after the next 
			full moon.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			It would seem so, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, but I declare there is 
			still time for something.

				THE MUMMY
			There are one or two which 
			should complement the night's 
			entertainment, Master

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, good.  Then I will 
			see them.  Dismiss the rest.

				THE MUMMY
			Yes, sir, Master.

	Bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding 
	his wrists behind his back around the stone column.
	
				BOB
			The ropes are coming loose.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful!
				
				BOB
			I am--It's our only chance.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Nothing is worth your life.
				
				BOB
			My guess is if we don't 
			take the chance pretty soon,
			we're not going to have much
			life left anyway.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I'm frightened.  I'm so 
			frightened.
				
				BOB
			Hold on just a little 
			longer, Shirley.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Be careful, oh please be 
			careful.  We'll never get 
			out of here alive, I know 
			it.  I just feel it.
				
				BOB
			You do?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes I feel it in my bones.
			
				BOB
			You're talking nonsense.
				
				SHIRLEY
			Oh, no I'm not.  These 
			heathens probably have 
			an open grave for us.
			
				BOB
			They wouldn't dare put 
			us in the same grave--
			or would they?
			
				SHIRLEY
			I should hope not.  I 
			hate you!
			
				BOB
			That sudden?
				
				SHIRLEY
			Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't
			for you we wouldn't be hunting 
			for an old cemetery on a 
			night like this.  It's all
			your fault.
			
				BOB
			     (dejected)
			...And I thought you loved me.
			
				
	The Princess of Darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth 
	and whispering into Criswell's ear, looking over her hand back 
	at Shirley.
				
				CRISWELL
			Not yet.  I perhaps have other 
			plans for such a pretty one.  
			No matter, I will tell you when 
			and if you may have her.

	The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to 
	Criswell.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The Wolf Man informs me that 
			the next one is the woman who 
			murdered her husband on their 
			wedding night.  Now she dances
			with his skeleton.
			
	The SKELETON DANCE begins.

	The SKELETON DANCE GIRL, wearing a white dress and long 
	wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton.  She 
	dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for 
	Criswell.

	The Skeleton Dance concludes.
				
				CRISWELL
			      (to Shirley)
			Have you not enjoyed the 
			evening's festivities?
				
	Shirley is silent and looks downward.
	
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, that will soon change 
			when you become one of us!

	The Wolf Man leans back and howls.  (He tilts his head back so
	far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his 
	skin at the bottom of his neck)
				
				THE WOLF MAN
			WWAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAHHGGGGHHHAAAA-
			AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh!
				
				CRISWELL
			It would seem that The 
			Wolf Man would have you 
			for his own!
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			I have promised both The 
			Wolf Man and The Mummy a 
			reward.  It could be that
			you are that reward.
			
				SHIRLEY
			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
			
				CRISWELL
			You need not worry...Not just 
			now, anyway.
				
				BOB
			Leave her alone, you fiend!
			
				CRISWELL
			Fiend is it!  You will not 
			be so fortunate.  Your 
			existence will cease within 
			moments.  No one wishes to 
			see a man dance...
			   (looking at Shirley)
			And you, my dear, will entertain 
			for centuries to come.
			
				BOB
			If I could get my hands on 
			you...
			
				CRISWELL
			..Oh, You could do nothing!
			    (to Shirley)
			I can save you much pain.
			
				BOB
			Leave her alone, I tell you!
			
				CRISWELL
			    (to Shirley)
			I do not joke in my proposal.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She is to be mine!  It is so
			spoken!
			
				CRISWELL
			The Princess of Darkness would 
			have you for her own to join us 
			through extreme pain.
			      (beat)
			Yet I am inclined for one as 
			lovely as you, to be more lenient. 
			I have but to touch you with my 
			finger, and it would mean the end 
			of you, all over, quickly and 
			painlessly...
			
				SHIRLEY
			No. No! No!
			
				CRISWELL
			I repulse you?  Very well.  It
			seems you have chosen your own 
			fate. Live with it!  I should 
			say die with it!

	Bob looks down somberly, then looks over at Shirley.

				BOB
			I've got the ropes loose now.  
			I've got my hands free.  Be 
			careful--Don't change your 
			expression too much.  They 
			must not catch on.
				
				SHIRLEY
			What can we do against them?
			
				BOB
			I don't know, yet.  We'll 
			just have to watch our chance.  
			When it comes I'll know what 
			to do--I hope I'll know what
			to do.
				
				SHIRLEY
			I still don't know what ever
			made me go steady with a 
			crackpot writer like you.
				
				BOB
			All right.  Put it on heavy.
			
				SHIRLEY
			My old boyfriend Tommy would 
			never have gotten me in a 
			mess like this.  At least he's 
			got brains.
			
				BOB
			Him!  I'll bet he sleeps 
			with all the lights on.

				SHIRLEY
			Maybe so.

	CUT TO shot of The Mummy talking to The Wolf Man

				THE MUMMY
			I could make her another 
			Cleopatra...

				THE WOLF MAN
			Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!

				THE MUMMY
			Without the snake, of 
			course.		

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			Well?

				CRISWELL
			Ahh, she will be yours.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			When!?
	
				CRISWELL
			At your discretion...But 
			first, I desire more 
			entertainment.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			Ahh, there is yet time.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			At the first sight of the 
			morning's rays' light...
				
				CRISWELL
			   (getting annoyed)
			I know the laws of the night.  
			I state there is still time 
			for yet another.

				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(forcefully)
			I would have time for my 
			own pleasures!
			
				CRISWELL
				(angrily)
			Your own pleasure comes only 
			after mine, when I desire it.  
			I am the Sole Ruler of the 
			Dark World.  There is no one 
			to challenge my authority here.  
			My word is the law--all powerful.  
			No one is to challenge that 
			authority, no one!.  Is that 
			understood?  It is my command.
			
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			I understand, Master
			
				CRISWELL
			Then see that it does not 
			happen again, in the penalty of 
			Everlasting Despair.  Now are 
			there others?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			There are others.
				
				CRISWELL
			Well then let us proceed.
				
	The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers three times, 
	summoning the Zombie Dance Girl.
	
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			She lived as a zombie in life, 
			so she will remain forever a 
			zombie in death.

	The ZOMBIE DANCE GIRL dances.
			
				BOB
			Easy, Shirley.  Easy!

	The Zombie Dance concludes.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon sinks lower into the 
			hills!  We must hurry to the 
			finish.
			
				CRISWELL
			I will decide the conclusion.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(impatiently)
			You had the mummy cancel all 
			the others scheduled for this 
			session.
				
				CRISWELL
				(interrupting)
			Then cancel my order.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			The moon is almost gone!
			
				CRISWELL
			There is yet time.  Don't 
			you want your own pleasure?
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Oh, if there is only time!
				
				CRISWELL
			Hahh, there is always time...
			All in good time...there is 
			always time.  You shall 
			have your pleasure.  THAT...
			I decree
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
				(looking at Shirley)
			All others were but infinitessimal 
			bits of fluff, compared to her
				(toward the Dancer)
			This one would have died for
			feathers, furs, and fluff...and 
			so she did!

	The FLUFF DANCE Girl dances for approval.
	
	The Fluff Dance ends.
	
	Criswell looks over at the Princess of Darkness.
				CRISWELL
			The time...is short.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			For what!?!
				
				CRISWELL
			Your pleasures of course!
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			You mean...!
				
				CRISWELL
			You may take her now.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Is there time?
				
				CRISWELL
			You better hope there is.
				
				PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
			Thank you, Master!  Thank 
			you.
				
				CRISWELL
			Now hurry, hurry.  I will 
			watch!  Your desires may be 
			my pleasure also...Our fitting 
			climax to an evening's enter-
			tainment.  You must...hurry 
			now.
			
	The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with 
	her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, 
	gazing back at Criswell seductively.  She finally gets to 
	Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which 
	was so tight it was about to burst open anyway.  She unsnaps 
	the front of Shirley's bra.
	
	Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely
	stepping forward.  He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back 
	of the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.
	
	The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above 
	Shirley's head.  But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already 
	high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power.  The 
	Princess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly 
	sinks down to the ground, losing all strength.
	
	The Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then 
	back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming 
	skeletons.  Only their clothing and bones remain.
	
	Quick Zoom in on Criswell's throne.  Criswell's steaming 
	skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.

							FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN.

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

	At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and 
	Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they 
	were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the 
	strange music that led them to the ghouls.

	There are two DOCTORS examining Bob and Shirley.

	In the foreground, we see a REPORTER's shoulder and hands.  
	He is writing down details of the accident in a small paper 
	pad.

				DOCTOR #1
			Easy, Miss, everything's 
			gonna be alright.

				SHIRLEY
			Bob?  Bob?

				DOCTOR #1
			He's right here beside you. 
			He'll be alright too.

	The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and 
	DOCTOR #1, and continues writing in his pad.

	A Newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER crouches in the foreground to get a 
	shot of the accident scene and victims.

				SHIRLEY
			Where are they, where did 
			they go? They tried to kill 
			me.

				DOCTOR #2
			What's this you say?  Who 
			was going to kill you?

				SHIRLEY
			The ghouls--they all turned 
			into skeletons.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			Take it easy, Miss.
			
				DOCTOR #1
			What she needs is a good
			rest.

				SHIRLEY
			It's true, I tell you, it's 
			true!  They all turned into 
			skeletons.  She-she cut me 
			here.
	
	Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness 
	had made the X with her fingernail.
	
	NURSE crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, 
	then hands it to the doctor.  She cuts another piece of
	tape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her
	hanging...
			
				DOCTOR #1
			Probably was bruised in the 
			crash.
			
				DOCTOR #2
			You know, you two were very 
			lucky.

				SHIRLEY
			I love you Bob. I really do.  
			Forgive me?

				BOB
			There's nothing to forgive. 
			It was all a dream.

				SHIRLEY
			You love me then?

				BOB
			Of course I do.

	The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer 
	takes more pictures.  They put her into the back of an 
	ambulance.

	Then after the doctor listens to Bob's neck with a stethoscope, 
	Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.

				CRISWELL (VO)
			As it is with all the Night 
			People, they are destroyed 
			by the first rays of the sun. 
			But upon the first appearance
			of the deep shadows of the 
			night, and when the moon is 
			full, they will return, to 
			rejoice...in their evil lust, 
			and take back with them any 
			mortal who might happen along.
							CUT TO:

INT. MAUSOLEUM, MORNING.

	Criswell is back in his coffin, sitting upright.
	
				CRISWELL
			Yes, they were lucky, those two 
			young people...May you be so 
			lucky...But do not trust to 
			luck, at the full of the moon, 
			when the night is dark...Make 
			a wide path around the unholy 
			grounds...of the Night People.
			Who can say that we do not
			exist-Can you?
			
			But now, we return to our 
			graves, and you
			  (pointing at audience) 
			may join us soon!
			
	Criswell reclines back into his coffin, crossing his arms, and 
	returning to the slumber of the undead.

                        SHOOTING SCRIPT

                         14 May 2004






 1A EXT: PROLOGUE ON BLACK - NIGHT

 The screen is black, music evoking religion and danger begins.

                                LILLY
                    For three hundred years the great plagues have
                    swept the earth. Diseases created from the
                    experiments of the Alchemists.

 We see death tolls appear through this graphically.

 The plague - 5 million souls. Virulent Small Pox - 10 million.
 Mutated Influenza 30 Million Souls...

                                Lilly
                    Thinking they had discovered Gods secret code for
                    life, the Alchemists experimented with genetic
                    science. They had no idea what they had
                    unleashed.

  We begin to see a strange medallion sweeping through smoke, slowly
  revealing itself.

                                LILLY (CONT'D)
                         (continuing)
                    ...but there was also a miracle. One of these
                    plagues helped nature create a new kind of being.
                    At first they were called Nosferatu, or Vampire
                    and were feared. But they were not supernatural
                    monsters, just a better version of ourselves.
                    They were the Brothers, and their religion and
                    science helped sustain us against the plagues and
                    influenzas that have ravaged Europe and the rest
                    of the colonies. For 300 years our two races have
                    lived in harmony. Until now...


                                          FADE UP:

2 INT: DOCTORS SURGERY - DAY                                2

 We are very close on a bespectacled eye. It stares at us and
 then looks down.

                     GENETIC DOCTOR
                  (off)
           See here. This is what you need to
           look for.

 Cut to the object in the Genetic Doctors hand; it is like an
 x-ray, yet the image looks remarkably like a DNA profile.

                     GENETIC DOCTOR
                  (continuing; off)
           A genetic mutation, we all carry
           it. But we now know a virus
           activates it.
                                                                3

We reveal the genetic Doctor, sitting at his desk, smoking a
cigarette. The surgery and the clothes suggest the year, yet
there are small things that are different, not what you'd
expect to be around at this time. Standing next to him in the
dusty haze of the room is a younger doctor; an apprentice who
looks attentive.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         This Virus plays some unknown role
         in the birth the Brothers. Of
         course the mutation occurs very
         rarely these days. And only in
         males.

The apprentice nods and then looks up. There is someone else
in the room. A woman - who we now see is pregnant. There is
something about her that suggests more a prisoner or
psychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         Strange isn't?

                    Apprentice   DOCTOR
         Strange?

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         That God would choose such humble
         vehicle for a miracle. The mothers
         invariably come from the slums, we
         don't know why.
                (to the woman)
         This is your 7th isn't it?
                                                                 4




We see the woman; she's like a hollow person, hardly aware of
where she is. The Doctor shuffles papers. Finds what he wants.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         Yes, her first was successful, a
         Brother was born. Thereafter
         variously malformed offspring. We
         can only hope this one will be
         different.
                (to woman)
         You'll have to try harder this
         time.

The woman now looks up. And tentatively speaks.

                     WOMAN IN THE SURGURY
         Please...

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         What is it?

                   WOMAN IN THE SURGURY
         Please... I want to keep my baby.
         They always take my babies away.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         Don't be stupid woman!

The woman drops her eyes. We see the Apprentice Doctor,
almost pitying the poor woman.

                   Apprentice DOCTOR
                (to woman)
         You won't have to worry. The
         Brotherhood will take him...

We are closer on the woman now. Tears begin to glisten in her
eyes as we drift closer to her.

                   Apprentice DOCTOR
                (continuing; off)
         ...raise him in the church, teach
         him. He's special. You should be
         proud. It's a blessing really,
         he'll want for nothing. Not like
         the rest of us?

We track in closer, closer, to the woman, then continue,
right into her eye, through the fluid, to see the room
reflected upside down at the back of the retina. This
dissolves to an upside view of...
                                                                  5




3 INT: HOSPITAL, OPERATION ROOM - DAY                         3

 POV, baby's view, in an operating theatre.

 Cut to

 The woman we saw earlier with the Genetic Doctor; she has
 just given birth. The baby is placed on linen blankets and
 cleaned by a nurse.

 A man now enters the operating theatre; we can tell the
 Doctor is uneasy. The man is dressed in a perfectly cut suit.
 He does not wear a surgical mask. His eyes are a piercingly
 clear light gray. He enters with two other men who look
 similar to him. By his side there is also a pristine boy;
 perhaps 8 years old, the same piercing eyes. They both
 approach the baby. The man stares serenely at the baby, all
 bloody, lying on blankets.

                     AUGUSTUS
           This is your brother Silus. You
           will teach him.

 The little boy then shares a glance with the woman who has
 just given birth. She seems to recognize the boy.

                     SILUS AS A BOY
           Is that my mother?

                     AUGUSTUS
           No, not any more.

 Augustus then leans forward and gently opens the baby's mouth.

 We see the baby close. In the otherwise baby-like mouth we
 see something strange. There are two tiny fangs protruding
 from the otherwise smooth gums.

 We see Augustus smile. In his mouth too, we see two perfectly
 pointed teeth.

                     AUGUSTUS
                  (continuing)
           Welcome to the world little
           Brother.

 We end close on the baby; its piercing eyes.

4A EXT: CITYSCAPE - NIGHT                                     4A

  We see a city, seething with smoke from coal fires, steam
  from engines, alien distorted Victorian spires are
  silhouetted against the moody, moonlit sky which is literally
  filled with dirigibles and strange flying machines that seem
  Victorian, of the industrial revolution, but that are also
  strangely futuristic. It is 1969, but not our 1969.


5 EXT: STREET - NIGHT                                         5

  A street. The look - of the film and the night - is silver,
  almost metallic moonlit skies. A hazy mist hangs in the air.
  Wet, steel pools of water on the dark footpath where a man
  stands. He stares up at a zeppelin passing overhead, its
  shadow obscuring him briefly until it passes away. Then we
  see him.

  The man is handsome, in a perfectly cut long wool jacket;
  dark gray. He wears perfectly shiny black shoes and we can
  see the surrounding street reflected in them; Victorian,
  Gothic buildings. This man is Silus. He surveys the street.
  While the houses are beautiful, they're run down.

  Silus - his eyes are the purest light gray you have ever
  seen - takes a long long inhale through his nose, his eyes
  closing briefly as if trying to sense/smell something. He
  stops the breath and opens his eyes. They are clear, full of
  purpose.

  He bends down to the footpath, runs his hand along its
  surface, almost caressing it. He closes his eyes. The camera
  moves in, to end close on Silus' ear. As this happens the
  soundtrack - all the noises in the night - become amplified.
  We see Silus' face, see him concentrating intently. We hear
  several individual noises. First a very quiet pitter patter.

  Cut to

  A cat, stealthily moving between some thorny rose bushes.

  Cut to
                                                                7




Silus again; concentrating even more. Now the distant sound
of trickling water.

Cut to

A drain pipe, leaking.

Cut to

Silus once more. This time we can hear "plop, plop, plop."

Cut to

A pool of water. Then "plop" as a drop hits it. The drop is
not water. The drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in
the water. And another drop, "plop." High speed CRANE UP from

this pool, up up the side of a building to end on a FACE in
the shadows. We can see reflective, gleaming eyes. And a
mouth, with blood dripping from it.

Cut to

Silus again. His eyes flicking open; we see the footpath
reflected in those perfect light gray eyes.

Music - brooding, ancient - begins to hum as Silus slowly
rises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so
perfect and powerful are they. A small smile has appeared on
his lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something
very dark, something very dangerous, is close by.

Slowly his hand slips into his jacket. He holds it there,
watching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for
the slightest movement. He sees it. On the wall of an old
Georgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the
wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and
brickwork. A CREATURE on the side of the wall.

Silus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect
shining silver slow motion. As he moves forward he pulls a
gun from his jacket - it is silver, organic and glass, art
nouveaux styling - and points it ahead of him as he glides
forward.

The creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards
it, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along
the side of the wall, heading away from us.

Silus fires. A bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems
almost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon
above, before hurtling at high speed towards its target.

The shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops
suddenly in the light so that we can see it.
                                                                 8



 A man. With reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple
 lips. And teeth; the teeth of a vampire. This creature
 immediately dives from the wall to the ground, just avoiding
 another two bullets that crash into the wall.

 LA as the man falls directly towards the camera.

 Silus now rushes forward, holding his gun out in front of
 him; he moves forward gracefully. He can see the man
 skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building. Silus
 tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing.
 He raises his gun towards the man once more, but he is gone.

 Close on Silus' enigmatic face. Those eyes. And in his mouth,
 two perfectly pointed fangs.

6 EXT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          6

 We are outside a cafe; the cafe is a warm glow against the
 cold night. We see past the fine falling rain - through the
 large glass window that has swirling silver art nouveaux
 designs lacing across it - to a table inside, by the window,
 where two pristinely dressed men sit.

 Cut to


7 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          7

 We are inside. Closer on the two men. One is SILUS. The other
 man is AUGUSTUS; the man we saw in the operation theatre
 before. Augustus has hardly aged at all.

                       AUGUSTUS
           The girl?

 We see Silus. He remembers.

8 INT: ROOM, FLASHBACK - NIGHT                               8

 Flashback from Silus' memory; a dead girl on a bed, blood
 splattered across her pillow.

                                                                  9




9 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                           9

 Silus' face. Pull out to reveal we're back in the café.

                      SILUS

           It is taken care of.

                     AUGUSTUS
           This is good.

                     SILUS
           Augustus. We failed this girl. We
           asked her to help us catch him,
           and then we failed her.

                     AUGUSTUS
           Yes. But her death served a
           greater good. Every trap needs
           bait.

 Augustus lifts a beautifully designed glass and silver pipe
 from the onyx table at which they sit, then settles back into
 a fine hardwood chair. The chair's swirling, delicate back
 creeks as he takes a puff on the pipe.

                     AUGUSTUS
                  (continuing)
           Are you sure you won't join me?

 Silus shakes his head, no. The opium in the pipe crackles.

                     SILUS
           Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps
           we should inform the authorities.
           The human beings.

 Augustus places the pipe down, blows a smoke ring as a
 Chinese woman, dressed in a sarong, brings over two finely
 cut crystal glasses and sets them before the men, then
 leaves. Silus now lifts the glass and we see what it
 contains. Blood; dark and red and viscous. Silus takes a sip,
 then looks over to the bar.

 There is a young woman there, sitting at the bar, being
 treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed
 patrons; the young woman laughs, enjoying the attention.
 Tubes run from the young woman's arms. These tubes carry her
 blood into a conch shaped glass bowl. We see the Chinese
 waitress fill another glass from the bowl.

 Silus watches, blood slightly present on his ashen lips. And
 we see two perfectly pointed fangs hanging in his mouth.

                     AUGUSTUS
           For now the Brothers feel we
           should deal with this ourselves.
                                                                  10




                      SILUS
            If they find out we are covering
            up these deaths...

                      AUGUSTUS
            Which is why you must find him.
            Silus.

  Silus now turns to Augustus, still looking unconvinced.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            For centuries we Brothers have
            served mankind and them us. The
            great union. But remember your
            history. 300 years ago when our
            kind were first born into this
            world they burnt our children as
            monsters. They had no notion of
            evolution. In another world we
            might all have been slaughtered,
            only to be remembered in myth,
            monsters to frighten the young or
            a puzzle for anthropologists. We
            must refuse to let one aberrant
            individual destroy the balance
            between the two races. The old
            prejudices are still there. Human
            beings are paranoid creatures by
            nature.

                      SILUS
            Perhaps they have good reason.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Silus. Simply concern yourself
            with finding Edgar. Find your
            Brother so that we can help him.
            Before he kills again.

10 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - DAY                        10

  Close up of a NEWSPAPER. On it we see a banner headline.
  "Influenza Vaccine Shortages lead to Black Market Trade." We
  pull out to reveal the paper is lying on a foot path. Wind
  blows the newspaper out of shot and we tilt up to the street.

  The street is wet, glistening. The rain, rain rain rain. The
  Edwardian and Victorian buildings of the street might seem
  beautiful, but they are not. They are largely derelict. We
  see a woman standing in a doorway out of the rain.
                                                                    11




  She is wrapped in a black plastic jacket that she pulls about
  her. A man approaches her.

                      JONES
            Everyone's ready Lilly.

                      LILLY
            About time.

  They both move to one of the tall buildings; a four story,
  ancient tenement that looks empty, almost derelict.

  They quietly move up the steps of the place and then pause.
  There is the bleep from a strange looking valve powered
  Walkie Talkie; hereafter called an RT.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            On three gents. One, two...


11 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - DAY                11

  CRASH CUT to the door of the building swinging open wildly,
  a hand held camera on the shoulder of Lilly and Jones.

  A large, grubby looking woman stands in a long, grim hallway,
  mop in hand. At the far end of the hall another door
  disconnects from its hinges and collapses inwards, two men
  appearing out of the rain.

                      JONES
                   (to the woman)
            Don't you move!

  We see a gun in Jones' hand as he moves towards the woman,
  who has her hands up and is getting down on her knees.

  The camera then pans wildly, left and right. Then Lilly's
  foot kicks in a door to our right, revealing a dank office
  and a man, half naked, reaching for a gun. A woman is lying
  on a cot and she's screaming. She is instantly recognizable
  as a prostitute.

                      LILLY
                   (to the slum landlord)
            Don't you dare.

  From this POV we see Lilly's hand pointing a gun at the SLUM
  LANDLORD, who is now slowly easing back into the scummy
  office.

                        LILLY
                     (continuing)
            Jones!
                                                                   12




  We now finally cut to see Lilly. She is around 25; an
  intelligent, handsome 25. The man Jones appears at her
  shoulder, leering. Jones is the type of guy you just know
  will go to seed at 40. But that's still 10 years away. Jones
  stares at the Slum Landlord who is trying to cover himself.

                      JONES
            God help us. What an appalling
            sight.


12 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - LATER             12

  The hallway again. The other two men we saw entering at the
  beginning are talking to the woman with the mop. One of the
  men is taking notes.

  We pan to the office, to see Lilly and Jones standing before
  the Slum Landlord, who is now wrapped in a towel and sitting
  in a chair.

                      SLUM LANDLORD
            I don't know nothing about it. I
            give 'em out. Make sure everyone
            gets 'em.

                      JONES
            That's a lie! We know you've been
            trading influenza vaccine in the
            workhouses!

  Another man now approaches Lilly.

                      FRANK
            Lil'. I think you should see this.


13 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING        13

  Halfway down the hall there is a door, Frank opens it
  displaying a set of stairs leading down.

                      FRANK
            I'd use the mask if I were you.

  Lilly pulls a dark surgical-type mask over her face, then
  slowly moves down the steps into the oblivion below.


14 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT BASEMENT - CONTINUING        14

  Cut between Lilly's POV and her face, her eyes glimmering in
  the sub-light as she moves down the stairs very carefully.
                                                                    13




  And finally the horror is revealed. In this basement there
  are 10 or 12 people, lying on the floor. Most of them are
  silent, but a couple moan. One, a woman, pleads to Lilly.

                      WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT
            Help me. Please help.

  The woman extends her arm. It is covered in sweat; grimy. The
  glands at the side of the woman's neck are distended and
  swollen, her eyes bloodshot.

                      WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT
                   (continuing)
            Please. I'm sick. Please.

  The room is a version of hell. Lilly's eyes glisten.

15 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT OFFICE - CONTINUING           15

  Jones has the Slum Landlord by the throat.

                      JONES
            You're a fucking liar!

                      SLUM LANDLORD
            No, no, I swear it, I gave 'em
            their boosters, both of 'em. I'm
            a responsible landlord, I swear to
            god. There must've been something
            wrong with them vaccines.

  Lilly stares at the Slum Landlord; shock in her face, and
  anger.

                      JONES
            This is a civil health violation!
            You're going to the hell house for
            this. You can forget lovely Doris
            here where you're going.

  We see the woman who was screaming before, the prostitute;
  she makes an obscene gesture at Jones. As this is going on
  Frank and the other man we've seen are tearing the place
  apart, looking for something. They don't find it and Frank's
  look tells Lilly so.

  Lilly's face is a mask. She is watching the Slum Landlord
  very carefully. He keeps looking down; strangely, nervously.
                                                                14




                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I don't know what you're on about.
         I've done nothing, I swear to god,
         I've done nothing.

Lilly lets her eyes drift down, all the way down to the chair
legs, which rock unevenly on the floor. Lilly is staring at
the scratched, worn floor boards which MOVE.

Cut to

Frank, prizing back the floor boards. Jones restrains the
Slum Landlord. Lilly watches. Frank pulls the floor boards
away easily. We see that hidden in the floor cavity are
packets of something. Frank pulls them out.

Rips one of the plastic bags open. In it are packets with the
words "Jamestown Borough - Civilian Influenza Vaccination."
Frank holds it up for Lilly to see.

The Slum Landlord is now looking three ways at once.

Lilly slowly begins to approach the Slum Landlord.

                   LILLY
         It is my pleasure to inform you
         that you are under arrest for
         trafficking influenza vaccine.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I want my lawyer.

                   LILLY
         This is a violation of the 12/10
         health act, whereby you have
         withheld borough sponsored
         vaccines from your tenants.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I want a lawyer!

                   LILLY
         Anything you say will be held
         against you as evidence and, by
         endangering the public good, you
         are not entitled to a lawyer.

The Slum Landlord just stares at her.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         Fuck you then.

Lilly smiles grimly.
                                                                    15




                       LILLY
             There's only one other thing.

  Lilly gives the Slum Landlord one almighty slap across the
  face that stuns him. Then Jones grabs the Slum Landlord and
  drags him off, but we stay on Lilly. Her face. She stoops and
  lifts something from the landlords desk. A public health
  flier saying "Fight Influenza. Ask your landlord for your
  free vaccine now." Then from the corner of the room, the
  prostitute pipes up, impatiently waving a cigarette at Lilly.

                       PROSTITUTE
             Oi! How about me? He promised me
             some of that. I earned it.

17 INT: POLICE CAR - TWILIGHT                                  17

  Jones is in front, Frank is driving. The car has come to a
  lurching halt. Some kind of cart is blocking the road.

                       FRANK
                    (hitting the horn)
             Come one!

  Jones is eating some kind of pie that is an affront to
  culinary art.

                       JONES
             Lil', you want some?

  Ensconced in the back Lilly shakes her head, no.

                       LILLY
             Smells terrible.

  She is watching the patterns of street lights that play and
  flow over the wet windows of the car. Jones shrugs.

                       JONES
             I'm not letting that scum put me
             off my food. That'd be like a
             moral victory.

                       LILLY
             I'll get out here.

                         FRANK
             You sure?
                                                                      16




   We see Lilly get out. Frank and Jones share a look.

                       FRANK
                    (continuing)
             What's up with her?

   Jones watches Lilly move off; something like compassion
   crosses his features.

                       FRANK
                    (continuing)
             Jones? Is she alright?

                       JONES
             Yeah. Lilly's kid. It died of the
             influenza, didn't it.

                       FRANK
             She's never said anything about a
             kid.

                       JONES
             No. She never says anything.

   Jones stares after Lilly, then starts chomping into his food.


18 EXT: SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUING                             18

   The police car pulls out leaving Lilly outside the subway
   station. Lilly looks exhausted, breathes in deeply. Above,
   power lines blow in the wind and rain and make a clacking
   sound. She moves off and we crane up to see the seething
   smoky city beyond.

20 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               20

   Lilly enters her apartment. It's nice; not opulent, but a
   haven of sorts.

   She stands for a moment in the empty hallway. We see a hall,
   several doors run off it.


20A INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, CHILDS BEDROOM - CONTINUING         20A

   Lilly approaches a room and we see inside it. It is empty
   apart from a stripped bed and some boxes.

   Lilly flips the lid on one of the boxes. She picks up a toy;
   a pink fairy princess with wings, the paint on its face worn.
                                                                    17




  Lilly winds a key and the wings of the doll flutter,
  accompanied by the whining sound of the internal mechanics.

  We see Lilly's face as she stares at the doll. Emotion fights
  to claw its way out from under her skin, but she doesn't let
  it.

  Then in the distance we hear a child's cries. It almost
  sounds like memories wafting through the air, but the
  stamping of feet from the apartment above makes it plain that
  the noises come from there; the sound of children playing.

  Cut to


21 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     21

  Lilly enters her bedroom. The place is a mess. She sits on
  the bed. She picks up a framed photo which sits on a
  sideboard next to the bed. It shows Lilly, a man - Lilly's
  age - and a child of 5 years who looks a lot like Lilly. She
  stares at the child. We hear the sound of rain pounding
  against the window of the bedroom.


22 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     22

  Pull out to reveal the exterior window. We can see through
  the window into Lilly's apartment again, see Lilly lying
  down, hugging the photo. The rain has become a light mist.


23 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - NIGHT                         23

  We are close on a poster. It shows a perfect face, serenely
  beaming out; it could be Silus or Augustus, except this man
  is dressed in religious regalia, like a priest. The poster
  says "The Brotherhood loves you. You are divine." We begin to
  crane off the poster which is revealed to be stuck on a lamp
  post. The street is seething, the slums of Jamestown.

  A young boy, perhaps seven; spiked up hair, face
  covered in grime, grime from dragging himself up in this
  hellish place. He carries a bag filled with the detritus he's
  picked from the rubbish bins of the rich. He wears a
  distinctive red t-shirt that is several sizes too big. He
  moves along the street, avoiding a disinterested passersby.
  As he passes an alley he hears something. An animal-like
  growl. He stops.

  Down the alley he can see two figures. One is a male. He is
  clutching another clothed figure; female.

                      KID
            Hey?! Hey!
                                                                    18




  At that instant the man turns to the boy. There, half seen in
  the slick shadows, the most piercing eyes, a bloody mouth,
  with fangs, hissing. The creature drops the woman and scales
  the sheer wall of the alleyway; clutching various handholds,
  up four flights, then gone.

  The kid, frightened, now makes to run off but bangs into a
  passerby. The man grabs the kid roughly.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
            Where are you going in such a
            hurry my little ruffian? Pilfering
            by the look of you?

  The kid struggles and the Man now sees the shape of the woman
  in the alleyway, slumped to the ground.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
                   (continuing)
            What's going on here? What'd you
            do to her?

                      KID
            Don't, I didn't do nothing. It was
            a Brother. It was a Brother did it.

  The man moves forward, dragging the kid. And he sees the
  woman there, deathly white in the alley. Dead eyes staring.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
            Oh dear god...

24 INT: NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY                           24

  We track past a sign that says "Museum of Spiritual Selection
  and Alchemistry." In the distance we can see a group of
  people in the hazy light.

  Cut to

  Augustus - the man we saw with Silus earlier - sitting on a
  chair surrounded by various objects. At his feet are a gaggle
  of school children, aged around ten; affluent looking, human.
  Augustus points to a strange, ancient looking glass apparatus.

                      AUGUSTUS
            300 years ago, with these simple
            instruments, the alchemist
            Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what
            we today call genetic science.
                                                                 19




                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            He deciphered that the Brothers
            were a new race of beings, sent by
            god, to serve and protect you.

  We see the faces of the children, rapt.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            De Angelo formed the church of the
            Brotherhood. He was a great great
            man, but there were others, bad
            men, who took what De Angelo had
            discovered and experimented
            without concern for the results.
            The science of genetics and all
            its power has been banned ever
            since. Who can tell me what came
            from these bad experiments?

  One child puts his hand up. Behind the child, in the
  distance, Augustus now sees Silus approaching; Silus
  obviously wants to talk to Augustus. Augustus points to the
  child while looking at Silus.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            Yes.

                      CHILD
            All the bad things. Like bad germs
            and flu.

  Augustus nods, watching Silus' ominous expression.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Yes. That's right.

  Augustus looks at the child and tries to smile.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            All the bad things.


25 EXT: SLUM, STREET - DAY                                  25

  The streets are wet. High above several large Zeppelins plod
  across the sky. We crane down to street level to find a
  police car pulling up through the steam. Lilly gets out,
  Jones beside her, wolfing down another bun.
                                                                    20




  There are cops everywhere. An alleyway is cordoned off. The
  dwellers of the slum have floated up and are baying like
  wolves, hassling the cops; some yell obscenities, generally
  along the lines of "where's the police when you need them?"
  Jones stares at the people.

                      JONES
            Someone should flatten this
            cesspool and start again.

  Lilly and Jones move towards the police cordon. Immediately
  a reporter accosts them.

                      STREET REPORTER
            Marm? The Tribune. Do you have any
            comments on the death?

                      LILLY
            No.

                      STREET REPORTER
            They're saying it was a Brother,
            is that true?

  Lilly stares at the reporter, pauses for thought. She
  whistles to one of the cops nearby, who then approaches.

                      LILLY
            Arrest her.

  Jones and Lilly push past as the reporter protests at being
  manhandled.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to Jones)
            Find any witnesses and shut them
            up.

  Jones nods and moves over to a policeman guarding the alley.
  Lilly ducks under the crime scene tape, moving into the alley.


26 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         26

  The alleyway is full of forensics personnel. Lilly moves
  deeper into the alleyway. We see her POV moving forward,
  finally revealing the body of the young woman who is
  surrounded by various forensics staff. Lilly talks to one.

                      LILLY
            Can I step in?

                      FORENSIC GUY
            With the traffic. What's it matter.
                                                               21




Lilly moves forward. She can now see the woman more clearly.
The woman is obviously dead; her pale white skin like wet
shining alabaster in the dark alley. Flashes from
photographic machines light the scene, almost blinding Lilly
and briefly revealing the true horror of the scene.

Lilly kneels and carefully begins to examine the body.

Another man now walks up and kneels next to Lilly; young,
good looking, obviously takes pride in himself.

                     DOMINIC
         Lil'.

                   LILLY
         Hello Dominic.

                   DOMINIC
         Have you seen it?

Dominic bends down and moves the dead woman's head,
displaying the side of her neck. A bite has torn the skin on
the side of her neck. The wound extends down, the carotid
artery sliced in two.

                   DOMINIC
                (continuing)
         It's a bite. If you know what I
         mean?

Lilly nods, then looks down at the woman's dead, cockeyed
stare. Lilly closes the woman's eyes.

                   LILLY
         Any identification?

She is passed a bloody ID. Lilly stares at it.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Tanya Garfield.

Jones now arrives.

                   JONES
                (to forensics team)
         Where do you get a cup of tea
         around here?

No one answers. Jones shrugs.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         There's a kid who saw it, down
         there.
                                                               22




Lilly sees the red shirted street urchin in the distance
being talked to by two uniformed policemen.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Says it was a Brother. And they've
         got another fellow, that's all who
         saw it.

Lilly nods.

                   LILLY
         Alright, we'll close this down
         gents. None of you are to say a
         word, not even to your old mother.

All the police officers stare at her; they know what she
means alright.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Jones. Make sure.

Jones shrugs and nods. Lilly gets up and moves towards the
street kid who is being talked to by two burly, grumpy
policemen. The boy is shaking.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         He saw what happened?

                   POLICEMAN 1
         Now he wont talk. Didn't see
         anything.

Lilly looks at the boy. So young.

                   LILLY
         What's your name?

The kid doesn't answer and gets a whack around the ears from
one of the policemen.

                   LILLY
                (continuing; to the
                 policeman)
         Stop that.

Lilly stares at the kid, as if the way he looks has keyed a
memory in her. She squats and looks him straight in the eye.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What's your name then?
                                                               23




                   KID
                (nervous)
         Albert.

                   LILLY
         You live around here?

The kid looks nervous. Lilly moves some of the bedraggled
hair out of the kid's eyes.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I grew up 3 streets from here.
         Matheson Lane. The Skrummers
         Workhouse.

                   KID
                (surprised)
         You did?

                   LILLY
         Or should I say, I crawled out of
         here.

The kid smiles. Lilly focuses on him now.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         No one else will do anything about
         this, you know? They just think
         this is a slum. No one really
         cares what happens to the people
         here. Except for you. And me.

The kid stares at her; she's a magician and he's a believer.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What did you see?

                   KID
         A man.

                   LILLY
         What kind of man?

                   KID
         A Brother.

                   LILLY
         You're sure it was a Brother?

                   KID
         He had teeth and everything.
                                                                    24




                      LILLY
            Where did he go?

  The kid turns and points to the shear wall of the alley.

                      KID
            He went straight up there.

  Lilly stares at the wall.

                      LILLY
            Alright, you go with these men,
            they'll look after you. I promise.

  She rises.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to the
                    Policemen)
            Get him to describe it all. And
            keep him away from everyone.

  The Policemen grunt and begin to lead the kid off.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to the
                    Policemen)
            And get him some food.

  Jones, now standing next to Lilly, moans.

                      JONES
            Now they'll all want feeding.

  Lilly looks at Jones's callous face; she's not amused.

  High angle POV of Lilly and Jones moving off. Someone is
  watching them from the roof above. The POV belongs to Silus,
  who stares down at them. In particular he watches Lilly. We
  see Lilly pause and then look up as if feeling she's watched.

  We see Lilly's POV of the building above. There is no one
  there.

  HA of Lilly looking up.

28 INT: POLICE STATION, HOWARD ANDERSON'S OFFICE - LATER      28

  A device flies toward the camera, sharp needles eject from it
  slamming into skin.

  Seated at the desk is a harassed, balding man (ANDERSON)of
  about 55. He's just finished vaccinating himself, wincing at
  the needle jabs on the soft skin of his arm. There are many
  other needle marks on his skin.

                        LILLY
                     (off)
              I've quarantined the neighborhood.

  Lilly stands before the man's large desk, which is lit by
  only a desk lamp.

                        LILLY
                     (continuing)
              As far as anyone knows we have a
              new influenza outbreak.

                        ANDERSON
              What about the telephonic
              companies?

                        LILLY
              They're cooperating, closing all
              phone lines in and out except
              directly to us.

  Anderson nods.

                          ANDERSON
              Sit, sit.

  She does.

                        ANDERSON
                     (continuing)
              You've done well Lilly. The
              reporter is more of a problem. We
              have 2 days by law before we have
              to release her. Then it's out.

  Anderson lays down the medi kit and stares at it as he
  motions for her to sit. She does.

                        ANDERSON
                     (continuing)
              I hate these things. I'm like a
              pin cushion.

                        LILLY
              It's better than the alternative,
              sir.
                                                                  26




  Anderson stares at her; a moment of tension.

                      ANDERSON
            I need you to stay with this,
            Lilly. You know Jamestown better
            than anyone, how to handle the
            people.

  Lilly acknowledges the compliment.

                      ANDERSON
                   (continuing)
            The Brothers have requested to be
            involved with the investigation.

                      LILLY
            That's nice for them.

                      ANDERSON
            You have a problem with it?

                      LILLY
            Not particularly.

                      ANDERSON
            Good. I think they can help. And
            I don't want someone working on
            this whose got something against
            the Church.

                      LILLY
            How do you know I don't?

                      ANDERSON
            Lilly, you're the least prejudiced
            person I know. In fact, you're the
            only one I know. That's important.
            The church is powerful, but more
            than that, people's faith in the
            Brotherhood is about all they've
            got these days. And the government
            knows it. Even the Queen herself
            is involved. This is political.

29 INT: POLICE STATION, COMMUNAL OFFICE - DAY               29

  Lilly enters, drinking a coffee. She begins to top it up from
  the coffee stand when Jones comes up to her.

                      JONES
            Lil'. He's here.
                                                                    27




  Lilly's expression becomes taut. She peers towards her
  office. She can clearly see an exceptionally well dressed man
  in her office with his back to us. It is Silus. A young
  female cop - Steph - is in there and we can see her kissing
  a ring on Silus' hand and Silus placing his hand on her head
  as if blessing her.

  Steph then exits the office and approaches Lilly and Jones;
  her face is flushed with excitement.

                      STEPH
            Do you know who he is? That's
            Brother Silus. They say one day he
            will lead the Brotherhood. He's a
            great man.

                      JONES
            I think I hear choir music.

  Steph flashes Jones a resentful look.

                      STEPH
            Do you respect anything?

                      JONES
            Hey. My old mum goes to church
            four times a week and gives blood.
            She's happy as a lark. Just don't
            expect me to kiss him, that's all
            I'm telling you.

  Cut to


30 INT: POLICE STATION, LILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS            30

  Close on the enigmatic ring on Silus' finger.

  We see Lilly is seated on one side of her desk, Silus on the
  other. Lilly is staring at the ring, then she studies a
  Photostat in front of her. There is a picture of a man, a
  rather perfect looking man.

                      LILLY
            Senior Brother Edgar... How long
            have you known about this?

  Silus opposite Lilly, his perfect, serene appearance an
  anathema in the grunge of the Jamestown police station. He
  watches her very carefully, listens to the way her finger
  taps the sheet in front of her, the sound of her chair
  swiveling, all the sounds very acute to him; she has a
  physical ease about her.
                                                                28




                   SILUS
         A matter of weeks.

Lilly smiles.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Is there something wrong?

Lilly stops smiling. For the first time she is still.

                   LILLY
         Yes. Withholding evidence.
         Covering up two murders. And no
         one's worried. If me or one of the
         people in Jamestown did that
         they'd be in the hell house with
         the key thrown away. It seems the
         church is able to do whatever it
         wants.

Silus nods.

                   SILUS
         You're right to not like it. It is
         political.

Lilly becomes more interested at this; at the bald honesty of
the statement.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         We thought we could find Brother
         Edgar ourselves. We were wrong.
         But now any debate is pointless.

Lilly stares at him. There is already something between them
even though they stand on opposite sides of a huge gulf. She
nods, accepting his point.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         The greatest danger is if this
         were to become public knowledge.

                   LILLY
         Wouldn't want anyone criticizing
         the church I suppose.

                   SILUS
         It's more than that Captain. This
         is about prejudice, or rather the
         nature of it. As a female surely
         you would understand.
                                                                 29




                      LILLY
            Really.

                      SILUS
            How many other Captains in this
            borough are female?

                      LILLY
            None?

                      SILUS
            How are your actions judged, the
            same or differently from the men.

  Lilly stares at Silus; he is an incredible being.

                      LILLY
            Differently.

                      SILUS
            Exactly. If a white man kills,
            then he is just a killer. If a
            black man kills, then all black
            men are suspect. That is the
            nature of prejudice. Those who are
            different are grouped together. If
            only one Brother does a bad thing
            then all Brothers are suspect,
            because we are different. And then
            what would this world be like, if
            there was no hope?

  Lilly nods, acknowledging the truth of it.

                      LILLY
            Alright then. So what do you
            suggest?

                      SILUS
            First, there is something you
            should hear.

  Cut to


31 INT: POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM - LATER               31

  Scummy, large briefing room. There are seven cops in here,
  perched on desks and chairs. Jones, Dominic, Frank plus four
  others. Lilly is also there. So is Silus, sitting, perfectly
  still, calm. Several of the cops look at him suspiciously.
                                                                30




                   LILLY
         Ok, ok, quiet down.

Everyone nods and shuts up as Lilly stands in front of the
men.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Gentlemen, there's no other way to
         put it. We have only 2 days to
         find the suspect.

There are guffaws from most of the policemen.

                   JONES
         There's no chance. Not a hope in
         hell.

                   FRANK
         He's right. We don't even know
         where to begin.

                   LILLY
         Quiet!

Lilly is angry. There is silence in the room. Lilly seems
more angry than she should be.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What you are about to hear will
         not leave this room. Everyone
         understand? Jones?

Jones shrugs.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I would suggest anyone with a weak
         stomach leave now.

No one moves. They all stare at Lilly.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         This is Brother Silus.

She motions to Silus, who rises, watching the glares from the
cops who eye him like a suspect.

                   SILUS
         Thank you Captain. Could we have
         the plate?
                                                                31




An old slide projector heats up as the main lights are turned
off. The projector sprays an image up on the wall. The face
of a killer, before he became one, the serene gaze of a
Brother.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Senior Brother Edgar. Until 3
         weeks ago, he was a trusted and
         talented theologian and scientist.

                   DOMINIC
         What'd he do?

                   SILUS
         He was personally responsible for
         developing the most recent
         influenza antivirals. It is
         because of him that most of you
         are alive today. His behavior
         appeared normal. Next.

3 photos come up. The victims.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         The victims. John Anderson. Julie
         Danes. Tanya Garfield. All in
         their early 20's, but beyond that
         no obvious connection. Next.

A Map.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         There is no precedent for Brother
         Edgar's behavior. No Brother has
         ever taken a human life, not in
         the 300 years since we began. Not
         one. Our role has been to preserve
         and maintain the human life. Not
         take it.

                   JONES
         Next he'll be wanting an fucking
         medal.

Silus stares directly at Jones now. Their eyes lock. Silus
continues, perfectly calm.

                   SILUS
         What I am saying to you is that
         Brother Edgar's behavior is
         aberrant. We
                                                                32

                        SILUS
                        (cont)
         don't understand it. And therefore
         it's difficult to predict. The
         only thing we know is where he
         will strike next.

                   DOMINIC
         How do you know?

Silus moves to the desk next to him. He passes something to
another cop who now sits at the desk. We see Lilly now. The
look on her face tells us that she knows what is coming and
she's not looking forward to it.

We see what Silus gave the cop. An audio tape. The cop places
the tape in a tape deck. He then switches it on. He then
turns the volume knob on an amplifier which now directs
static hiss to two big speakers.

We see the faces of the cops, all listening in the dim light
coming from the slide projector.

Above the level of the hissing tape there is another noise.
It is a wet sound. Like a cat would make if it were lapping
up milk. An another sound. Like an animal, moaning with
pleasure.

We see the cops; some of them are beginning to twig. And
there is another noise. It is a man; moaning.

                   MAN ON THE TAPE
                (off)
         Please. Please don't hurt me.

We see Jones and Dominic. Their glares say it all. And then
another voice.

                     EDGAR
                  (off, like to a lover)
         Quiet.

                   MAN ON THE TAPE
                (off)
         Please...

                   EDGAR
                (off)
         I said shut up!

Then we hear a punch and then noises which can only be
described as sounding like a dog killing something.

Jones springs out of his seat.
                                                                33




                   JONES
         Fuck!

                   LILLY
         Jones, sit down.

                   JONES
         Why are we listening to this?!

                   LILLY
         Quiet!

Jones stands there enraged. Dominic pulls him down back into
his chair. All the cops are appalled by what they have heard.
And then a voice.

                   EDGAR
                (off)
         Good. Now you're quiet.

We can hear Edgar moving around.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing; off)
         Did you hear that Silus? I hope so.

We see Silus, listening as intently as everyone else.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing; off)
         The next one will be tomorrow.
         There is a square, Bridge Square
         it's called. I will take the next
         one from there. You should try
         harder this time. Please try
         harder...

More moving around, then the sound on the tape cuts out. We
are left with only tape hiss. Everyone stares at Silus.

                   FRANK
         He sent this to you. Specifically.

                   SILUS
         We share the same mother. There is
         a bond.

The cops all stare at Silus' emotionless response.

                   LILLY
         There will be two teams. Frank, I
         want you and Abernathy up in the
         buildings around Bridge Square.

Frank nods.
                                                                   34




                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            I'll lead the other team with
            Dominic, Jones and Queen's
            Imperial Guard in support. No
            guns, batons only.

                        JONES
            What?

                      LILLY
            You heard me. He's to be taken
            alive.


32 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT                      32

  It has rained. The small square is dimly lit. At it's center
  is a small park with distorted trees. And a rundown
  playground. A rusty swing creaks. We see a figure there. It
  is Lilly. She watches the rusty swing creak. Then she looks
  up to the surrounding buildings.

  We tilt up to one of the buildings which is perhaps eight
  stories high; like the others around the square it is an
  apartment building. There is movement at the very top.

  Cut to


33 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOF - NIGHT                33

  POV from the top of the building, observing Lilly below enter
  a black, unmarked van. Then there is buzz from an RT. We
  reveal POV belongs to Silus.

                        SILUS
            Yes.


34 INT: POLICE VAN - NIGHT                                    34

  Lilly is in a police van. Jones and Dominic are there with
  her; both of them trying to come to grips with the strange
  stun weapons they've been given. And there are three huge,
  dark eyed soldiers there, dressed in the ominous black
  uniform of the Queen's Imperial Guard, cocking their electric
  batons; which fizz in the half light.

                        LILLY
            Anything?

  We cut between Lilly in the van and Silus on the roof.

                      SILUS
            No.

  Silus surveys the scene. He can see an Imperial Guard sniper
  over the square on the roof of a building. Below, in the
  street, we can see the silhouettes of several Brothers;
  unmoving, watchful sentinels.

                      LILLY
            It's getting late.

                      SILUS
            He will come.

                      LILLY
            Ok. We'll sit tight.

  Lilly closes the com. Jones is staring at her.

                      JONES
            This is a dud.

  Lilly ignores Jones and talks into the RT again.

                      LILLY
            Frank?

  Cut to


35 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT           35

  Frank is inspecting a stairwell of the building. He has
  Abernathy with him. He talks into his RT.

                      FRANK
            Yeah Lil'.

                      LILLY
                   (off)
            Anything?

                      FRANK
            Not a thing.

                      LILLY
                   (off)
            Check each floor again.

  Frank motions to Abernathy, who is already sighing.
                                                                    36




                      FRANK
            You heard her. Once more for the
            empire.

  Low Angle from the floor of the two men beginning to climb
  the stairs, their guns out.

  The shot stays where it is. We can see the stairs and the
  wall. We pause. The soundtrack is almost dead quiet, apart
  from the buzzing flouro above us. And then the CAMERA begins
  to advance, like a POV, heading for the wall ahead. It
  reaches the corner and then advances along cables running up
  to the roof. As it climbs we can see a ventilation shaft in
  the corner with no grill. The camera approaches it and moves
  into the shaft, continuous.


36 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - CONTINUOUS     36

  The shot continues to track through the man-sized shaft. As
  we move through the shaft - turning corners, going up
  floors - we pass grills. Some of them show light coming from
  the apartments within. We can hear an argument in one room.
  A crying child in the next. A TV blaring in another (playing
  porno). But mostly the rooms are dark. And as we move up and
  along, there is a scuttling NOISE, growing louder, as if we
  are approaching it.

  Then the NOISE stops.

  The camera halts, stares down the long ventilation shaft.
  Silence. Dead silence. The camera starts to move again and
  then turns a corner to run into the leering face of Edgar,
  the vampire, his teeth bared, his eyes reflecting in the half
  light. Then he smiles.

                      EDGAR
            Shoo.

  Cut to

  A rat, staring back at Edgar. The rat turns and streaks off
  back whence it came.

  A slight smile appears on Edgar's face; a smile that can
  chill the blood in your veins.

  Then he begins to move forward. We hear his breathing; low,
  but excited. He moves with the precision and strength of an
  insect. His eyes glisten and reflect light like an animal's.
  His skin is flesh white and milky in the metal shaft.

  Cut to
                                                                    37




  His POV approaching a grill. A subdued light comes through
  it. The POV approaches and sees into the apartment below.


37 INT: ROOM, SAME BUILDING - NIGHT                            37

  A woman, around 20, attractive, brushing her hair. She has
  just had a shower. She sits.

  Cut to

  The shaft. We see Edgar's hand enter shot. His hand grips the
  bottom of the grill and tries to open it. It doesn't budge.

  Cut to

  Inside the room, the woman turns and looks up at the grill.
  She thinks she's heard something. She stares; waits. She gets
  up and moves towards the grill high above on the wall. She
  places a chair under it, then gets up on it, standing on tip
  toes, trying to see if there's anything behind the grill. Her
  hand reaches out and tries the grill, to see if it's secure.

  Then she leans closer to it. Her face pressed right up
  against it. Closer. Closer.

  Cut to

  Edgar's white face, lurching into shot. Staring, staring.

  Cut to

  His POV. He is now looking through a different grill. This
  time there is a young man inside an apartment. Doing
  exercises.

  Edgar watches. And again that chilling smile.

  We see the man again, who gets up and preens himself in front
  of a mirror.

  Close on Edgar's eyes, devouring the sight of this pumped up
  flesh. The young man exits the room, going into a bathroom.

  We see Edgar's hand trying to open the grill. It moves.

  Cut to


38 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - NIGHT                       38

  Frank and Abernathy are on fifth floor, finishing a sweep of
  it. As they move they hear a CRASH. They stop. Then another
  crash, coming from the floor up. Then a SCREAM.
                                                                      38




   They look at each other, then begin to run to the stairwell,
   as Frank talks into his RT.

                       FRANK
             Lil'! Lil'!

             He's on the sixth floor! He's on
             the sixth floor!

                         LILLY
             Let's go.

   Everyone fires into action and begins to exit the van.


39 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOF - NIGHT                  39

   Silus watches from his vantage point. He can see Lilly and
   her team below rushing into the building adjacent to him. And
   then he sees, through one of the windows on the sixth floor,
   the flashes of gunfire.

   Cut to


40 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIR WELL - NIGHT                  40

   Handheld camera with Lilly and her crew rushing up the

42 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, HALL - NIGHT         42

   Lilly and her crew entering the hall. They are confronted
   with a view of the long hall. Halfway down there is a door
   with blood smeared on it. We can see Abernathy, lying in a
   pool of blood outside the door.
                                                                    39




  The cops stop. A door opens close to them. A large greasy man
  pokes his head out the door and gets the cops guns on him
  immediately. Lilly motions with her hand.

                      LILLY
                   (whispering)
            Police. Get back inside. Get back.

  The man returns and closes the door. The Imperial Guards now
  swing into action. They move forward towards the room, to the
  closed door. Lilly and her crew follow. The Imperial Guards
  get ready outside the door batons ready. One of them motions
  for Lilly and her crew to wait. Jones is nearest them. He
  goes down on one knee. Dominic moves past them and positions
  himself on the other side.

  Lilly kneels where she is.

  Beat.

  Then the Imperial Guards kick open the door and enter.

  Lilly waits, watching. There's no sound. Dominic begins to
  move forward, then enter the door to the apartment, his baton
  raised. Jones now moves forward, keeping his eyes on the
  door. There is no sound coming from the room.

  Cut to

  Lilly, kneeling in the hall. Also staring at the door. Too
  late to realize the door next to her is opening. Before she
  can react, she's staring into the face of Edgar; the eyes,
  the bloody mouth. Edgar is on her in an instant, moving with
  ferocious speed, whipping her like a rag doll into the room.

  Meanwhile Jones is edging towards the room Dominic entered.

  Cut to


43 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOM - NIGHT        43

  Lilly, trapped, held by Edgar, who stares at her. Then, in
  one swift movement, he lurches down, tearing her neck with
  his teeth. She cries out.


44 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, HALL - NIGHT        44

  In the hall, Jones is looking into the room Dominic went
  into. The lights come on. The room is empty. Just the cops
  and Frank's bloody corpse on the floor.

                      JONES
            Lil'.
                                                                   40




  Jones turns to see Lilly, but she's not there. The hallway is
  empty. He sees the door Lilly was pulled through. Then looks
  down. Blood is seeping from under the door.

                        JONES
                     (continuing)
            Fuck!

  Cut to


45 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOM - NIGHT       45

  Lilly being embraced by Edgar, she can't do anything. Then a
  loud crash on the door, as if someone is trying to break in.
  Edgar stops feeding, stares at Lilly.

  Beat.

                      EDGAR
            You're so strong.

  Then another crash on the door. Edgar drops Lilly. He propels
  himself towards a ventilation grill on the wall.

  Cut to

  Jones and the cops kicking the door in. It swings open to
  show Lilly on the floor. Jones stoops down.

                       JONES
            Lilly!

  Jones gets close to Lilly, starts squeezing the side of her
  neck, trying to stop the arterial blood from squirting her
  life away.

                      JONES
                   (continuing)
            Oh shit shit.

  Dominic enters and sees the scene. He yells into his RT.

                      DOMINIC
            Lilly's hurt. She's hurt!

  The other cops are now scanning the room. Meanwhile Dominic
  has found the ventilation shaft, blood smeared around the
  opening.

                      DOMINIC
                   (continuing)
            He's in the ventilation shaft!
                                                                  41




Jones then stares down at Lilly pressing one hand against the
wound. Close on Lilly, going into shock. She's shivering.

                   JONES
         She's dying! She's fucking dying!

At that moment SILUS appears at the door.

Silus stares at Lilly, bleeding to death in Jones' arms.
Silus immediately bends to her. With his free hand Jones
pulls out a vicious knife which he points at Silus.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Get away from her!

But Silus ignores the knife and moves closer to Lilly.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Get away or I'll stick you!

                   SILUS
         Do you want me to save her?

Jones wavers.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         She is dying.

Jones backs the knife away. Silus whips   his hand to the blade
of the knife, slashing his wrist, blood   immediately issuing
from the wound. He presses his bleeding   wrist to Lilly's
mouth. At first resistant, Lilly begins   to suck at the wrist.
Jones is appalled.

Silus then leans close to Lilly and whispers in her ear. All
the other noises in the soundtrack drop out.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall
         back, fall back...

Slowly she does. Silus removes his wrist from Lilly's mouth.
She is silent, comatose.

A medical team now scramble through the door, pushing past
Silus and the bloody Jones and begin to work on Lilly. For a
moment Silus and Jones stare at each other. Then Silus turns
to the ventilation shaft in the corner. He closes his eyes.
Listens.
                      42




          DOMINIC
He's getting away!!

         SILUS
Quiet.
                                                                      43




   The cops are silent. Stare at Silus who opens his eyes.

                       SILUS
                    (continuing)
             He's going up.

   We move in on Silus' ear. Closer, closer. Into his ear.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:


46 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT           46

   The long shaft and in the distance Edgar approaching, his
   eyes reflective, moving with the speed of an insect through
   the shaft, his bloody mouth.

   Cut to

   Silus, now also in the shaft, his gun out, moving forward. He
   turns a corner. The shaft is empty. He waits, watching,
   listening. He hears a scuffling.

   Cut to

   Edgar, the same, turning a corner to see Silus approaching
   him. Silus raises his gun. A puff emits from the end of his
   gun. The projectile hurtles towards Edgar, who just ducks out
   of the way in time.

   Edgar turns. There is a grill next to him. He smashes it with
   his foot.

   Cut to

   Silus approaching the junction, turning the corner, just in
   time to see Edgar's legs pass through the hole.


46A INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - CONTINUING                  46A

   We see Jones move into the hall, looking at the roof,
   searching. Then he looks at Lilly's blood which covers his
   hands. He pockets his stun weapon and pulls out his own
   dangerous looking gun.

   Cut to


47 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, DIFFERENT FLOOR - NIGHT             47

   A door bursts open. Edgar - in slow motion - crashes through
   the door and into the hall. The sound track is a huge driving
   slab of choral orchestral music.
                                                                    44




  The camera tracks back as he starts to mount the wall, his
  momentum carrying him diving towards the camera.

  Cut to

  Silus enters the empty hall. No Edgar. Then he sees in the
  roof, a manhole cover, slightly ajar.

  Cut to


48 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, CEILING CAVITY - NIGHT             48

  Silus' POV as he climbs into the crawl space, its ceiling
  following the pitch of the roof. It is dark and extends for
  a long way. Silus squats in the sub light like a beautifully
  dressed animal.

  What he can't see are two blinking eyes above him in the
  rafters of the dark roof. It is Edgar. Edgar drops, Silus
  turns too late as the weight of Edgar drives into him,
  sending both of them through the floor of the ceiling cavity
  and down...


49 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, ANOTHER HALL - NIGHT               49

  ...to fall, a dead weight, crashing down onto the floor of
  the hall in a hail of debris. Edgar is on top of Silus and
  strangling him, and then he stops and turns.

  He moves just in time to avoid a bullet from Jones' gun which
  glances Edgar's cheek, sending off a wisp of burnt colored
  smoke.

  Cut to

  Jones. Gun smoking, standing at the other end of the hall.

  Edgar screams the scream of something from the animal
  kingdom. Then turns and runs.

  Cut to

  Silus rising, pulling out his gun. Jones points his gun, but
  Silus is obscuring his view.

  Cut to

  Edgar runs away down the hall.

  Then on Silus. Very still, very silent. Close on his finger
  pressing the trigger.
                                                                45




The camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see
the projectile entering the gun's chamber and the hammer
igniting it.

The projectile explodes out the end of the gun.

High Angle of the projectile flying towards its target, the
ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective
surface, cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the
side of the capsule.

Then Edgar, camera tracking back at high speed.

Slow move in on Silus' cool gray eyes.

Then whack! The projectile stabs into Edgar's back, the claws
springing forward to hook onto Edgar's flesh, we see the
fluid within the transparent projectile flow into Edgar, see
Edgar's eyes widen, see his POV of the approaching window
then...

Crash. Edgar's head implants itself in the wall below the
window, the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over
Edgar's numb stare.

In the background Silus stands. Motionless.

We see Jones walking forward, gun still pointing, heading
towards Edgar. Silus turns and steps in front of him.

                   JONES
         Get out of my way.

                   SILUS
         No.

Jones stares at Silus and contemplates firing.

                   JONES
         He killed Lilly.

Silus doesn't move. He stares calmly at Jones.

Jones points the gun in Silus' face.

Beat.

                    JONES
                 (continuing)
         Bang.
                                                                     46




   Jones lowers his gun. We end close on Silus' serene face.

50A INT: SFX - CONTINUING                                      50A

   Black. Voices in the dark, quiet at first, then growing more
   frightening; then the hint of a face, in negative - Edgar -
   then screams, like the screams of an animal on the hunt. And
   another face, alternating with Edgar's. Silus.

                                            CUT TO:


51 INT: HOSPITAL, LILLY'S WARD - DAY                           51

   High Angle of Lilly asleep, lying on a hospital bed. We drift
   down. Again there is rain, pounding against the window. Her
   body flinches; she is in a dream, a nightmare. As we drift
   closer to her, her eyes open, staring straight up and then to
   the left. Then grim recognition.

   Cut to Low Angle on Silus standing above her, examining the
   tube that runs a clear fluid into her in a slow drip.

                       LILLY
             Antibiotics. They say it's like an
             animal bite.

   Silus nods. He slowly sits on the bed.

                       LILLY
                    (continuing)
             I want to thank you.

                       SILUS
             We all caught Edgar.

                       LILLY
             I don't mean that. The blood, they
             say it saved my life. Is it true
             that people who go to church are
             given your blood?

                       SILUS
             Sometimes the rituals call for it.
             Some say they have visions from
             it. That it restores their health.
                                                               47




Silus regards her and she him. She reaches out and touches
his hand, almost retracts at the smooth texture of the skin.

                   LILLY
         So smooth.

She turns over his hand to reveal the wrist; the scars are
almost gone from where Silus cut himself.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Healed already.

                   SILUS
         In some ways my body is like a
         human embryo. The cells regenerate
         quickly. It is why we live so
         long. Will someone come for you?
         Your family?

She releases his hand.

                   LILLY
         I don't have one. Not any more.

                   SILUS
         I see.

                   LILLY
         Influenza. My husband was quick.
         But my daughter, Mary, her little
         body fought it for a long time. So
         I just waited. Hoped. But then you
         realize how cruel hope is. And you
         just want it to end. Not to stop
         her suffering, but to stop my own.

                   SILUS
         I am sorry.

                   LILLY
         Do we seem pathetic to you?

                   SILUS
         No. Fragile. Worn down by nature.
         But you fight back.
                                                                      48




                       LILLY
             Yes. We're good at that.

   Lilly stares up into Silus' serene face. Silus smiles. Then
   stands.

                       SILUS
             I think yours will be a good life
             to watch, Lilly. Goodbye.

   Lilly tries to smile as Silus turns and walks off down the
   ward.

   Close on Lilly who looks grim. Then she turns to the window.
   Rain again, blowing hard against the pane.


52 INT: HOSPITAL,LILLY'S WARD - CONTINUOUS                      52

   As Silus leaves the ward he passes Jones, who's been standing
   there as if he's been watching them. A beat. Then Jones
   shoves a newspaper into Silus' hands.

                       JONES
             Nicely done. You're more human
             than I thought.

   Jones unceremoniously pushes past Silus and moves into
   Lilly's room. Silus reads the newspaper. The story tells of
   the recent deaths in Jamestown, explaining that it was an
   insane man who thought he was a Brother. The man's picture is
   shown; it is actually one of the victims.

   Through the window in the doorway Silus watches Jones
   approach Lilly. We are close on his enigmatic face.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


52A EXT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY- Establisher         52A

   We tilt down a grand building.
                                                                    49




53 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY                      53

  A huge foyer, shinning marble floors. All done in perfect
  taste. We see Silus cross the foyer and enter an elevator.
  The elevator doors close.


54 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - DAY      54

  Silus enters the room. There are several technicians at work
  at a console; again the organic nouveaux stylings of the
  Brothers. Augustus is also there. Next to him, someone who is
  obviously human. His lack of perfection stands out; the
  balding hair, dark rings under his eyes. Silus joins them.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Silus. You know Professor Liepsky.

  Silus shakes the Professor's hand. We see the hands touching,
  then slide apart with a wisping sound that makes the
  Professor wince a little.

                      SILUS
            How is he?

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            See for yourself.

  He taps one of the men at the console on the shoulder. The
  man hits a button and we see that in front of the console
  there is a huge glass window and beyond it a room which is
  now lit.

  Edgar is in there. And Edgar is not pleased. Even from here
  his glowering stare penetrates everyone in the room. From
  this distance we can't make out much, beyond the fact that
  Edgar is seated in a chair, in an otherwise plain white room.
  Around his chair is a strange "brace" of sorts, that seems to
  be holding Edgar in place.

                      SILUS
            Is the brace necessary?

                      AUGUSTUS
            He decapitated a guard as they
            brought him in. Even though he was
            sedated. He said he will drink us
            all dry.

                      SILUS
            Insane then.
                                                                    50




                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            Not quite.

  Silus now turns to the Professor.

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (continuing)
            He's become infected.

                      SILUS
            With what?

  The Professor looks to Augustus, as if worried he's said to
  much.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Go on, Brother Silus will soon be
            part of the inner circle of the
            Brotherhood. He should know this.

  POV approaching a curved, glass and metal door. On the door
  we see the words "Biological Containment Area."

                                           DISSOLVE TO:


56 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, BIO CONTAINMENT WARD -           56
   DAY- Establisher

  POV continues. There are 3 beds in here. In them, strapped
  down, 3 young woman. They are all insane, monstrous; the
  whites of their eyes are blood red.

  We see Silus observe them, but there is no horror in his
  eyes, just compassion. He moves to one of the woman and
  slowly grasps her hand. She lurches towards him.

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            If she wasn't restrained she would
            try to kill you. Don't worry, it's
            only transmissible through their
            blood. We designed it that way.

  Silus quietly turns to the Professor.

                        SILUS
            Designed?
                                                              51




                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         Genetically designed. Edgar was
         experimenting with the virus that
         created you. It was sanctioned by
         the government.

                   SILUS
         Since when do they sanction such
         things?

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         Since not one Brother has been
         born in 70 years. And never a
         female of your kind from which we
         could breed. And we need to breed
         more Brothers. You give the world
         hope. To the people you're like
         gods walking the earth.

                   AUGUSTUS
         This is what Edgar was doing
         Silus. Trying to genetically
         control the birth of Brothers.

Silus is now turns back to the poor creature on the bed.

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         And Edgar was successful. Each of
         these women carried a Brother, for
         a time. But, the virus... changed.
         Most of them have died and these
         will die soon.

Silus places his hand on the poor creature's head, blessing
her.

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                (continuing)
         And Edgar may be the first Brother
         to ever die.
                                                                    52




                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (continuing)
            Before that, his brain will wither
            like these women. Containment will
            be the issue.

  A door slamming behind Silus, he is in a strangely, eerily
  lit cubicle.

                      SILUS
                   (off)
            The police officer. Lilly. Did he
            infect her with this?

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (off)
            No. She was lucky. But it is in
            Edgar's blood. It always will be.

  ...and another door in front of Silus clicks, then slides
  open to reveal...


58 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - CONTINUING                58

  Edgar, sitting in the chair. He immediately turns to the
  door, his eyes burrowing straight into Silus.

  Silus moves forward. We track, Silus' POV, toward Edgar and
  the reality of his predicament is revealed.

  There are metal rods extending from the cage around him. Two
  at the sides. Two from the front. They strategically pointed
  at Edgar's chest and sides. If he was to try to get up, they
  would pierce him.

                      SILUS
            Hello my Brother.

  We can now see Edgar for the first time in something
  approaching a normal state. He looks similar to Silus,
  perhaps not quite so perfect. He radiates confident primeval
  power; less a man captured than an animal waiting. Edgar is
  smiles. He shifts a little, we see the rods piercing his
  flesh.
                                                             53




                   EDGAR
         Do you like what they've done for
         me Silus?

He moves again, as if enjoying it.

                   SILUS
         You are sick. We will help you if
         we can.

                   EDGAR
         Help me? I am being what I was
         meant to be. How can you help me
         from that? Or do you want to tame
         me? Brainwash me? Animal or
         vegetable, are those the two
         choices, Silus?

Edgar leans closer to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         I want to share the feeling with
         you. To feel their blood flow
         until every last drop is yours,
         until that weak, pointless little
         pump finally stops.

They are staring at each other very intently now. Edgar
smiles gently.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         The one I had, the police woman.
         She was so strong. I found it hard
         to leave her.

Edgar moves.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Is she dead?

                   SILUS
         She survived.

                   EDGAR
         Good. I will have her again.

For perhaps the first time, we see a real hint of anger on
Silus' face.

                   SILUS
         You won't touch her.
                                                                  54




  Edgar looks at his brother for a moment. Edgar's features are
  a paradox; almost sympathy for Silus followed by
  understanding. Then he smiles.

                       EDGAR
             You've chosen to watch over her.
             You want her don't you? I can see
             it in your eyes. You are like me.

  Silus' control has returned now.

                       SILUS
             I will pray for your cure, Brother.

  Silus then turns and leaves.

                       EDGAR
             I wont be able to forgive you for
             this you know? Not ever. In fact,
             when I get out of here...

  He moves violently, blood seeping from his wounds now.

                       EDGAR
                    (continuing)
             I will make you see. I will show
             you the way. I will see you drink
             your little police woman right
             through.

  By now frightening music has hummed into existence. Silus has
  paused at the door to the cell. Without looking back he
  passes through the door, leaving Edgar to his prison.

  Edgar, slowly turns back to the window in front of him. He
  sees himself reflected in it. The Camera moves into Edgar's
  eyes. The lights go out. All we are left with are his strange
  reflective eyes. Waiting. Waiting.

                                           FADE OUT:

60 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - NIGHT                      60

   A smooth, white walled cell. Flash edits of Edgar. Standing,
   posing, balancing literally on his fingertips, doing
   sensuous, slow gymnastic yoga. His hair has changed so we
   know time has passed. Finally he stands there; poised tensile
   steel. He slowly draws his finger nails against the shining
   floor of the cell, it almost looks like he's sharpening them.
   A tube comes from his arm for taking blood samples.

   Then Edgar begins to run directly at the glass window of the
   console room and then dives for it, smashing his head against
   it; blood and saliva left smeared there. Behind the glass
   window the console operators jump.

60B INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - CONTINUING                60B

   We see Edgar, slowly pulling himself up, blood and bruising
   apparent on his face. He smiles.

   We zoom in close to the glass, see Edgar's infected blood run
   down it until it congeals a little, caught in a tiny, almost
   imperceptible, hairline fracture.


61 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - NIGHT                      61

   Rain on the streets. A man, covered in tattoos - an affluent
   hood, is in a doorway snorting snuff

   Dominic, Jones and several other cops emerge from hiding
   places, pointing their guns at the man who puts his hands up.
   Hand held cameras follow several other cops and Lilly as they
   move into the building, again catching various hoods unaware.

   Lilly moves forward quickly, down a hallway and finds what
   she is looking for. In a room she discovers a harem of
   prostitutes, none of them older than ten years old. She
   stares at their doll-like faces, then lowers her gun.
                                                                    56



  We see Lilly, the scars from Edgar's attack now healed but
  still apparent on her neck. Her hair is shorter; she seems
  more worn down.

  Jones appears on her shoulder.

                       LILLY
             Take them away from here.

  Jones nods as Lilly walks off.

                       JONES
             You don't feel like a drink?

  But Lilly doesn't respond, she just walks off. Jones watches
  her leave. Then he stares at the round faces of the children
  in front of him, something approaching compassion there.

                       JONES
                    (continuing)
             Now my girls, anyone hungry?


62 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - CONTINUING                62

  Lilly exits the building into the rain, wrapping herself up
  against it. Then she stops, feels she's being watched. She
  looks up at the surrounding buildings. But there's nothing
  there. She pulls out an amulet with the symbol of the
  Brotherhood on it from under her jacket, and then after a
  beat, kisses it, a little smile comes to warms her lips
  against the cold. She leaves.

   Edgar's cell   is very dimly lit. Edgar is in front of the
   glass window   to the console room. He is repeatedly banging is
   head against   it. And his fingernails slide across the shiny
   surface; has   he simply gone insane? A voice comes over the
   Tannoy.

65 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 65

   We track through Lilly's apartment, silently. We enter the
   lounge to see Lilly sitting on a couch watching a strange
   looking valve powered globular Television-like device. We
   track ominously up behind her. Then stop.
                                                                58

                (off)
         I knocked.

Lilly turns to Jones.

                   LILLY
         You nearly gave me a heart attack.

Steph now emerges from the kitchen, dressed in a t-shirt and
shorts and carrying some food. Jones looks at her coldly.

                   JONES
         What's this then?

Lilly and Steph smile at the inference Jones is beginning to
draw.

                   STEPH
         My apartment was condemned, keep
         your hair on, what's left of it.

Meanwhile Lilly shushes them and turns back to the murky gray
images emitting from the television.

                   TV PRESENTER
         ...the ascension through the ranks
         of the Church has been fast for
         Brother Silus. He will now be the
         highest ranking cardinal outside
         the ruling council of the
         Brotherhood. This is largely seen
         as a reward for his handling of
         the last influenza pandemic.

Jones and Lilly watch as Silus is seen on the television in
an interview. Steph stares at the screen with awe, she
involuntarily kisses the symbol that hangs from a chain
around her neck; it resembles a Brother's ring.

                   STEPH
         Isn't he amazing?

Jones sneers under his breath.

                    JONES
         A saint.

                    LILLY
         Quiet.

We move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and
white TV screen.
                                                                59




                   TV PRESENTER
         You have been an opponent of those
         who want an easing in the ban on
         genetic research.

         Yes.

                   TV PRESENTER
         They would say you're denying
         legitimate research into a science
         that would change the world.

                   SILUS
         The church does not deny the
         potential. Only the motivations of
         those who want to exploit it. And
         the fact that we understand so
         little of its power.

                   TV PRESENTER
         With the elimination of influenza,
         are we approaching a new era where
         disease might be a thing of the
         past?

As she is saying this we are now close on the TV's speaker.
We then begin tracking out. We reveal the speaker is not part
of the TV, but the speaker in Edgar's cell. Edgar, smiling
coldly as he listens. As he listens he is gently gliding his
finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair; sharpening
them.

                   SILUS
         Disease is part of nature, it will
         always be a part of our lives.

Close on Edgar.

                     EDGAR
         How true.

                   TV PRESENTER
                (off)
         Brother Silus' confirmation
         ceremony will be held today in the
         sacred Chapel of St. Augustine
         where all the Brotherhood will
         gather.

Edgar listens, smiles.
                                                                        60


 66 INT: CEREMONIAL CHAPEL - DAY                                 66

    An ornate door; ancient, with strange, beautiful dark symbols
    carved into the old wood, like something out of a castle in
    Prague. The doors open and we see a large chapel. And within
    the large dark interior, lit by great long candles, the
    Brotherhood have gathered. They all stare at the camera,
    which we reveal is Silus' POV.

    We see SILUS. Unchanged, still the perfect creature he has
    always been. But for now the suit has gone and instead he
    stands draped in fine ropes, robes that carry his life on
    them; achievements, his rank, which is now high.

    In the distance, at an alter, stands AUGUSTUS. He is also in
    his gowns. A gong sounds and the Brothers, in unison with the
    music, begin to chant; it is eerie, it sounds like Tibetan
    monks.

 70 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM -           70
    CONTINUING

    Professor Liepsky, looking more aged, worn, enters the
    control room. Alarms are sounding. At the console is a human
    male who looks terrified.

                         CONSOLE OPERATOR
               I turned off the lights to try and
               calm him...

    Liepsky hits a button and it floods Edgar's cell with light.

    Edgar is right there, staring at them, his hands plastered
    over the glass window. He is covered in blood. In the
    background a bloody corpse on the floor. Edgar bangs his head
    against the glass, making Liepsky flinch. On Edgar's forehead
    we see scars from this kind of repeated banging.

                         CONSOLE OPERATOR
                      (continuing)
               We gassed him as usual. We waited
               10 minutes. He must have held his
               breath.

    The look on Liepsky's face says it all. We see Edgar. We had
    thought he was looking at the Professor. But he's not, his
    gaze is focused past the Professor to the dimly seen back
    wall of the control room.

    On it is a schematic, showing this room, other rooms on the
    level, the elevator shaft. Edgar is talking it all in.
                                                                   61




70A INT: CEREMONIAL CHAPEL - DAY                             70A

   Silus, on one knee before Augustus. Augustus now places a
   ceremonial sword at the back of Silus' neck, then draws it
   gently across the skin. Below, a Brother holds out a bowl to
   catch the drops of Silus' blood.

                       AUGUSTUS
             The blood flows, through them, to
             us and we preserve them, preserve
             the blood we are bound to protect.

   Silus raises his head. We see his face. He takes the bowl,
   drinks and then stands, holding it up to the other Brothers.

                       SILUS
             Let the blood be one and the two
             races join, as the Perfect
             Creature.

71 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - DAY                       71

   Close on Edgar, smiling. Calm.

                       EDGAR
             Today my brother enters the
             history books, Professor.

                       PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                    (over the tannoy)
             Move back!

   After a moment, Edgar slowly walks backward in perfectly
   smooth movements.

                       EDGAR
             Tonight all the Brothers will be
             with him. A perfect day for me to
             celebrate.

   From the far wall Edgar begins to glide forward, first in
   slow motion then ramping up to full speed, launching himself
   at the glass window. He bounces off it, leaving blood and
   saliva there.

   The Professor and the console operator share an unsettled
   glance.

   Edgar slowly stands. He stares very intently at the glass
   window in front of him. We zoom in on the glass. The small
   hair line fracture we saw previously now begins to lengthen
   before our eyes.

   Edgar's face. A smile. Then he is forward at high velocity
   before anything else can happen, smashing once more into the
   glass window, this time shattering it into a thousand tiny
   pieces.


71A INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUI71A

   Horrified the console operator begins to make an escape. But
   Edgar is on him before they're a few paces towards the door.
   Edgar's long fingers sink into his neck like the flesh and
   bone were clay. He screams.

   The Professor makes it to the door, pulls himself through and
   shuts it, but on Edgar's hand. Edgar doesn't flinch, but
   kicks the door open.


72 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, HALL - DAY                       72

   The Professor is now scrambling, half falling in slow motion
   as Edgar advances. As normal motion returns he kicks Liepsky
   in the head; the sound of impact has a nasty fatality to it.
                                                                     63



   Cut to

   Edgar. A door further down the hall is being unbolted. Edgar
   immediately runs towards it, then launches himself at it, his
   fingers extended like knives which enter the eyes of a guard
   who's coming through the doorway. The guard falls back on
   another two guards behind him.

   A round from a shotgun goes off, taking a small chunk from
   Edgar's side, but it's nothing more than a bee sting to him.
   His speed and precision is that of a creature who knows he
   only has one chance. He kicks the second guard under the
   chin, instantly snapping his neck, while flicking the third
   in the eyes with his sharpened fingernails. This guard falls,
   his eyes leaking orbs.

   Beat.

   Edgar crouches like a dark god of destruction, a siren
   sounding, the lights all going off, then flicking to red
   emergency lights. Edgar's eyes reflect in the half-light.
   Then he bares his teeth. At the end of the hallway he can
   hear the elevator arriving on this floor. Edgar smiles.

   The gleaming surfaces of the ground floor of the Brotherhood
   building. We hear the elevator begin to arrive. We pan off
   this to a desk where a receptionist sits.

   Cut to

   The Receptionist; she's trying desperately to place a call.
   We see the shadow from a figure cast over her and she turns
   and looks up, fear making her shake now.

   Cut to

   Edgar, staring down at her.

                        EDGAR

76 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, HALL - LATER                    76

  Slow steadicam along the underground halls. We see the bodies
  of Edgar's victims being cleaned up by personnel. We stop. In
  the distance we see the door to Edgar's cell open.

  Cut to Silus, observing the scene. The lighting is
  intermittent, flickering. Augustus is standing next to Silus,
  the weird light of the hallway reflecting in his eyes.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Now he carries this thing out into
            the world. Can you imagine what
            will happen if he infects others?
            Or if the experiments were known.

  We are left with Silus' beautiful, reflective eyes.

                      SILUS
            The question becomes what will he
            do next? He said he would kill us
            all. But especially the police
            officer. Lilly.

77 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY - SUNSET                             77

  Flashing lights of subway trains screaming through subway
  tunnels, wheels screeching as metal grinds on metal.


78 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY EXIT - CONTINUING                    78

  The streets are flooding like Bangkok in the monsoon; rain
  pouring off awnings that hang out over the street. The
  streets are full; prostitutes, drug peddlers, apothecary
  shops, the industrial revolution low down and dirty. There is
  a fight breaking out between two men who are dressed like
  punk rockers.

  Several people are alighting from a subway exit; the exit has
  "Jamestown/Brougham" on a nouveaux styled sign that might
  remind you of a Paris or Barcelona metro, only dirtier.

  We see Lilly in the distance, in her dark jacket, emerge from
  the subway. She begins the short walk to her apartment. The
  streets are crowded and there are plenty of Maori people in
  this area, so there's plenty of food stalls; the air is
  filled with the sound of evening prayers. Lilly stops at one
  of the food stalls and starts picking up vegetables. A Maori
  man comes out and smiles and they start talking in the local
  dialect. She buys a live eel.

  Across the street, in a doorway, we see a very weedy, sick
  looking guy - this is Freddy. Standing next to him is a
  Prostitute, swaying from the effects of laudanum.

                      PROSTITUTE
            Come on governor, you going to pay
            me or not?

                      FREDDY
            Soon enough my cherub. I've not
            finished with you yet.

  He sucks on something that looks like a ventaline inhaler,
  then pockets it, licks his lips and begins heading off down
  the street, the drunk Prostitute dragged along.

  Cut to

  Again, Lilly from a distance, walking along the street which
  is more deserted, now carrying a bag full of groceries. As
  she walks we begin to hear voices; violent, arguing. Lilly
  approaches an alleyway, the raised voices becoming louder.
  She slowly places her bag on the ground and then pulls out a
  revolver. She edges into the alleyway.


79 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - CONTINUING                  79

  Lilly's POV down the alleyway. It seems empty. The POV moves
  in a little and there in an offshoot of the alleyway we can
  see Freddy. He is standing over a woman who cowers; she's

  plainly a prostitute. Freddy points a gun at her head.

                      FREDDY
            You've been ripping me off! I
            should blow your dirty little
            brains out!

                      STEPH
                   (off)
            Police! Put the gun down now!

  And now we see, it's not Lilly we've been watching, but
  Steph. She points her gun at Freddy. Freddy turns to Steph.
  He slowly raises his arms.

                      FREDDY
            It's ok. I'm complying officer,
            see.

                      STEPH
            Put the gun on the ground and step
            away!
                                                                66




                   FREDDY
         I'm doing it.

Freddy puts the gun down. The Prostitute on the ground now
scrambles to her feet and heads towards Steph.

                   PROSTITUTE
         He's crazy! Fucking crazy!

She gives Freddy the finger then heads off.

                    STEPH
                 (to the prostitute)
         Wait!
                (to Freddy)
         Down! Right now, down on the
         ground!

Freddy gets down.

                   FREDDY
         I'm getting wet now.

Low Angle on Steph approaching. Behind her a FIGURE is
descending the wall behind him.

                    STEPH
         Shut up!

Steph is over Freddy now. He's staring up at her. He can see
that a shape has appeared behind Steph. EDGAR, his eyes
gleaming. Steph pulls out some handcuffs.

                   STEPH
                (continuing)
         Put your hands behind your back.

                   FREDDY
         Sure. Anything you say.

But before Steph can move forward, Edgar has her gun hand in
a vice-like grip. She cries out in pain as her wrist
disintegrates. As a reflex she stamps on Edgar's foot and
kicks him in the groin with her other.

He does not flinch. He smashes Steph into a down pipe on the
wall of the alley so that wet grit is ground into her face.
We then see Edgar's face at her shoulder.

                   EDGAR
         Nice to meet you again.

Edgar pulls back the jacket at Steph's neck to find no scars.
He pulls Steph's face towards him brutally, staring at her
profile.
                                                                67




He then smashes her head against the pipe so that she falls
unconscious to the ground.

                   FREDDY
         What's wrong?

                   EDGAR
         You brought me the wrong one.

                   FREDDY
         Does it matter, one's as good as
         the next?

Edgar's stare makes Freddy shut up and avert his eyes. Edgar
then turns on the tube on his arm so that blood drips into
the unconscious Steph's mouth; making her gag.

                   FREDDY
                (continuing)
         You promised me some of that.

Freddy's licking his lips.

Edgar studies Freddy, then raises his arm. Freddy just
stares. We see the tube on Edgar's arm that connects to his
veins. And in a moment Freddy has latched onto it and is
sucking like some kind of human leech.

                   EDGAR
         What do you see Freddy. Visions?
         Can you see your future?

For a moment Edgar strokes Freddy's hair, then rips the tube
away.

                   FREDDY
         Hey!

Freddy moves forward, but is pushed back by Edgar.

                   EDGAR
         Don't be a greedy little pig
         Freddy. You have to earn more.

Close on Edgar, his repellent features under the hood. He
looks up. Far above, through the falling rain, past the high-
rise slum around them; we see the moon hanging like a pearly
crescent in the sky. The moon is slowly obscured by clouds.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         We have more to do.

Cut to
                                                                    68




80 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - NIGHT                     80

  We see a figure exiting the subway. This time it is Lilly,
  following the same path that Steph took.
                                                                 69




Making her way through the crowded street. The rain has given
way to a fine mist.

Then, as Lilly moves forward she senses something; that
feeling again, that she is being watched. She stands for a
moment as people push past, looks up at the gothic Victorian
buildings that loom out of the drifting mist. But there is
nothing.

Lilly begins to make her way through the drifting mist,
casting glances at the odd passerby.

Then, ahead of her, there is one pedestrian in particular,
taller than the rest, wearing a great hooded jacket, who
stands out. He is immediately suspicious to Lilly. He is
slowly moving through the crowd towards her. From under the
hooded jacket we see the glint of the approaching figure's
eyes; an intense stare hidden in the shadows. The man now
puts his hand in his pocket as if he's reaching for something.

Lilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket, her gun a
cold hard presence in her hand. She stares ahead at the
approaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into
a pedestrian. Lilly continues forward, closer, closer. From
under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead
catches hers for a moment. The man now begins to approach
her, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for
something. A gun.

Lilly immediately pulls her gun. The mist beads on the
shining barrel of her gun. The man is raising his hand
towards her.

                   LILLY
         Police. Put your hands where I can
         see them!

The man now lurches forward, his hand rising towards Lilly,
her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun, as the
man looms closer. And then he is gone.

Cut to

The man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping
at the hands that now threaten to throttle him.

And we see Silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only
the second time, we see anger in Silus' eyes.

People in the street scatter as more Brothers emerge with
guns pointed. And Lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man
Silus is holding. On the ground, next to the man, she sees
what he had in his hand. A pamphlet. Asking people to come to
church service; a picture of a Brother priest serenely
beaming out from it.
                                                                 70




Meanwhile the man that Silus has is gagging on the ground,
Silus' hand still on his throat. He's begging.

                    PARISHONER
          Holy brother, please...

Lilly grabs Silus' shoulder.

                    LILLY
          Let him go.

She shows Silus the pamphlet.

                    LILLY
                 (continuing)
          He's harmless. Let him go.

The man now pulls back his hood. He is black, his large,
watery eyes stare up in awe at Silus. He grabs Silus' hand
which now relaxes and draws Silus' ring to his lips, kissing
it, in tears.

                    PARISHONER
          Forgive me. I've offended you...

We see Silus' dark stare.

A beat.

Then Silus reaches out and places his hand on the man's head.

                    SILUS
          No. You are divine. It is the
          world that offends me.

Silus rises, the Parishioner just lays there in awe. Silus now
turns to Lilly who is on his shoulder. And now Lilly realizes
for the first time that it is Silus.

                    LILLY
          Brother Silus. What's going on?

We then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the
rain. The door opens and Jones emerges, taking in both Lilly
and Silus. A grim smile of realization comes to Jones' face.
He pulls something from his jacket.

81 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, LOUNGE - NIGHT                     81

  Steph's ID is tossed down on a table.

                      JONES
                   (off)
            A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went
            to see, found this. One witness.
            A prostitute.

  Jones tosses down a photo. It is Freddy, looking suitably
  scummy in a police identikit photo.

                      JONES
                   (continuing)
            She identified this lovely
            citizen. We thought maybe he had
            a grudge or was crazy. I guess we
            were wrong.

  Silus stands by the window; lights make patterns on his face.

                      SILUS
            It is Edgar.

                      LILLY
            And now he's got Steph. Why does
            he want her?

                      SILUS
            She is not what he was after.

  We see Lilly slowly getting it.

                      LILLY
            Steph was staying with me. She was
            wearing my coat. It was me he was
            after. Wasn't it?

  Silus now turns, slowly moves towards her,   coming out of the
  shadows. Lilly finds it hard to return his   gaze,
  involuntarily touches her neck where it is   scarred from
  Edgar's attack. Jones is watching all this   very carefully.

                      SILUS
            Yes. He will come for you Lilly.

                      JONES
            Right, then we put you somewhere
            safe and set up this place.
            Shooters on the roofs. And when he
            comes we blow his fucking brains
            out.

                      SILUS
            He will know. He will see and hear
            it.
                                                                  72




  Lilly is staring at Steph's ID.

                      LILLY
            It has to be me. That's what he
            wants. It's the only chance
            Steph's got.

                      JONES
            What are you talking about, she's
            probably dead already...

                      LILLY
            Jones! And we can't make it too
            hard. He has to be able to get in.
            He can't suspect anything.

  Jones is shaking his head. Silus just stares at Lilly.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            That's the way it will be. I'm the
            bait.

  Close on Silus.


82 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - SUNSET                    82

  We are in a large, derelict warehouse; detritus and stacked
  and smashed wooden crates. Music is playing somewhere in the
  distance from a phonograph. We track through the space.
  Daylight comes through cracks in the blacked out windows high
  above, creating tiny shafts of laser light that flicker from
  the dust.

  We pass through the stacks of crates that are like a high
  walled maze. Music emits from a stereo, loud. We continue to
  move down a hall. Through the detritus, towards a door. A
  hand opens the door.


83 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          83

  In the corner of the room, huddled, chained to the floor, is
  Steph. She does not look good. In fact she looks very sick.
  There are tubes coming off her arm.

  Freddy stoops down and begins to check the tubes running from
  her arm. There are small taps on the tubes. He turns them on.
  Blood begins to flow from her into a cup that is already
  stained red. As he turns it off Steph shivers, her eyes open.
  The whites of her eyes are blood red; she is sick. She
  speaks, weakly.
                                                                  73




                      STEPH
            Help me. Please, I'm sick. Help me.

  She reaches for Freddy, but he pulls away. Freddy's not
  looking too hot either.

                      FREDDY
            Don't fucking touch me.

  He picks up the half filled cup and leaves. Steph stares
  after him. Tears welling in her eyes, beginning to shake now,
  moving against the chains that bind her. But they stay fast.


84 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                84

  Freddy moves into the large warehouse space, the music still
  echoing. Freddy looks around, searching for Edgar.

                       FREDDY
            Hey!

  His voice echoes through the empty space.

                      FREDDY
                   (continuing)
            Where've you gone now?


85 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           85

  A POV, wavering slightly, the hint of a whispering breath. We
  see Lilly's apartment. The shot zooms in at high velocity,
  searching the windows, zooming in here to check the lock on
  this window, then on that. Then the shot wildly pans and
  twists to the street below. Again it zooms in, to the
  entrance of the building, to a couple walking past in the
  night, as if searching for any sign of something out of the
  ordinary. We can hear the couples voices, talking about inane
  things.

  Cut to Edgar's face in the shadows. His eyes reflective, his
  whole being readied and concentrating. He closes his eyes. We
  move around to end close on his ear, the soundtrack becoming
  stark as the sounds of the night become eerily separated and
  distinct. One sound in particular, a kind of metal sound,
  scratching slightly, growing louder.

  Edgar's eyes open.

  Cut to

  A zoom speeding towards Lilly's bedroom window, then swooping
  at the last minute to end on an apartment one floor down.
                                                                    74




  And there, gently moving in the night air, a partially open
  window, the latch grinding in the breeze.

  Cut to


86 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUING                         86

  A whiz pan POV, ending on the lounge of Lilly's apartment;
  as if we just caught the last part of someone turning their
  head, as if alerted. All the lights are out. We slowly begin
  to move forward, dipping and gliding silently, into the
  hallway. Slowly we approach a doorway and creep into...


87 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                87

  We can see Lilly lying on the bed, her skin alabaster in the
  moonlight that comes through the window blinds. Closer closer
  until we halt above her.

  Cut closer to see Lilly asleep; her hand grips her service
  revolver which protrudes from under her pillow.

  We see Silus standing above her, his eyes glisten in the
  sub light. As he watches, Lilly moves, as if she's having a
  dream, her hand grips the gun beneath her pillow.

  Silus slowly bends down, close to her. Watching. Then he
  reaches out, as if to gently wake her, then stops as Lilly
  stirs. She turns, curling up into the fetal position. Silus
  is confronted with the old scars from Edgar's attack.

  For a moment Silus stares at her. Stares. Then very quietly,
  smoothly, he moves his head down, very close to her arm. He
  sniffs it, as you would something very delicate, very
  complex. Then he closes his eyes.

  We see Lilly, her arm. Silus slowly enters frame, moves his
  face close to Lilly, moves along her arm as if taking in her
  scent. Slowly her arm raises, as his face moves up her body
  to her neck, her hand now embracing Silus' head. Closer as
  his face is near hers and still with eyes closed her face
  turns towards him, his dark lips and hers are close.

  Cut to

  Silus, back where he was, smelling her arm. His eyes open and
  he moves back a little, as if shocked by the daydream he has
  just indulged in.

  We see Lilly, as she was before, curled up in the fetal
  position. Then a sound.
                                                                    75




  Silus immediately pivots, his gun immediately pointed at the
  figure who stands silhouetted in the doorway. Jones.

                      JONES
            What are you doing?

  The camera immediately drops, through the floor of Lilly's
  apartment to the apartment below to find...


88 INT: APARTMENT BELOW LILLY'S - CONTINUING                   88

  ...Edgar, standing in the apartment below, immediately
  freezing. We zoom into his ear as he listens.

  Flash cuts of sound and image; a large man turning in his bed
  and groaning, a tap drips in an apartment, a fluorescent
  colored mosquito catcher vaporizing a mosquito with a zing,
  then a woman's lips; whispering...

                      LILLY
            What is it? Jones?

  Cut to


89 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                89

  Silus above Lilly, his hand up to silence her, Jones stock
  still in the doorway. Waiting, waiting...

  Bang, Silus rushes to the window of the apartment, ripping it
  open, pointing his gun below. But there is no one there. Then
  Silus spots it. On the floor below the window is open, a
  curtain gently wafts out of the window in the breeze. Silus
  turns to Jones and Lilly.

                      SILUS
            Stay here.

  Silus immediately drops out of the window.

  Cut to

  Lilly rushes to the window and looks out expecting to see
  Silus dead on the pavement below, but the street is empty.
  And then she sees it; the window below her apartment is open.


90 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING                90

  Lilly, gun extended, moving forward towards her apartment
  door, Jones behind her, trying to grab her.
                                                              76




                   JONES
         Get back here, Lilly!

But Lilly shoves him off, opens the door and moves into the
hall and waits.
                                                                    77



  She hears more smashing from the other side of the building.
  She turns to Jones.

                        LILLY
            Cover me.

  And she's off, smashing the apartment door in front of her
  with her foot and moving into the apartment, towards the
  window beyond. Jones can only curse, lift his gun and move
  after her.


91 INT: APARTMENT ADJACENT TO LILLY'S - CONTINUING             91

  Lilly's POV crashing through the apartment and reaching the
  window, pulling it open to see...


92 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, REAR - CONTINUING                   92

  ...Lilly's POV of the city below. We see her search with her
  eyes, and then she sees it.

  Cut to

  Lilly's POV, closer, looking down on Edgar running over a
  roof.

  Cut to

  Edgar running towards us as we track back, then he launches
  himself...

  Cut to

  Low angle, Edgar jumping from above us, to land almost on the
  camera, stopping himself by grabbing iron piping protruding
  from the side of the building.

  Edgar turns, smiles, thinking he's escaped; then shock comes
  across his face.

  Cut to

  Edgar's POV as Silus flies through the air and crashes
  straight into the camera. Silus' hands go straight for
  Edgar's throat, stopping Edgar from falling. The two
  Brothers eyes lock.

                      EDGAR
            You saved me...

  Then Edgar's smile. He pushes off the wall with his legs,
  sending both of them tumbling over the railing.
                                                                78




We see them fall, Silus hitting a railing which sends him
spinning out of control, whilst Edgar manages to clasp onto
it.

Cut to

Silus' POV, tumbling wildly out of control, heading for the
ground, finally coming to a jarring stop, the view of the
alleyway upside down.

We now reveal Silus, only just conscious, caught in wire
netting, hanging upside down in the alleyway.

And there, landing, is Edgar, poised, watching. Edgar slowly
approaches so that he is near. He bends down to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         When will you admit it. You're
         just like me.

Edgar's nose is bleeding. He dabs some on his fingers, then
raises his hand to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Maybe you need some encouragement.

He brings the dripping blood closer to Silus, closer...

Then an explosion; the sound of bullets whistling through the
air. Then Edgar is gone.

Cut to

Lilly and Jones entering the alleyway to find Silus still
hanging from the railing.

                   LILLY
                (to Jones)
         Get him down.

Lilly then moves into the adjacent alleyway to search for
Edgar.

                   JONES
         Lilly, wait! Damn you. Lilly!

She turns and gives him a final quick look.

                   LILLY
         If he escapes then Steph is dead.
         Just follow me when you can, hurry!

Cut to
                                                                79




Lilly moving through a slick wet alleyway; water plops and
dribbles from leaking pipes. She swings her gun towards
movement; water crashing out of a pipe. Lilly's shaking,
terrified, but she keeps on going. And then another sound and
she swings her gun to find Edgar, standing in the shadows,
waiting.

                   EDGAR
         The little policewoman.

                   LILLY
         Don't move!

Edgar purposely raises his hand so that she fires; the bullet
going through the flesh of Edgar's arm; his arm now smoking.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I said don't move. Where is she,
         where's the girl?

Edgar can only smile.

                   EDGAR
         Oh, I've killed her already.
         Essentially.

Then he moves, she fires, but he's too fast, spinning,
diving, in an instant he has the gun, twisting it and Lilly's
arm behind her back. She fires, once, twice, the bullets and
smoke rising up from Edgar's side. He twists harder, the gun
then falling to the ground. Edgar is now behind her. He moves
his face close to hers.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Has he tasted you yet, little
         policewoman?

Lilly tries to twist out of his grasp.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         He's just the same as me, you know
         it, you can feel it too.

                   LILLY
         He's nothing like you.

Edgar's face twists into a smile.

                   EDGAR
         We will see. You will be my tool.

                                         JUMP CUT:
                                                                  80




  A cat, hissing, screeching.

  Cut to Silus and Jones entering the alleyway, the cat tearing
  away from them in fright. Jones moves forward and we tilt
  down to see Lilly's gun lying on the wet cobblestones, smoke
  wisping from the barrel. Jones stoops down and picks up the
  gun, then turns to Silus. After a beat, Jones throws the gun
  at Silus' head. Silus dodges it easily and it clacks onto the
  cobblestones.

                      JONES
            You happy now?

  Cut to


93 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, TOILET - DAY               93

  Close on Freddy's face, looking at himself in a mirror. He's
  pulling back his eyelid; his eyes are bloodshot and he's
  sweating. Freddy then pushes the mirror shut and we see
  Edgar, silhouetted in the bathroom doorway.

                      FREDDY
            You scared the shit out of me.
            Hey, the police woman. She's real
            sick. To tell the truth I don't
            feel so hot myself.

  Edgar approaches, still silhouetted.

                      EDGAR
            I want you to take her and put her
            where they'll find her.

                      FREDDY
            But I'm sick. She's given me
            something...

  Edgar moves incredibly fast, we can't quite see what he has
  done but we suspect he has just buried his hand in Freddy's
  chest. We see Freddy's face, stunned, deathly white.

                      EDGAR
            What have I said to you?

  Freddy falls, leaving Edgar's hand in mid air; we can't see
  clearly, but it likes frighteningly like he has one of
  Freddy's internal organs in his hand.

                      EDGAR
                   (continuing)
            I hate arguments.

  Cut to
                                                                    81



94 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         94

  Close on a pendant; the symbol of the Brothers.

  We pull out to reveal Steph, very sick now. Edgar is has her
  wrapped in a sheet and is half carrying her along a decrepit
  alley. Ahead of him is a street; we can see several passersby.

  Edgar sits Steph up against the wall of the alley, propped
  up. She really is sick. She coughs.

  Edgar looks at her for a moment. Then after consideration,
  takes her hands and crosses them, and places an envelope in
  her limp hands. Happy with the composition he moves off.

  Cut to

  A close High Angle on Steph looking up, her bloodshot, dazed
  eyes staring blankly. We drift up and away from her. Already
  the rats are beginning to come out and sniff her.


95 INT: HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY                                95

  There are several nurses running towards us, they turn and
  move down a hallway. We reveal Jones and Dominic. They move
  to the nurses station and Jones flashes his ID.

                      JONES
            Stephanie Richards, you just
            brought her in.

  And then a scream. Blood curdling; the sound of someone
  insane, screaming their lungs out, hurling abuse. We see the
  faces of the cops and the terrified nurse in front of them
  who points down the hall where the noise is coming from. The
  Cops move off. The nurse then sees someone else arrive. She
  raises the pendant that hangs around her neck and kisses it.

                      NURSE
            Thank god you're here.

  We see who has entered. It is Silus. Near him there are
  several people sick. They look sick; like Steph and Freddy
  looked.

  Cut to


96 INT: HOSPITAL, ISOLATION WARD - CONTINUING                  96

  Jones and the Dominic move through an anteroom. Nursing staff
  and doctors are madly running about. The screaming we heard
  before punctuates the noisy clutter of medical procedures.

  Jones approaches a door; it has the words "level 4 isolation
  unit" on it. A large Guard blocks his way.
                                                                   82



  Jones shows his ID. A figure brushes past them and enters the
  door; the figure is fully decked out in something like a
  spacesuit.

  Jones and Dominic are ushered sideways, to another room. This
  room has a glass viewing window which looks into the adjacent
  room. A middle aged Doctor stands there, his thumb nail in
  his mouth, looking thoughtful. When he turns towards Jones,
  we can see there is fear in his eyes. Jones shows his ID.
  Screaming from within the adjacent room draws his attention
  and that of Jones.


97 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - CONTINUING                   97

  In the adjacent room two nurses are trying to put in a line
  to Steph's arms which are restrained by straps. Steph lies on
  a bed. She looks truly sick; her hair matted, her skin
  blotchy. Her eyes are also blood red, the tiny blood vessels
  hemorrhaging. And she is screaming abuse at the nurses and
  Doctors who work on her.

  Close of Jones, staring at the scene.

  Silus now enters the room. Almost immediately Steph stops
  screaming. She is staring directly at Silus; even this
  deranged, she is still in complete awe.

                      JONES
            Will she recover?

  The Doctor turns to Jones; the Doctor looks puzzled.

                      DOCTOR
            No. Containment is the issue now.
            She is... insane. And we've had
            more cases, 10 in the last hour.

  The Doctor leaves.

  Jones turns to Silus.

                      JONES
            What is this? What is it?

                      SILUS
            It comes from Edgar. He has shared
            his blood with them.

                      JONES
            You're telling me that he's out
            there spreading this around?

  Jones gets close to Silus, intimidating.
                                                                        83




                         JONES
                      (continuing)
               He'll give it to Lilly!

    Dominic gets in between.

                         DOMINIC
               Jones! Back off.

    Dominic pushes Jones back and then stares at Silus.

                         DOMINIC
                      (continuing)
               This is spreading.

    Silus doesn't speak, just stares at Steph.

                         DOMINIC
                      (continuing)
               Brother Silus?

                         JONES
               That's it, Lilly's dead.

                         SILUS
               No. He will keep her alive.

                        DOMINIC
               Why?

                         SILUS
               So that I will come for him.
               That's what he wants.

    Dominic pulls an envelope from his jacket and passes it to
    Silus, who opens it to discover a beautifully handwritten
    letter.

                         DOMINIC
               It says, "Everything flows from
               me. My blood will change the
               world." What does that mean?

    Silus stares at the two men. Then turns to Steph, her eyes,
    creepy, still locked on Silus.

103A EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM BUILDING, ROOF - NIGHT                  103A

    Jamestown, from above. We drift down so that we see the
    buildings, see fires breaking out, hear screams echoing
    through the night. We continue down towards the rooftop of
    one building in particular. We see one of the infected
    citizens of Jamestown standing on the roof, screaming out
    into the night like some crazed animal.

    We continue past the creature, then travel through a
    ventilation shaft on the roof. We hurtle down this, down,
    down to the depths of the building and out the shaft into a
    subterranean basement. We drift through a doorway in the wet
    stone wall, down a tunnel, to finally enter a room.

    And we see Lilly. She is covered in grime, her hands bound
    above her head with chains to an ancient, ornate pipes that
    twist through the place. She looks up at us.

    Cut to


103B INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING             103B

    Edgar, now standing above Lilly. He bends down, checking the
    chains that bind her. His face moves close to her so that he
    can smell her. Hear her heart pounding. See the scars from
    his previous attack. Then a noise, echoing through the
    tunnels. The sound of the mad infected denizens of the
    containment zone, screaming out into the night. Edgar smiles.

                        EDGAR
              It almost sounds like children
              playing, don't you think?

                        LILLY
              No.

                        EDGAR
              I looked at your body. You have
              borne a child.

    Lilly's features tense.

                        EDGAR
                     (continuing)
              Did you abandon it? Your kind are
              good at that.

    Even though her position is impossible, Lilly won't show
    Edgar fear.

                        LILLY
              Why don't you just kill me?

    Edgar just smiles. Lilly spits in his face and screams at him.
                                                               85



                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Kill me!

Edgar grabs her by the throat, for a moment anger boils out
of Edgar, but he restrains himself.

                   EDGAR
         I can see why he likes you. But I
         have a better use for you. To save
         you, Silus will take my blood.
         Join me.

                   LILLY
         You're insane.

                   EDGAR
         The world is insane. I am better
         than you. But they force me to
         serve you. Does that happen in a
         sane world? Forced to watch you
         waste the most precious thing you
         have. Life.

Then Edgar's face changes; he stares at her with pity, for a
moment we see a hint of the noble creature he used to be.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Do you know what they do to us
         when we are born? They take us
         from our mothers. Force us into a
         life of loneliness, and denial.
         Can you imagine a life like that?

Lilly senses an opening.

                   LILLY
         You don't have to do this. You can
         change things.

Edgar places his head in his hands, he seems to be weeping.

                   EDGAR
         You have reminded me of something.

When he looks back up at her, he is terrifying to behold.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         I must search out my mother, if
         she still lives. And kill her for
         what she did.
                                                                      86




   Edgar smiles quietly, rises and exits.

   We are left with Lilly bound to the rusty pipes. She strains,
   tries to pull her hands from the chains, but they won't move.
   Above her on the pipe there is a old rusty bracket. Lilly
   blinks through the sweat running into her eyes. She moves the

   chains that bind her hands closer to the bracket and begins
   rubbing the chains against the bracket in the vain hope that
   she may be able to cut her way through the chains. She
   strains harder and harder, fighting back the tears, the fear,
   she just grinds at the chain repetitively.

   Cut to


104 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - DAY                           104

   Steph, in the hospital bed, her eyes staring up, hollow. A
   bed sheet is drawn over her dead face.

   Cut to


105 INT: HOSPITAL, VARIOUS - CONTINUING                         105

   We see Silus. Staring through a window into an office. In
   there we can see Jones. Jones is talking in a very animated
   manner to someone who is obviously a reporter. The reporter
   stares, like Jones, through the window towards Silus. Jones
   turns away, looking guilty.

   Cut to

   Bedlam in the hospital corridors. People screaming, being
   restrained. What is clear is that the virus Steph had has now
   broken out into a plague of biblical proportions. We see a
   DOCTOR standing in the middle of the hospital corridor, blood
   over his smock, in a state of pure shock.

   And we see Silus there. A perfect creature observing the
   chaos. As he stands there he can see a small child; a girl,
   maybe around five. Silus stares at the child. The girl is
   holding her mother's hand. Her mother lies on a cot, strapped
   down; there are many other cots filling the crowded hallway.
   Her mother is dead. The girl's dirty face is stained with
   tears. For a moment Silus wavers.

   Then he moves over to the girl. She    stares up at him with her
   tear stained grimy face. Silus goes    to place his hand on her
   forehead as blessing, but the child    cringes, then jumps up
   and escapes down the hallway. Silus    can only stare at the
   horror of it all.

    On a dirty, stained valve radio. We slowly track in on the
    speaker, hearing an interview coming from it.

                         REPORTER
                      (off)
               Some say this plague is the result

    Armed, gas masked guards stand with their guns at the ready.
    Beyond the blockade is Jamestown. Fires burn, bodies lie on
    the streets.

                         REPORTER
                      (off)

               They say the Queen has left the
               city... Is this martial law?

    A figure is stumbling towards us. One of the guards fires and
    the figure drops.

110 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY                     110

   There is an angry mob, banging on the locked doors of the
   brotherhood building. Their placards tell the tale. "Brothers
   have brought the plague." "No to Genetic experimentation."

                        EDGAR
                     (off)
              Do you like the world I am making
              for us, Silus? I haven't had your
              little policewoman yet. But I will
              soon. You'll just have to find me.
              You know where I am. Everything
              flows from me. Remember that...

   Human police stand ready with guns. It's a disaster. Silus is
   there. He watches the faces of the mob, baying for blood. He
   sees them burning the emblems of the brotherhood.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


111 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, AUGUSTUS' OFFICE - CONTINUING   111

   We are in a beautifully ornate office. It is like a private
   chapel. We see Silus enter. He is grim. Augustus is kneeling
   in prayer. He senses Silus.

                        AUGUSTUS
              The infection is spreading. Each
              day he shares his blood with more
              of them. Even though they are
              locked in their homes.
                                                                89




                   SILUS
         He is somewhere in the quarantine
         zone. I will find him.

Augustus turns to Silus. Augustus moves closer to him, stares
into Silus' strange, pale eyes.

                   AUGUSTUS
         Clear. So very clear your eyes.
         The way they were when you were
         born. There will be no search.

Augustus moves off to his desk. Silus is shocked.

                   SILUS
         No search?

                   AUGUSTUS
         The Queen has instructed the
         government to evacuate the city
         around the quarantine zone. In
         another day they will take action.

                   SILUS
         What kind of action?

                   AUGUSTUS
         Eradication. Of everything within
         the area. They will burn it all.
         Including Edgar.

                   SILUS
         And the innocents there, who are
         not infected?

                   AUGUSTUS
         It is a necessary step. We cannot
         let this escape.

                   SILUS
         No!

Augustus looks up at Silus; this is perhaps the first time
Silus has refused anything that Augustus has decreed.
                                                                     90




                       AUGUSTUS
             Is it the policewoman? Is this
             affecting your thinking? There is
             no love for our kind Silus. Only
             service.

                       SILUS
             We have done this. Released this
             thing into the world. We have
             betrayed their trust in us, more
             than once. I won't do it again.

                       AUGUSTUS
             There is no debate. They will be
             sacrificed, so the rest will be
             pure.

   Silus shakes his head.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             This policeman, Jones. He talked
             to the press. Told them this came
             from Edgar.

   Silus watches Augustus very carefully.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             There are members of the inner
             circle who question the way you
             have handled this. Blame you for
             this man's actions. I have made it
             clear that you will fix this. That
             you will silence him.

   Augustus moves close to Silus now. Gently touches his face.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             These are hard things we do. But
             you must think of the greater
             good. And of your own future.

   A light bulb flickering.


112 INT: JONES APARTMENT, HALL - NIGHT                         112

   Jones exits an elevator. The light above him flickers and
   dies. He stands in the dark.
                                                                      91




                       JONES
             Great.

   Jones begins to stomp down the hall, towards the part of the
   hall that is lit. Then pop, that light goes out as well.

   Jones stops. He pulls out his big gun from his armpit
   holster. He checks over his shoulder, and then with the gun
   extended he moves slowly forward. He approaches an area that
   opens up a little. He pauses, then under his breath.

                       JONES
                    (continuing)
             Come on then...

   He launches himself around the corner and fires his gun. He's
   lucky that his misses his target.

   A small, dirty, cowering boy with his fingers on the bank of
   light switches. The wall next to the boy's head has exploded;
   dust and wall board now drift down like snow.

   Jones can only stare at the quivering child whose dirty face
   blank with fright.

   Then Jones turns. He can make out a figure in the dark hall.
   A patient, quiet sentinel.


113 INT: JONES APARTMENT - NIGHT                                113

   Jones opens the door to his apartment and enters. Silus
   follows. The place is a dump. Lounge and kitchen all one
   area, bedroom off to one side, dishes in the sink, clothes
   everywhere. Jones heads into the kitchen and turns on a
   coffee machine, then grabs a dirty glass, pours a drink.
   Silus watches him.

   Jones comes into the lounge. He still has his gun in his
   hand. He stares at Silus, whose perfect outline makes Jones'
   life seem even more abysmal.

                       JONES
             What do you want?

                       SILUS
             I want to help you. They know you
             talked to the press.

                       JONES
             They can fuck off. For that
             matter, so can you.

   Jones takes a slurp on his drink.
                                                                92



                   JONES
                (continuing)
         You'd be the last person I'd trust.

                   SILUS
         Why?

                   JONES
         I saw you. Remember. Watching
         Lilly, when she was asleep.

Silus doesn't answer now. Jones moves forward.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Maybe you're just like your
         Brother. Maybe you're helping him.
         Now there's a thought.

Jones prods Silus' shoulder with the gun.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Do you know where she is?

Jones prods again and finds Silus' elegant steel fingers
around his wrist. The two men face off.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         You've changed. Not the outside.
         But inside. I know you. You know
         what, I can see myself?

Jones tries to wrench his wrist free, but Silus holds it
tight. Jones swings his free arm and smashes Silus on the
side of the face.

For a moment Silus doesn't move, then his hand is around
Jones' throat. Squeezing. Squeezing. His other hand wrenching
the gun from Jones' hand. There is silence in the room, apart
from Jones' choking gags. Then Silus pushes Jones back so
that he flies into a chair. Jones stares up at Silus now,
fear in his eyes. Silus watches him. Then a sound attracts
his attention.

Cut to

Water hisses from Jones' coffee machine in the kitchen.

                   JONES
                (continuing; sneering)
         Coffee's ready.

   Silus, turning, listening, focusing on the water dripping
   from the coffee machine. Silus is concentrating. Realization
   comes into his eyes.

   We zoom close to Silus' ear. The soundtrack becomes enhanced.

   Cut to

   The tap in Jones' festering sink, dripping; plop plop plop.
   We see the water in the bottom of the sink reflecting the
   room. We see Silus approaching; reflected there. His hand
   enters frame and touches the water. And we hear Edgar's
   voice, the words we heard him say in Augustus' office.

   We see Silus staring at the water. We see a giant drop of
   water hanging from the tap, hanging, hanging, then falling...

   Cut to


114 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - NIGHT                     114

   We are under water, liquid drops down into the water; red
   liquid, blood. We can see a figure distorted in the water;
   the figure is bleeding himself into the water. It is Edgar.

   Cut to

   We see a subterranean water system. We see Edgar at the edge
   of a pool, bleeding himself into the water supply. Edgar
   looks up. His eyes reflect at us, blinking like an animal's.

   Cut to

   Lilly in her cell, still grinding away at the chains that
   bind her hands. She stops, as if she's heard something,
   expecting Edgar to walk through the doorway. He doesn't. She
   begins desperately grinding away at the chains once more.

115 INT: JONES APARTMENT - CONTINUING                        115

   Back on Silus who now turns to Jones.

                       SILUS
             Do you have a map?

   Cut to
                                                                   94



   Jones laying out a map of the city on his kitchen table;
   empty booze bottles roll out of the way. Jones has a pen and
   he's marking off an area.

                       JONES
             There's the quarantine zone. It's
             a pit. Slums.

                       SILUS
             The water supply. Where is it?

   Jones searches and then pin points an area in the center of
   the quarantine zone.

                       JONES
             There, all the old suburbs are
             supplied by their own artesian
             wells. Mineral springs. That's why
             it hasn't broken out of Jamestown,
             it's the water. Jamestown's water.

   The two men stare at each other, both reaching the same
   conclusion.

                       SILUS
             He is there, with Lilly.

   We see the Map.


116 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT             116

   Cut to a crane down to reveal Silus and Jones observing the
   guards at the blockade.

                       JONES
             You'll never get in, they've
             circled the whole borough.

   Silus turns to Jones.

                       SILUS
             I will get in. You must go to the
             press. Tell them about the water.
             Tell them what the government will
             do.

                       JONES
             You're dead after this. You know
             that? Whatever happens.

   Silus smiles.

                       SILUS
             Watch for me, Officer Jones.
                                                                     95




    Silus exits. Jones watches him leave, then Jones leaves too.


117 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         117

    We see Silus, close. It's as if he is meditating. We pull out
    to reveal he is kneeling on the roof of a building; he looks
    as if he's preparing himself for something.

    He then rises, all fluid concentration, and runs towards us
    and then the camera is on his shoulder as he jumps off the
    roof.

    Cut to

    Silus' POV falling down down, falling towards a window then
    smashing through it.

118 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS     118

    Silus exploding onto the floor of the apartment. For a moment
    there is silence, just glass tinkling, Silus poised. Then
    Silus turns and is gone.

    Cut to


119 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         119

    The slums are wrapped in smoke and haze from fires that burn
    there; an eerie dead zone, made all the stranger by the
    gothic spires that climb out of the haze.

    Then Silus hears something. It is the wailing of a new born
    child. Silus moves towards the cries, then up ahead he sees
    a figure, kneeling on the ground. As Silus moves through the
    haze he sees what it is. It is a Brother Priest, kneeling
    beside someone. The Brother is holding the hand of the person
    on the ground who is in the last throws of death. When Silus
    is next to him the Priest looks up at him. Tears wet his
    cheeks. For a moment they just stare at each other.

                        PRIEST 2
              Who has done this, Brother?

                        SILUS
              We have. To our shame.
                                                                        96




    The Silus hears the babies cries again. Closer now. The
    Priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of
    him. Drops the limp hand he was holding. Then rises and turns
    squarely to Silus.

                        PRIEST 2
              I have something to show you.

    The Priest moves off towards a building and Silus follows.

    Cut to


119A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, HOVEL - CONTINUING    119A

    We see Silus and the Priest enter. The Priest leads Silus
    into the dark place. As he moves forward Silus can hear a
    strange gurgling sound; not of the sick or dying, this is a
    more innocent sound. The sounds of a newborn.

    We See Silus approach a filthy, roughly made crib. In it is
    a baby; it's eyes stare up at Silus with wisdom beyond their
    years.

                        PRIEST 2
              It is a miracle my Brother. She is
              a female, the first of our kind.

    Silus watches the baby carefully.

                        SILUS
              She must be protected.

    He then turns to the Priest.

                        SILUS
                     (continuing)
              I would ask for your help Brother.
              The Church can no longer be
              trusted...


119B EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                   119B

    Edgar, atop the roof of the building that sits above the
    water treatment plant. He is watching his handiwork; the
    screams in the night, the burning fires, the haze rising up,
    cloaking the city. Then down below, he sees a figure
    approaching. He knows who it is. Silus is coming to him.

    Cut to
                                                                   97




120 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          120

   Lilly, in her cell. She is working the chains that bind her
   hands against the pipe. She's rubbing them desperately,
   harder, harder. Then she stops. She can hear someone
   approaching.

   Edgar appears in the doorway; still and poised. Then he
   turns, listening. A creaking echoes through the tunnels as if
   an iron door, somewhere above, has been opened.

                       EDGAR
             He's coming little one. He's
             coming for you.

   Edgar takes one more blinking look at Lilly and then leaves,
   slamming the large iron door behind him.

   Lilly pulls at the chains, hoping against hope that they'll
   break. They don't.

                       LILLY
             No.

   She now looks above. The pipe her chains are connected to
   runs up towards the roof, then takes a bend to disappear into
   the wall near the door. She bangs on the pipe. There is a
   little movement where it goes into the wall. Just enough to
   give her some hope.

   Lilly struggles now to her feet. She slides the chains up. To
   get the chains over the bend she'll have to jump. She does,
   sliding the chain over the bend. Now she hangs from the pipe,
   the chains cutting into her wrists viciously, making her
   groan. She then gets her hands on the pipe and begins sliding
   along the pipe until she is near the door. She then reaches
   up with her feet and kicks at the wall, pushing, trying to
   dislodge the pipe. It moves, water leaks from it. But it does
   not give way.

   A desperate beat. Then she reaches down to the door with her
   foot. She tries to force down the door handle, her foot wet
   and slippery. Finally she gets the handle down, opens the
   door so that it clangs against the wall.

                       LILLY
                    (continuing)
             Hello! I'm down here. Silus...

   Her hands slip from the pipe and again the chains bite into
   her wrist. She cries out in pain.

   Cut to
                                                                     98


121 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                 121

    Above we see Silus, stopping. Lilly's cries echo through the
    place. It is a wet maze of grease and rust, ornate twisting
    pipes built long ago and now decrepit. Silus waits, listens.
    Then something.

    Cut to

    Feet, moving fast, splashing in a pool of black water.

    Silus turns, just catching a movement, a flash of someone
    moving off through the distorted piping. He moves to where he
    saw the figure, to catch sight of a person moving to an open
    iron doorway.

                        SILUS
              Lilly?

    But when the woman turns it is not Lilly. It is one of the
    infected; the red eyes, mad and staring at him. And both he
    and the creature hear it. Cries, of someone in pain. Lilly.

    Cut to


121A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121A

    Lilly's cries echo up the stairwell, up towards the surface.

121C INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT                             121C

    The creature moving through the doorway towards the sounds of
    Lilly's cries. Silus now moves forward to get to the
    creature, flying towards the doorway. We see him approaching
    the doorway and then from nowhere Edgar slams into Silus,
    sending them both careening over a railing.


121D INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121D

    Low Angle looking directly up at the two Brothers fall,
    bouncing and crashing off the rails on the way down.
                                                                       99




121E INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING       121E

    They both hit the wet stone floor. They are in the pipe room
    where subterranean mineral springs rise up from deep in the
    earth and where the boroughs water supply is sterilized.

    Silus is stunned, rises, blood issuing from his mouth. Silus
    pulls his gun from his coat, but Edgar's kick is too fast,
    whipping the gun away so that the glass instrument smashes
    against some dripping pipes. Edgar then squares off against
    Silus.

                        EDGAR
              It is a maze down here. But given
              time, that thing will find her. Do
              things to her. I'll show you where
              she is, if you take some.

    Edgar stalks forward. He holds up his arm to Silus.

    Silus stares at the tube coming from Edgar's arm. Edgar moves
    towards Silus, twisting on the tube so that his infected
    blood drips onto the ground.

                        EDGAR
                     (continuing)
              You're almost there anyway.

    And then Silus' face, intense, a dark smile, his hand now
    gripping Edgar's hand; surprise in Edgar's eyes.

    He pulls Edgar toward him with all his might, his hand
    clamping onto Edgar's throat - the power of the entwined
    bodies immense - then Edgar whipping his body, breaking
    Silus' grip, smashing Silus on the side of the head, but then
    only to get a kick from Silus directly in the stomach that
    sends him smashing into several protruding pipes, ripping
    into his back. Edgar screams.
                                                                   100



122 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          122

   Lilly. Half conscious now, hanging from the pipe above her,
   twisting. The sound of Edgar's screams makes her groan,
   awaken a little, dazed. Then there is a loud clang. She
   cranes her head to see down the tunnel that leads to her
   cell. She catches sight of a shadow, movement in the tunnel.

                        LILLY
             Silus...
                                                                101


Then the figure moves into the tunnel, shuffling, the legs
not completely following the brains instructions, but doing
enough to propel the person forward, then a stumble. And in
a shaft of light Lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet
wall. But it is less a hand than a claw. And the face that
follows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half
mad, the infected. The thing catches sight of Lilly, then
propels itself towards her.

We see it's POV, approaching faster, faster.

And Lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling
to hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching
the door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is
almost on her. Then she stretches out with her foot, just
catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that
is about to attack her.

The thing on the other side of the door is now screaming
wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature
tries to activate it and Lilly has her feet on it, trying
desperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep
slipping. And then she realizes that the pipe from which she
hangs is beginning to wobble - water is now coursing from the
hole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. Her
feet slip more and more on the door.

Lilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too
slippery and the thing is pushing through the door. In the
dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands
grasping for Lilly legs, scratching at them, Lilly twisting,
the creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs.
Lilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe
she's attached to. The thing below her is groaning
incoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, Lilly
pulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below
her, wanting her. Lilly tries to pull herself higher. And
then she feels it. The pipe she's attached to is shifting,
where it joins the wall. Water is now flooding from it, the
pipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way.

The creature's fingers are now able to grasp Lilly's t-shirt,
drag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water
flowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe
bursting out of the wall.

Lilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature.

For a moment neither of them move, then the creature is
grabbing at Lilly's hair, pulling her head back. In a flash
Lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the
face of the creature. This gives her time to stagger upright.

She's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of
the pipe near the door.
                                                                        102




    She begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to
    rise and advance towards her. Lilly desperately slides the
    chain along the pipe. It catches on a protrusion, while the
    creature advances. Lilly frees it just in time, falling
    backwards as the creature jumps at her, Lilly lifting the
    chain up to hold the creature back. The creature strains to
    get at Lilly. Lilly now has the chain at the creature's neck.
    She begins to tighten it around the creature's neck, her only
    hope now. The creature changes now, from frightening to
    pitiful as it realizes it can't breath, it's fingers
    desperately moving over Lilly's face, almost pleading. Tears
    form in Lilly's eyes as she tightens the stranglehold; there
    is no anger there, just desperation, and behind that, pity.

    The creature breathes it's last breath then collapses onto
    Lilly.

124A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING        124A

    Edgar and Silus stalk each other in the steam room. Edgar
    launches himself towards Silus, but Silus is now too quick.
    Silus slams Edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of Edgar's
    face left on the pipe.
                                                                103




Stunned Edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, Silus rising
now, he has him. Again, Silus slams Edgar's head into another
pipe. And now Silus has Edgar's throat in his fist and the
look on Silus' face tells Edgar he will not escape.

We see Edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying.
Steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. Then
behind Silus, Edgar can make something out. An old, corroded
tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. There are a
series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube
and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for
sterilizing bottles.

With a last effort Edgar propels Silus backwards onto one of
the shafts, making Silus grimace and clutch his back where
he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. The piercing has
operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the
wound on Silus' back.

Cut to

Silus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it.

And now Edgar above him. He removes one of the sterilizer
shafts from the bracket that holds it. He clutches a lever on
the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end
of the shaft. Edgar moves slowly towards Silus.

We see Silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's
stopped by more pipes behind him. Nowhere to go.

And Edgar ready to pounce. He does, driving the shaft towards
Silus' head. Silus manages to raise one hand to Edgar's wrist
to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. Now the shaft is
right in Silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back
at Silus. Edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of
the shaft, ready to get some steam going.

                   EDGAR
         If I burn the skin from your face,
         I wonder how that would be. If you
         looked like a monster...

Cut to

Edgar's finger moving over the steaming lever. The steaming
end of the shaft right in Silus' face.

Then Edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the
last time.

The blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the
shaft drifts into our frame.

Cut to Silus. His face is not scolded.
                                                                     104




   Cut back to Edgar, his expression getting tighter, his face
   redder, the whites of his eyes becoming bloodshot. Then he
   goes to speak, but now words come out, only a swirling puff
   of steam.

   And then he falls and we see behind him, standing there is
   Lilly, one of the other sterilizing shafts in her hand; steam
   still rising from the sharp end of it.

   Cut to Edgar, prone, on the wet floor of the pipe room; steam
   rises from both his mouth and the back of his head.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


125 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT               125

   POV steadicaming through the streets of the Quarantine zone.

   The POV belongs to Lilly who moves down the street, half
   carrying Silus who limps. Lilly takes in the devastation.
   Then Silus pulls up.

                       LILLY
             What is it?

                         SILUS
             In there.

   Silus is pointing to a fallen down building through the haze
   and the rain.

                       LILLY
             Is there something wrong?

                         SILUS
             No.

   He gently touches her mud smeared face.

                       SILUS
                    (continuing)
             There is something very precious.
             You must take it, keep it secret.
             Don't let them touch it.

                       LILLY
             I don't understand.

                         SILUS
             You will.
                                                                      105




   And then they both hear it. A wail, distorted, echoing; it
   sounds like a hurt animal. Lilly looks at Silus.

                         SILUS
                      (continuing)
             Hurry.

   Lilly turns towards the building. She slowly moves towards
   it, into the doorway as Silus watches her go. Silus turns to
   the sunrise, it reflects in his eyes.

   Cut to


126 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, BUILDING, NIGHT       126

   Lilly moves through the derelict place, past fallen beams. It
   seems empty. Then Lilly hears it again. A wail. This time she
   knows what it is; we can tell from the way her eyes glisten.

   She moves forward, closer to the sound. And finally she sees
   the Brother Priest we saw before, who kneels in front of a
   crate. He looks up at her as she approaches.

   As Lilly moves forward she sees what lies with the crate.
   Wrapped in dirty sacking, there is a baby.

   In the corner Lilly can see a woman - the child's mother -
   dead from the infection.

   The baby cries and Lilly can see the tiny fangs of a Brother
   in the baby's mouth.

                       PRIEST 2
             The first female of her kind. The
             first daughter given to us.

   Lilly moves forward. Emotional music rises in the soundtrack;
   evoking memory, the circle completing. Lilly reaches out,
   letting the baby girl grip her hand. Lilly reaches into the
   crate, drawing the baby into her arms, staring down into the
   baby's face; a face somehow already wise, already serene.
   Broken tears run down Lilly's cheek as she presses the baby
   to herself, all the pain of the past flooding over her, the
   baby's tiny hands reaching out, clasping onto her.

                       PRIEST 2
                    (continuing)
             Come. Before they find her.

127 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - DAWN                 127

   Lilly exits the building. She looks around for Silus, but he
   has gone. She pauses. Through the mist and drifting smoke
   from the fires we can see that in the distance a tarnished
   sun is lighting the horizon.

                       PRIEST 2
             We must go.

   After a final pause Lilly moves off with the Priest, carrying
   the tiny bundle with her.

                         LILLY
                         (VO)
              For me, everything has changed now.
              Because of Silus I see the world
              through new eyes.

                                            FADE OUT:


128 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              128

   Silus, on a fire escape, in the shadows. Gone are the clothes
   of the Brotherhood, rather he is dressed as someone who does
   not want to be seen.

   Cut to his POV. We see Lilly's building. We see through the
   window, into her apartment; a beacon of warmth in the night.

   In Lilly's bed we can see the baby, its hands happily making
   patterns before its eyes.

                        LILLY
                        (VO)
              Now I see hope, and I see a child,
              the first female of her kind.



   Silus scans the apartment.

   He can see the lounge. Jones is there with Lilly. Lilly is
   dressed to go out; to leave. Jones and Lilly hug. Then Jones
   picks up two suitcases and moves towards the door.

   Silus watches as Lilly moves into the bedroom and reaches
   down for the tiny baby, its tiny arms clasping onto her as
   she lifts it.

                       LILLY
                       (VO)
              Perhaps Edgar got what he wanted
              after all, because it time this
              child will truly change our world.
                                                                107


We see Silus, closer, watching.

Cut to

Lilly, pausing, moving to the window of her apartment,
staring out into the night, almost directly toward Silus. She
raises her hand, as if in a gesture of goodbye and then she
leaves.

Cut to

Silus, close, nodding.

                          Will...!

               [Elizabeth runs to Will]

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Why is this happening? 

                                     WILL TURNER
                         I don't know. You look beautiful.

                         I think it's bad luck for the groom 
                         to see the bride before the wedding.

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been 
                         too long.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         His Lord now... actually.

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The 
                         warrant for the arrest of one William 
                         Turner.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. 
                         Arrest her.
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         On what charges?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         No!

               [Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing 
               with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail]
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner. 
                         And I have another one for a Mister 
                         James Norrington. Is he present?
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         *What are the charges?*

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         I don't believe that's the answer to 
                         the question I asked.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Lord Beckett! In the category of questions 
                         *not* answered...
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         We are under the jurisdiction of the 
                         King's governor of Port Royal, and you 
                         will tell us what we are charged with. 
                         
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         For which the punishment, regrettably, 
                         is *also* death. Perhaps you remember 
                         a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
 
                         
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         *Captain* Jack Sparrow.

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought 
                         you might.

                         Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink 
                         and the devil had done for the rest. 
                         Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

               across the bridge by guards]
 
               [a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in 
               a cage, the crow attacks and pecks his eye out, he screams]
 
               
               [the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch-like 
               door in the ground, he also screams]

               [men toss caskets into the sea]

               [numerous caskets are floating out to sea, vertical streaks in 
               the distant clouds are seen]
 
               [a crow lands on one casket, begins pecking at the top] 

               [sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away, 
               along with much wood]
 
               [hand holding flintlock pistol emerges, pans about, points it 
               at audience for a moment]
 
               [Jack breaks out of the top of the casket, puts his captain's 
               hat on]

                         Sorry, mate.

               [Jack breaks the skeleton's leg off]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Mind if we make a little side trip? 
                          I didn't think so.
 
               [Jack uses the skeleton leg as an oar, rows toward the full moon 
               and a waiting ship in the distance to the right of the moon]

                         Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.

                         Captain, I think the crew, meaning me 
                         as well, were expecting something a 
                         bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla 
                         de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed 
                         by the sea, and the treasure with it.

                         the Atlantic.

                         And the hurricane!

               Aye.

                                     CREW
                         Aye.

               Aye.

                         All in all, it's seems some time since 
                         we did a speck of honest pirating.

                         Aye, shiny.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Is that how you're all feeling, then? 
                         Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving 
                         your best interests as captain?
 
                                     COTTON'S PARROT
                         Awk! Walk the plank!  

               [Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         What did the bird say?

                                     LEECH
                         Do not blame the bird. Show us what 
                         is on that piece of cloth there. 
 
                         
               [the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it]
 
               
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Ohhh!

               [Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol 
               misfires]
 
               [Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey 
               while it's on the deck]
 
               [the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into 
               the rigging]

                         It does me.

               [Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped]

                                     MARTY
                         It's a key!

                         No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* 
                         of a key. 
 
               [Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]

                         Gentlemen, what do keys do?

                                     LEECH
                         Keys... unlock... *things*? 

                                     GIBBS
                         And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* 
                         there's something valuable. So, we're 
                         setting out to find whatever this key 
                         unlocks!
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         No! If we don't have the key, we can't 
                         open whatever it is we don't have that 
                         it unlocks. So what purpose would be 
                         served in finding whatever need be unlocked, 
                         which we don't have, without first having 
                         found the key what unlocks it?

                         So - We're going after this key!

                         You're not making any sense at all. 
                         Any more questions?

                         Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm...

                         Come on, snap to and make sail, you 
                         know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, 
                         ?oy/?quick, hey!

                         seems to be actin' a bit strange... 
                         -er.

                         headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. 
                         Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack 
                         Sparrow bodes ill for us all.

                         The East India Trading Company has need 
                         of your services.  We wish for you to 
                         act as our agent in a business transaction 
                         with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
 
                         
                                     WILL TURNER
                         More acquaintance than friend. How do 
                         you know him?
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         We've had dealings in the past.  And 
                         we've each left our mark... on the other. 
                         
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         What mark did he leave on you? 

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set 
                         free. I would like you to go to him, 
                         and recover a certain property in his 
                         possession.

                         Recover. At the point of a sword?

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         *Bargain*!

               [Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]
 
               
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Letters of Marque. You will offer what 
                         amounts to a full pardon. Jack will 
                         be free, a privateer in the employ of 
                         England.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment 
                         the same as being free.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                          Freedom.  Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. 
                          The world is shrinking, the blank pages 
                         of the map filled in. Jack must find 
                         his place in the new world or perish. 
                         Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and 
                         your fiancée face the hangman's noose. 
                         
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         So you get both Jack *and* the Black 
                         Pearl.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         The Black Pearl?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         The property you want that he possesses.
 
                         
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         A ship? Hardly. The item in question's 
                         considerably smaller and far more valuable. 
                         Something Sparrow keeps on his person 
                         at all times. A compass.  Ah, you know 
                         it. Bring back that Compass, or there's 
                         no deal.

                         I thought not. If it were, there'd be 
                         rum.

                         is no longer the currency of the realm, 
                         as your father believes.

                         I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency 
                         of the realm.
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN

                         sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.

                         bear my signature and my seal.

                         Or else I would not still be here. You 
                         sent Will to get you the Compass owned 
                         by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.

                         I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have 
                         seen the treasure myself. There is something 
                         you need to know.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads 
                         only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you 
                         hope to *save* me from an evil fate. 
                         But you mustn't worry. I care not for 
                         cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not 
                         so provincial. There's more than one 
                         chest of value in these waters. So perhaps 
                         you may wish to enhance your offer.

                         you robbed me of my wedding night.

                         So I did. A marriage interrupted.  Or 
                         fate intervenes. You make great efforts 
                         to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

                         These aren't going to Jack.

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's 
                         freedom, then? I'll still want that 
                         Compass. Consider that in your calculations.

                         Have you considered keeping a more watchful 
                         eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.

                         I need that Compass of yours, Jack. 
                         I must trade it for her freedom.

                         the finding this finds you incapacitorially

                         What's all this? If you both fancy the 
                         dress, you'll just have to share, and 
                         wear it one after the other.

                         It's not like that, Sir. This ship is 
                         haunted.

                         it. 
 
               The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. 
               Searching for her husband, lost at sea. 
 
               A virgin, too, likely as not.

               And that bodes ill by all accounts.

                                     BURSAR
                         I say... that we throw the dress overboard, 
                         and we hope the spirit finds it.

                         spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find 
                         out what the spirit needs, and then 
                         just get it back!

                         goats and it's got the best of you. 
                         Now this appears to be no more as we 
                         have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, 
                         by the look of it. I want you to search 
                         the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... 
                         she's probably naked.

                         that suction your face clean off. And 
                         drag an entire ship past the crushing

                         roar of the Kraken, and the reeking

                         is your purpose here?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his 
                         debt.
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted 
                         to accept that offer.

               in front of Jack and his spyglass]

                         Oh.

                                     DAVY JONES
                         You have a debt to pay. You've been 
                         captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen 
                         years. *That* was our agreement.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Technically, I was only captain for 
                         two years, then I was viciously mutinied 
                         upon.
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         Then you were a poor captain, but a 
                         *captain* nonetheless! Have you not 
                         introduced yourself all these years 
                         as *Captain* Jack Sparrow? 
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You have my payment. One soul to serve 
                         on your ship is already over there.
 
                         
                                     DAVY JONES
                         One soul is not equal to another.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Aha! So we've established my proposal 
                         is sound in principle, now we're just 
                         haggling over price. 
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         Price? Pttt!

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Just how many souls do you think my 
                         soul is worth?
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         One hundred souls, three days-uh.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You're a diamond, mate. Send me back 
                         the boy, I'll get started right off. 
                         
 
               [Maccus blocks Jack from exiting]

                                     DAVY JONES
                         I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. 
                         That leaves you only ninety-nine more 
                         to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! 
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, 
                         heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at 
                         least four... maybe three and a half. 
                         And did I happen to mention... he's 
                         in love. With a girl. Due to be married. 
                         Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and 
                         her from him... would only be half as 
                         cruel as actually allowing them be joined 
                         in holy matrimony. Aye?
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. 
                         But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live 
                         with this? Can you condemn an innocent 
                         man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of 
                         servitude, in your name while you roam 
                         free?
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                          Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal 
                         it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?
 
                         
               [Jones grabs Jack's hand, resulting in a squishy sound]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Uh!

                                     DAVY JONES
                         Three days.  Three days.

               of Jones' ship]
 
               [Jack looks at his hand, it's covered with slime, but the black 
               spot disappears under the effect of the slime]
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oh, Mr. Gibbs.

                                     GIBBS
                         Aye.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.

                         And how do you intend to harvest these 
                         ninety-nine souls in three days?
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Fortunately, he was mum as the condition 
                         in which these souls need be.

                         us, pilotage. Are we all to work for

                         A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, 
                         I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what 
                         I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep

                         No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*? 
                         I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I 
                         would have, if not for the... hurricane.

                         So do I make your crew, or not? You 
                         haven't said where you're going. Somewhere 
                         *nice*!

                         Jack Sparrow?

                         Or should I just kill you now?

               [Jack ducks back and forth behind both sides of a large post, 
               as Norrington points his pistol at Jack]

                                     NORRINGTON
                         Sorry. Old habits and all that.

               [unidentifed man, to Norrington] Easy, sonny!

                         Time to go?

                                     GIBBS
                         Aye!

               [someone throws a bottle against the wall above the stairs, Jack 
               ducks as it smashes above his head]

               Heave!

                         the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the 
                         heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, 
                         or there'll be no captain. And if there's 
                         no captain, there's no one to have the

                         nothing. I happen to have no dress in

                         and *entirely* unforeseeable series 
                         of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever 
                         to do with me, poor William has been 
                         press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.

                         doing here?

                         You *hired* me. I can't help it if your 
                         standards are lax.

                         want most?

                         Because I would think, you'd want to 
                         find a way to *save* Will the most.

                         Well, there is a chest...

                         Oh, dear.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         A chest of unknown size and origin.

                         What contains the still-beating heart 
                         o' Davy Jones.

                         And whoever possesses that chest possesses 
                         the leverage to command Jones to do 
                         whatever it is he or she wants, including... 
                         saving brave William from his grim fate.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         True enough. This Compass does not point 
                         north.

                         It points to the thing you want most 
                         in this world.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Every word, love. And what you want 
                         most in this world is to find the chest 
                         of Davy Jones, is it not?

                         By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

                         There's something to knowing the exact 
                         shape of the world and one's place in 
                         it, don't you agree?
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         I had you brought here because I thought 
                         you'd be interested in the whereabouts 
                         of your daughter.

                         Including the previous owner of this 
                         sword...  I believe. Our ships are in 
                         pursuit. and justice will be dispensed 
                         by cannonade and cutlass,  and all manner 
                         of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally 
                         find it distasteful to even contemplate 
                         the horror facing all those on board.

                         Beckett wants the Compass. Only one 
                         reason for that.

                         Of course. He wants the chest.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Yes, he did say something about a chest.

                         If the company controls the chest, they 
                         controls the sea.

                         And bad. Bad for every mother's son 
                         what calls himself a pirate. I think 
                         there's a bit more speed to be coaxed 
                         from these sails. Brace the foreyard!

                         Might I inquire how as to how you came 
                         by these?

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Decidedly not.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Will strikes a deal for these and upholds 
                         it with honor. Yet you're the one standing 
                         here with the prize. Full pardon, commission 
                         as a privateer on behalf of England 
                         and the East India Trading Company. 
                         As if I could be bought for such a low 
                         price.

                         Jack, the Letters, give them back.
 
                         
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         No. Persuade me.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         You do know Will taught me how handle 
                         a sword. 
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         As I said... Persuade me.

                         It's a curious thing. There was a time 
                         when I would've given anything for you 
                         to look like that while thinking about 
                         me.

                         I don't know what you mean.

                                     NORRINGTON
                         Oh, I think you do.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's 
                         all.

                          So you never wondered how your *latest* 
                         fiancé ended up on the Flying Dutchman 
                         in the first place?

                         Strange thing to come upon a longboat 
                         so far out in open waters.

                         you can. As fast as you can.

                         That dress. Where did you get it?

                         It was found aboard the ship. The crew 
                         it thought it was a spirit bringing 
                         some omen of ill fate.

                         That's foolish.

                         It brought good fortune! The spirit 
                         told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we 
                         made a nice bit of profit there.

                         jumped ship there.

                         to resist.

                         Why doesn't your Compass work? 

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Uh my Compass works fine.  

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Because you and I *are* alike, and there 
                         will come a moment when you have a chance 
                         to show it. To do the right thing.
 
                         
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         I *love* those moments. I like to wave 
                         at them as they pass by.
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         You'll have the chance to do something... 
                         something courageous. And when you do, 
                         you'll discover something: that you're 
                         a good man.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW

                         Curiosity. You're going to want it. 
                         A chance to be admired. And gain the 
                         rewards that follow. You won't be able 
                         to resist. You're going to want to know... 
                         what it tastes like.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         I *do* want to know what it tastes like.

                         know you will *never* put me in a position 
                         that would compromise my honor.

                         for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! 
                         Let's just - *pull* out our swords and 
                         start *banging* away at each other! 
                         *This will solve everything!* I've had 
                         it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, 
                         rum-soaked... *pirates*! 
 
               [Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far 
               to the left of them]
 
                                     PINTEL
                         How'd this go all screwy?

                                     
                         Enough!)

                                     RAGETTI
                         Well, each wants the chest for hisself, 
                         don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think 
                         he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old 
                         Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his 
                         own skin. And Turner there - I figure 
                         'e's tryna... settle some unresolved 
                         business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed 
                         pirate father. 
 
                                     PINTEL
                         Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n 
                         a shiny penny. 
 
                                     RAGETTI
                         Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
 
                         
                                     PINTEL
                         If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd 
                         remove temptation from their path.
 
                         
               [Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]
 
               
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Will! *Enough!*

               [Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion]

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Oh! Oh...! The heat!

               [Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]

               [Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, 
               oblivious to her]
 
               [Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]

               [Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the 
               chest]
 
               [Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]

               [various duel scenes on the beach]

               Bugger!

               [Norrington kicks sand in Will's face]

                                     NORRINGTON
                         By your leave, Mister Turner.

               [Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill]

               [the crew of Flying Dutchman emerge from the shallows]

               [one crewmember holds chain shot as a weapon]

               [Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up 
               to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2] 
 
               [Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks 
               Norrington back down with his foot] 
 
               [Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]
 
               
               [Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, 
               and carries Will upward, who just arrived]
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
 
                         
               [the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and 
               look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]
 
               [while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack 
               deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]
 
               
               [noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with 
               Jack]
 
               [soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword 
               is flung onto the ground below]
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                          Do excuse me while I kill the man who 
                         ruined my life.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Be my guest.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Let us examine that claim for a moment, 
                         former Commodore, shall we? Who was 
                         it, who at the very moment you had a 
                         notorious pirate safely behind bars, 
                         saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take 
                         your dearly beloved all to hisself, 
                         hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, 
                         that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand 
                         what takes orders from pirates?
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                         Enough!

               [Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to 
               Will]
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                         Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's 
                         *right*!
 
               [Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]
 
               
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Still rooting for you, mate!

               [Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around 
               his neck]
 
               [Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave] 
 
               
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Wup!

               [Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oh.

               [Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
 
               
               [the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling 
               on top]
 
               [Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed 
               wheel rolling behind him]
 
               [the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly 
               towards Jack]
 
               [the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the 
               inside of the wheel]
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Woah!

               [the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
 
               
               [Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling 
               inside the rolling wheel]
 
               [Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar 
               inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel] 
 
               [Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each 
               holding one side, giggling]
 
               [Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them, 
               halts, panting]
 
               [Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]
 
               
               [Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone]

                         'Ello, Poppet.

               [Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats 
               while facing them]
 
               [they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with 
               the duel on top]
 
               [Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get 
               the key that is still inside]

               [suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to 
               Elizabeth]
 
               [all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes 
               toward them]
 
               [swordfight ensues with the Flying Dutchmen crew and Pintel and 
               Ragetti]

               top of the wheel]
 
               [the wheel continues on, Jack hangs from the frond, then drops 
               to the ground]

               [Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the 
               small chest]
 
               [Jack picks up a coconut, whirls it a moment, then throws it 
               at Hadrus]
 
               [Hadrus' (conch shell) head is knocked off by the coconut]

               [Hadrus' head lies on the ground, attempting to give orders to

                         my voice! Follow my voice! To the left, 
                         uh... No, to the right... Go to the 
                         left...

                         Oh, shut it.

               [Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts 
               suddenly protrude when opened]

               [crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart 
               into his vest]

                         him to hit something with.

                         She's only a ship, mate.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         He's right, we have to head for land.

                                     WILL TURNER
                         We have to try. We can get away as it 
                         takes down the Pearl.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Thank you, Jack.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         We're not free yet, love.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         You came back. I always knew you were 
                         a good man.
 
               [Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack] 

               [Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters]

                                     GIBBS
                         Prepare to cast off! There's no time 
                         to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
 
               [the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth 
               has chained Jack to the main mast]
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         It's after you, not the ship. It's not 
                         us. This is the only way, don't you 
                         see? I'm not sorry.
 
               [Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                          Pirate.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         He elected to stay behind to give us 
                         a chance.
 
               [the crew look uncertain]

               earlier-eaten hat to the deck]

                         Not so bad.

               [Jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet]

                                     JACK SPARROW

               his face]

                         None. But... one of the ships did pick 
                         up a man adrift at sea. He had these.

                    A Fairytale by Gary Ross




     October 7, 1996




     "He was part of my dream of course 
     but then I was part of his dream too."

                      - Lewis Carroll "Through the looking glass"






	FADE IN:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. DAY.

	A college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high
	school seniors about their future.

				COLLEGE COUNSELOR
		... For those of you going on to college
		next year, the chance of finding a good
		job will actually decrease by the time
		you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop
		from thirty-one to twenty-six percent,
		and the median income for those jobs
		will go down as well ...

	There is some rustling in the audience.

				COLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT)
		Obviously, my friends, it's a
		competitive world and good grades are
		your only ticket through. By the year
		Two Thousand  ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS.

	A different teacher lectures a different class of students.

				HEALTH TEACHER
		... The chance of contracting HIV from a
		promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one
		in one hundred and fifty. The odds of
		dying in an auto accident are only one
		in twenty-five hundred.
			(beat)
		Now this marks a drastic increase ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS.

	Same angle. Different teacher.

				SCIENCE TEACHER
		... From just four years ago when ozone
		depletion was at ten percent of its
		current level. By the time you are
		twenty years old, average global
		temperature will have risen two and a
		half degrees. Even a shift of one
		degree can cause such catastrophic
		consequences as typhoons, floods,
		widespread drought and famine.

	REVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS.

	They stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID
	WAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth.
	Nobody moves ...

				SCIENCE TEACHER
			(chipper classroom tone)
		Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?

								CUT TO:

	1958.

	Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are
	neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet
	stillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in
	beautiful BLACK AND WHITE.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS)
		Honey, I'm home.

	SUBURBAN HOME.

	GEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the
	coatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer
	with a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that
	doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a
	tour guide at Disneyland.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)
		Hello darling.

	WIDER.

	MRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her
	apron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and
	concrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a
	fresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek.

				BETTY
		How was your day?

				GEORGE
		Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said
		that if things keep going the way they
		are, I might be seeing that promotion
		sooner than I thought.

				BETTY
		Oh darling that's wonderful!
			(an adoring gaze)
		I always knew you could do it.

	WAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	1996 -- (LIVING COLOR)

	DAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on
	a sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big
	smile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants,
	black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly
	... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never
	taking his eyes off the show.

				GEORGE (OS)
			(on T.V.)
		Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell?
			(sniffing)
		Is that your meat loaf?

				DAVID
			(by rote)
		"It might be ..."

				BETTY (OS)
			(shy smile)
		It might be.

	He leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek.

				GEORGE (OS)
		Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to
		this man's heart.

	There is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles
	wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when
	his real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)
		... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the
		deal

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand.
	Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix
	her age.

				DAVID'S MOM
		No--you have custody the first weekend
		of every month and this is the first
		weekend ...
			(pause)
		I don't care if yesterday was the
		thirtieth, this is still the first
		weekend.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the
	show.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)
		No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to
		go to La Costa ...
			(beat)
		Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's
		really my business, isn't it?

	He reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at
	an unnaturally high volume.

				GEORGE
			(on T.V.)
		Hey. Where are those kids?

				DAVID
			(reciting--a little louder)
		"Right behind you father."

				BUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER
			(on T.V.)
		Right behind you father.

	RESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE)

	The Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the
	foyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud
	has on a Letterman's sweater.

				MARYSUE
		Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little
		surprise for you.

				BETTY
		What's that Bud?

	Bud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue
	ribbon.

				BUD
		First prize at the science fair. There
		were lots of swell projects--guess mine
		was just the "swellest".

				BETTY
		Darling that's wonderful. Except there's
		no such word as "swellest".

				BUD
		Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the
		"English" fair.

	There is another jarring LAUGH TRACK.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He smiles right along with it. David stares transfixed at the
	set despite the continuing conversation in the other room.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)
		Well sure they can stay by themselves,
		Barry, but that's not the point. You
		said you'd take them.
			(beat)
		Well fine--they'll stay by themselves
		then.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		What's a mother to do?

				BETTY(OS)
			(on T.V.)
		Oh--what's a mother to do?

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He grabs another handful of Doritos staring at the T.V ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. (SERIES OF SHOTS) DAY.

	A cacophony of modem life. Beepers and nose rings--blue hair
	and tattoos. Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another.
	The hormones are running crazy.

	SCHOOL COURTYARD.

	lt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime. Groups of kids
	hang out together, divided by their various cliques. The
	music pounds in the background.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link
	fence. Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks
	to someone in front of him.

				DAVID
		Hi. I mean ...
			(pause)
		... Hi.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him. It's a warm,
	welcoming smile.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID
		Look. You probably don't think I should
		be asking you this. I mean--not knowing
		you well and all ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She smiles wider at him, inviting him to continue.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID
			(pause ...)
		I mean I know you--everybody knows you
		... I just don't know you ...
		technically.

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She nods at him ...

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID
		Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see
		you all the time in Algebra and I heard
		you humming that Van Halen song and I
		really like that song too ...
			(pause)
		Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing
		this weekend but my Mom's leaving town
		and she said I could use her car so ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She positively beams. The girl flicks her blonde hair and
	stares back at him adoringly.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	Instead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the
	ground.

	WIDE ANGLE. SCHOOLYARD.

	For the first time WE SEE THAT SHE WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.
	David stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard,
	rehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to
	face with a much cooler boy. He has a cell phone and a very
	hip haircut.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	David watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's
	waist and heads out of the playground ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. "LUNCHEON COURT". DAY.

	David and his friends are all gathered around the plastic
	picnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon
	court. The chess club meets at one end and there are some
	teachers at the other. All the cool kids are on the other
	side of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the
	same table every day.

				HOWARD
		Okay, whose window did Bud break when he
		was playing with his father's golf
		clubs?

				DAVID
		Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr.
		Jenkins have?

	Howard looks at him, puzzled.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name
		the cat they found in the gutter?

				HOWARD
		Scout?

				DAVID
		Marmalade.

	They all nod--and murmur with admiration.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Okay--here's one: Why did their parents
		come home early from their weekend at
		the lake?

	Everybody thinks.

	Nobody knows.

				DAVID (CONT)
		'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and
		they were worried about him.

	It's quiet for a beat.

				HOWARD
		You're unbelievable. You'll win this
		thing for sure. When is it on?

				DAVID
		Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's
		tomorrow at noon.

				HOWARD
			(weighing it)
		A thousand dollars ... And it's on all
		night?

				DAVID
		Of course it is Howard. That's why they
		call it a Marathon.

								CUT TO:

	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

	David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the
	parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same
	uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T
	shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car
	hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the
	prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all
	look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends
	are hanging out.

				KIMMY
		Omigod, it's so mortifying, being
		related to him. I can't believe you're
		like--

				JENNIFER
		Only on my parent's side.

				KIMMY
		I know, but you're like ... twins and
		stuff.
			(beat)
		You must be from like, the cool side of
		the uterus.

	A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They
	bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen
	year olds. The girls freeze when they see them.

				KIMMY (CONT)
		Omigod, omigod--here they come.

				CHRISTIN
		Don't do anything. Just don't like--do
		anything ...

				JENNIFER
			(cooly)
		Hi Mark.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously
	off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young
	racehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole
	parking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his
	lackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan
	Pathfinder like a small summit conference.

				MARK
			(to Jennifer)
		Hey.

				JENNIFER
			(right back)
		Hey.

	Beat ...

				MARK'S LACKEYS
			(to Jennifer's lackies)
		Hey.

				JENNIFER'S LACKEYS
			(back to them)
		Hey.

				MARK
		Saw you at the mall yesterday.

				JENNIFER
		Yeah ... Saw you too.

	Everyone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV
		tonight?

				MARK
		Yeah.
			(beat)

	Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement.

				JENNIFER
		My mom'll be out of town.

	Kimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys
	mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost
	on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.

				MARK
		So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...

				JENNIFER
			(smiling)
		Cool.

				MARK
			(nodding faster)
		Cool.

				VARIOUS LACKEYS
		Cool.

	Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods,
	summoning his flock.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK.

	lt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver." The
	uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There
	is a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have
	the same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of
	hell.

				JENNIFER (VO)
		... I know, I know--He's just like so
		FINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod."

	INT. WAGNER HOME.

	lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so
	at night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the
	cordless phone attached to her ear.

				JENNIFER
		It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like:
		"Well my Mom'll be out of town." And
		he's like "Well then, maybe we could--
		you know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure."
		And he's like "Well, cool."
			(beat)
		I know, he's just so smart.
			(pause ...)
		I don't know. Maybe that black thing I
		just got.
			(pause ...)
		It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute.
			(pause ... )
		Well, "hello?" He's not coming  over
		here to study ...
			(beat)
		I know. Well I'm jealous of you too
		sometimes.

	INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM.

	lt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful
	either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside
	with a cordless phone in his hand.

				DAVID
		... He's not homeless Howard, they just
		don't say where he lives.
			(pause ...)
		Well it's a silly question.
			(pause ...)
		Because nobody's homeless in
		Pleasantville.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her
	Mercedes.

				DAVID
		... because that's just not what it's
		like.

	She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway...

				DAVID (CONT)
		Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty.
		I gotta go.

	INT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM.

	The huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the
	room. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making
	a B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from
	the other direction, fiddling with her clothes.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	They hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at
	exactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at
	each other in shock.

				JENNIFER
			(stunned)
		What are you doing?

				DAVID
		What are you doing?

	Neither one moves. They clutch the remote together.

				JENNIFER
		David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna
		like be here in five minutes.

				DAVID
		Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon
		starts at six thirty.

				JENNIFER
		Pleasantville Marathon?

				DAVID
			(almost reverently)
		Yeah. Every episode ever.

				JENNIFER
			(getting hysterical)
		Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's
		gonna like beeeee here!

				DAVID
		Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.

				JENNIFER
		Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any
		STEREO!

	Jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks
	back and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of
	their hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes
	into a million tiny pieces.

				DAVID
			(breathless)
		Oh my God ...
			(sinking to his knees/
			scooping up the remains)
		Oh my God ...

				JENNIFER
		David, stop stressing, you can like--
		turn it on normally ...

				DAVID
		No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It
		doesn't work without a remote.

	David cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the
	DOORBELL RINGS behind him.

				JENNIFER
		Oh my God! He's here!

	Jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa
	and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David
	just stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer
	reaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair
	quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. FRONT DOOR.

	Jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't
	Mark Davis on the other side. DICK VAN DYKE STANDS ACROSS THE
	THRESHOLD IN A TV REPAIRMAN'S OUTFIT. Jennifer looks at him
	puzzled. He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin,
	toolbox in hand.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		TV repair.

				JENNIFER
			(beat)
		TV repair?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Yeah. TV busted?

				JENNIFER
			(pause ...)
		Yeah ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(smiling wider)
		Well here I am.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID'S POV.

	He glances out the front door toward a weird VAN parked at
	the curb. It says TV REPAIR on the side but looks like
	something from a medicine show. The antenna on top resembles
	a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy
	family from the 1950s, gathered around their TV set. Everyone
	wears a smile, including the dog. The hand-painted motto
	reads "Rob's TV Repair--WE'LL FIX YOU FOR GOOD."

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then
	crosses to the living room STEPPING NIMBLY AROUND THE
	OTTOMAN. He heads toward the TV.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(seeing the smashed remote)
		Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little
		disaster didn't ya fella.

				DAVID
		Yeah ... Sort of ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(setting down the toolbox)
		We'll get you fixed up in no time.

	He pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just
	stare. It's a strange looking box with the same happy family
	painted on the side. Dick Van Dyke pulls out another remote.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		I know how I'd feel if mine went out.
		Almost like losing a friend.

				DAVID
			(tentatively)
		You know, we didn't call any TV repair.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Well that makes it a lucky day for both
		of us, hunh?

	Jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living
	room.

				JENNIFER
		You think you could do this like soon?
		It's almost six thirty.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What's the rush?

				DAVID
			(cutting her off)
		The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six
		thirty.

	At that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a
	booming CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of
	the house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Pleasantville?

	David recoils slightly. Dick Van Dyke flashes him a smile.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for
		years.

				JENNIFER
		That's not the reason. I've got a date
		at six thirty.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(ignoring her/
			leaning closer to David)
		Hey--who did Muff in take to the
		masquerade ball when her date came down
		with the measles?

				DAVID
			(stunned)
		... Her father.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Right. And how did she dress him?

				DAVID
			(still staring)
		... Like Prince Charming.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(studying David/
			nodding)
		Nice ... Nice ...

				JENNIFER
		Um--hello? I've got like a social
		emergency here.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(ignoring her)
		Remember the one where Bud lost his
		cousin when he was s'posed to be
		watching him?

				DAVID
		Yeah ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What department store did they go to?

				DAVID
		McIntire's.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		McGinty's.

				DAVID
		No. McIntire's. Remember:
			(sings)
		"For the very best in men's attire,
		Head right down to McIntire's."

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(stunned)
		That's right.

	He stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles
	fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Say--why don't you take this remote
		instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph"
		in it.

				DAVID
		Ooomph?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you
		want something that'll put you right in
		the show.

				JENNIFER
			(quickly)
		We'll take it.

	CLOSER.

	He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking
	contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a
	strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash
	Gordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while
	Jennifer and David stare at him warily ...

				DAVID
			(beat)
		How much does it cost?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh--couldn't charge you for something
		like that. It's free.

				JENNIFER
		Free?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the
		least I could do.

	There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first.
	The house rattles for a moment then is quiet.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Well, I better get going. Your show's
		almost on, and ...
			(smiling at Jennifer)
		It's almost time for your date.

	He places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and
	smiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he
	suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and
	tumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a
	perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing
	position. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he
	looks back at them and smiles.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
			(grinning)
		Take care now.

	There is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the
	doorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the
	front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two
	before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his
	head.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	David glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the
	coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he
	reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he
	picks it up.

	CLOSER.

	David points the remote toward the TV set with an
	apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then
	pushes one of the buttons.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	The TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an
	angry housewife screams at a transvestite!

				DAVID
		Hunh.

	It ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time
	the channel changes.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(relaxing)
		Great.

	He continues to press the button, flipping through the
	channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches
	for the remote.

				JENNIFER
		Lemme see that.

				DAVID
		No way.

	He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on
	the Pleasantville Marathon.

	BUD'S VOICE fills the room.

				BUD (OS)
			(on TV)
		Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow
		your transistor radio?

				MARY SUE (OS)
			(on TV)
		I promised Betty Jane she could use it
		over the weekend.

	FULL SHOT. TV SET. "PLEASANTVILLE" (BLACK AND WHITE)

	Bud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor
	radio. They seem to be in the EXACT SAME POSITION as David
	and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control.

	ANGLE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

	She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction.

				JENNIFER
		Do you mind. This is like the most
		important moment of my whole life.

				DAVID
		Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for
		this.

				BUD (OS)
			(on TV)
		"But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a
		transistor in to electric shop."

				MARY SUE (OS)
			(on TV)
		"And I told Betty Jean she could have it
		for the picnic with Roy."

				JENNIFER
			(yanking at it)
		God, David. Just give it to me!

				DAVID
			(yanking it back)
		Get lost!

				JENNIFER
		YOU get lost!

	WIDER. LIVING ROOM.

	She tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands.
	David pulls in the opposite direction as they POINT IT
	DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TV.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT.

	A huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their
	own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a
	BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets
	sucked into the TV.

	WIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM.

	It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of
	the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY.

	David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's
	living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They
	still clutch the remote control in the exact same position
	that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and
	Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around
	the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE...

				DAVID
			(a whisper)
		Oh my God.

				JENNIFER
		What happened?

				DAVID
		I'm not sure.

	WIDER

	George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the
	landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit
	with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.

				GEORGE
			(as if to his own children)
		Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a
		move on, you're gonna be late for school.

	He continues to cross through the living room whistling into
	the kitchen ...

				JENNIFER
			(desperately)
		What did you do?

				DAVID
		I don't know.

				JENNIFER
			(examining her black and white skin)
		Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!

	He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in
	his hand. David frantically presses the buttons but nothing
	happens. All at once, there is a voice behind them.

				VOICE (OS)
		Psst! Over here.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	They whirl around to see DICK VAN DYKE'S FACE smiling at them
	from the TV set in the comer. It's an old '50s set with a big
	round picture tube. They run over to him as he smiles. His
	face is the only color in the room.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(beaming)
		Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you
		thought I was just a fan or something.

				JENNIFER
		What happened?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		A miracle.

	They stare stunned at the TV set.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		... See, every time I thought I'd found
		someone they'd turn out to disappoint me.
		They'd know the early episodes, but they
		wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd
		know all about Muffin but they wouldn't
		know about Bud ...

				DAVID
			(to the TV set)
		What the hell's going on!

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're
		in ...
			(smiles)
		You know ...

	David glances around at his black and white surroundings. His
	"mother's" voice rings out from the kitchen.

				BETTY (OS)
		Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the
		table.

				DAVID
		We're in Pleasantville?

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(grinning)
		Dream come true, hunh?

				JENNIFER
			(panicking)
		This isn't funny! I happen to have a
		very important date in like five minutes!

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Well, you don't have to worry about that
		anymore.

	FULL SHOT. TELEVISION SET. (COLOR)

	All at once the scene on the TV changes and Dick Van Dyke's
	picture gives way to a WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the WAGNER HOUSE.
	Mark Davis is standing at the front door, BANGING on the
	brass knocker. He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a
	moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk
	never looking back.

				MARK DAVIS
			(under his breath)
		... Bitch.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (BLACK AND WHITE AGAIN)

	Jennifer flings herself at the screen, as Dick Van Dyke
	appears all over again.

				JENNIFER
		Noooooo!

				DAVID
		You--you gotta get us out of here.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(recoiling slightly)
		Why would I do that?

				DAVID
		Because we don't belong!

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's
		Department store" ... "Their father
		dressed as Prince Charming." That was
		gorgeous Bud.

				DAVID
		My name's David.

				JENNIFER
			(wailing on the floor)
		Oh GOD ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(a little snippy)
		You know--this is a pretty strange way
		of showing your appreciation.

				DAVID
		Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We
		just--we want to go home now.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(hurt)
		But you don't know how long I've been
		looking for someone like you.

	A long face slowly descends on him.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		I'm very disappointed ...
			(deep breath)
		In fact ... I'm starting to get a little
		upset.

	David moves toward the screen.

				DAVID
		Don't get upset.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(snapping back)
		Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone
		for years ... You pour your heart into
		it ... This is a privilege you know.
			(shakes his head)
		I don't think I better talk about this
		right now.

				DAVID
		Where are you going ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		I don't think we should discuss this
		until I'm a little bit more composed.

				DAVID
		WAIT A MINUTE!!

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(turning his back)
		Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so
		emotional ...

				DAVID
		COME BACK!!!

	Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as
	the screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as
	Jennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and
	starts rapidly pushing buttons.

	Nothing happens.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(dropping the gizmo)
		Oh God.

				JENNIFER
		What's going to happen?

				DAVID
		I don't know ... It's not possible ...
			(looking at her)
		Is it possible?

				BETTY (OS)
		Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is
		getting cold.

				DAVID
		It can't be possible.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	Betty (their "mother") sticks her head into the living room
	wearing her black and white apron. She has a great big
	Pepsodent smile.

				BETTY
		Well, come on kids. You're not going off
		to school without a hot breakfast inside
		you ...

	They just stare at her.

				BETTY (CONT)
		Forward march.

	They exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to
	their feet. Jennifer waits for David who forces a smile then
	starts toward the kitchen.

				BETTY (CONT)
		I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue.
		It's so flattering.

				JENNIFER
			(dazed)
		Thanks.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they
	suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them:

	THEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN.

	Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table.
	There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs.
	Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham.
	The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George
	Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.

				GEORGE
			(once again)
		Morning kids. Better get a move on or
		you're going to be late for school.

	They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright
	sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle
	symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare
	straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the
	heap.

				DAVID
			(under his breath)
		I don't believe this.

				JENNIFER
		Neither do I.

				GEORGE
		Well, c'mon. Dig in.

	David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two
	heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves.

				BETTY
			(to Jennifer)
		I put blueberries in them just the way
		you like.

				JENNIFER
		Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.

				BETTY
			(big smile)
		Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to
		start your day with a nice big breakfast.

	She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the
	chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(oppressively chipper)
		Here. Why don't you have some waffle
		cakes.
			(beat)
		And there's sausage and eggs and some
		good crisp bacon ...
			(beat)
		... And a ham steak.

	Betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge
	slab of butter.

				BETTY (CONT)
		... And of course, a nice big bowl of
		oatmeal.

	Jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who
	looks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks
	stunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a
	forkful of the oozing mess ...

								CUT TO:

	FULL SHOT. PAT BOONE.

	He stands facing the CAMERA in an actual Kinescope from 1958.
	The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the
	background singers are all white debutantes. He wears a
	letterman's sweater and button down shirt ...

				PAT BOONE
		"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity
		... Oh rooty."

	He CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's
	nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). It becomes a slow and
	lilting melody ...

				PAT BOONE (CONT)
		"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE.

	The MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image
	of this strange "Utopia." The effect is a weird, sanitizied
	version of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video.
	There are men tipping their hats and women walking their
	dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen.

				PAT BOONE (VO)
			(slowly ...)
		"... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom."

	Pruned hedges. Twin beds. BIG houses. The CAMERA CRANES DOWN
	in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David
	and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs.

				JENNIFER
		I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.

				DAVID
		Just take deep breaths.

				JENNIFER
		All that animal fat. I feel it in my
		pores or something.

	Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from
	side to side--totally absorbed.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		I still don't see why we're doing this.

				DAVID
		We're supposed to be in school.

				JENNIFER
		We're supposed to be at home David! We're
		supposed to be in color!
			(wailing)
		Oh God ...

	A man calls out from across the street.

				MR. SIMPSON
		Hello Bud.

				DAVID
		Hello Mr. Simpson.

				MR. SIMPSON
		Hear your Dad got a new car.

				DAVID
		Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

				JENNIFER
		You know him?

				DAVID
		Owns the hardware store.

				JENNIFER
		Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know
		what's going on but you'd better fix it!
		I had a date with Mark Davis and I even
		bought new UNDERWEAR!

				DAVID
		We just gotta play along for a little
		while ... till that guy shows up again.
		Then I'll talk to him and ...

				JENNIFER
		Play along?

				DAVID
		Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and
		you're ... um--Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
			(ripping the barette from her hair)
		No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't
		dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell
		not going to do it for you!

				DAVID
		We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck
		until he comes back.

				JENNIFER
		Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?

				DAVID
		To who?

	Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror
	starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming
	SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the
	block.

	WIDER.

	Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come
	flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN)

	They work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of
	the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing
	across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response"
	anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a
	tree.

				FIREMAN
		C'mere, kitty ...

	He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the
	tree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by
	them, petting it gently as he goes.

				JENNIFER
		Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like
		"Nerdville".
			(shakes her head)
		I always knew you'd pay a price for
		this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly
		geekridden for this long without
		suffering some like, really tragic
		consequences.
			(voice wavering)
		... But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm
		starting to get really--popular. Debbi
		Russell transferred to another school
		and my skin's been great since March and
		Mark Davis is starting to come around
		and ...

				BOY'S VOICE (OS)
		Hello Mary Sue.

	Jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old
	driving by in his convertible. He is extremely handsome with
	Jack Armstrong features and a Letterman's sweater. Despite
	her crisis, Jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl.
	Biff Martin flashes a huge Pepsodent smile. The guy is a
	"dreamboat".

				BIFF (CONT)
		What's all the commotion? Where's the
		cat?

				JENNIFER
		Um ... It's ...

	Biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the
	kitty in his arms.

				BIFF
		Ah, right ...
			(smiling at her again)
		Well--guess I'll see ya later Mary Sue.

	He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his
	really keen convertible. Jennifer gapes as he disappears
	around the corner.

				JENNIFER
		Who's that?

				DAVID
		Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball
		team.

				JENNIFER
			(still gaping)
		Does he--you know--like "me"?

				DAVID
		As a matter of fact he does.

				JENNIFER
			(flicking her hair)
		Hunh.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.

	Streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double
	doors. All cheery and very pleasant looking. It looks like a
	Leni Riefenstahl movie.

	ANGLE. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

	David stands beside Jennifer looking at the entrance to the
	school. Three girls huddle together by the front steps.

				JENNIFER
		Those are my friends.

				DAVID
		Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.

				JENNIFER
			(staring at them)
		Can we do any better?

				DAVID
		I don't think so.

				LISA ANNE
			(seeing her)
		Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for
		Geography.

				JENNIFER
		Okay ...

	She flicks her hair back--cops a first day of school
	attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the
	place.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER ...

	It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower
	Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve
	button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned
	to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the
	blackboard.

	ANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER.

	Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in
	her hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of
	the blackboard.

				MISS PETERS
		Last week Class, we discussed the
		geography of Main Street. This week,
		we're going to be talking about Elm
		Street. Can anyone tell me one of the
		differences between Elm Street and Main
		Street?
			(pointing)
		Tommy.

				TOMMY
		It's not as long?

	Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.

				MISS PETERS
		That's right, Tommy. It's not as long.
		Also, it only has houses. So the
		geography of Main Street is different
		than the geography of Elm Street.

	ANGLE. JENNIFER.

	She glances around at several students who seem to be nodding
	in agreement. All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air.

				MISS PETERS
		Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
		What's outside of Pleasantville?

	The teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her
	face. She looks vaguely troubled.

				MISS PETERS
		What?
			(beat)
		I don't understand ...

				JENNIFER
		Outside of Pleasantville ... What's at
		the end of Main Street?

	The class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say "Oh. We get
	it now. Boy what a stupid question." Miss Peters gives a kind
	but condescending look.

				MISS PETERS
		Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer
		to that. The end of Main Street is just
		the beginning again.

	Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and
	down. Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY.

	There are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym.
	Each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks
	with a "PLEASANTVILLE" jersey.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his
	hand. (Not exactly an athletic image.) David lets go of a
	jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. He looks
	a little surprised.

				DAVID
		Wow.

	He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David
	retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it
	up blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING
	NOTHING BUT NET.

	FULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM.

	Ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the
	hoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN
	NICKING THE RIM. The boys retrieve their shots as the coach
	claps his hands.

				COACH
		That's it men. Keep it up. Big game
		tomorrow.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely.
	David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces
	off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as
	smoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.

				BIFF (OS)
		Bud ...

	WIDER.

	Biff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the
	other side of the Gym. He is a classic All American Hero--
	somewhere between 4-H club member and a future astronaut.

				BIFF
			(a little nervous)
		Hi ya Bud.

				BUD
		Hi ya Biff.

	He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down.

				BIFF
		Can I ask you a question?

				BUD
		Sure.

				BIFF
		Well ... If I was to ask your sister ...
		What I mean is, if I was to go up to
		Mary Sue ...

				DAVID
		Oh God! Are we in that episode?

				BIFF
		What?

				DAVID
		I don't believe it.

				BIFF
		What's the matter?

				DAVID
		You want to ask her out tonight, right?
		And then you want to give her your
		school pin ...

				BIFF
		Yeah ... How'd you know?

				DAVID
			(shaking his head)
		Lucky guess.
			(beat)
		Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real
		good time for that right now ...

	Biff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David.

				DAVID (CONT)
		What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a
		little "different" lately ...

				BIFF
			(stunned)
		She won't go out with me?

				DAVID
		I didn't say that. It's just that right
		now ...

				BIFF
		I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't
		go out with me ...

	All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and
	hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of
	revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.

	WIDE ANGLE. GYM.

	Play comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE,
	DUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff.
	David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other
	side of the gym.

				DAVID
			(under his breath)
		Look, I'm sure we'll work something out.
		I'll talk to her or something.

	Biff looks at him, troubled.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Honest. It'll be fine.

	Biff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back.

								CUT TO:

	INT. CORRIDOR. LATER ...

	David stands off to the side with his sister, while class
	pours out around them.

				JENNIFER
		No way.

				DAVID
		One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If
		you don't go out with this guy we could
		throw their whole universe out of whack.

				JENNIFER
		It's too weird David. This place is
		giving me the creeps. Did you know all
		the books are blank?

				DAVID
		What?

				JENNIFER
		I looked in the library. They got covers
		with nothing inside them.

				DAVID
		What were you doing in a library?

				JENNIFER
		I got lost.
			(beat)
		Oh here ... look at this!

	She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches.
	Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire.

				DAVID
		JENNIFER!

				JENNIFER
		Just watch. You know why those guys just
		get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing
		burns around here, that's why! They
		don't need any firemen ...

	Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.

				DAVID
		Jen, listen ...

				JENNIFER
			(trembling)
		I like--really need a cigarette, too.

				DAVID
			(putting his arm around her)
		I'll get us out of here. I really will.
		But if we don't play along we could
		alter their whole existence. We may
		never get home.

	She looks over at him, slowly.

				JENNIFER
		You really think anybody's gonna, like,
		notice if I don't have a chocolate malt
		with this guy.

	At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering
	around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of
	wind-up toys.

				PEGGY JANE
			(high-pitched--rapid fire)
		You won't believe what we just heard.

				LISA ANNE
		Biff Martin's going to ask you out.

				BETTY JEAN
		And that's not all ...

				PEGGY JANE
		No, that's not all ...

				ALL THREE TOGETHER
		He's going to give you his pin!

	They explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer
	looks over at David.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. DUSK.

	A lone streetlamp glows in the foreground. Jennifer's voice
	plays OS.

				JENNIFER
		You sure I'm supposed to wear this?

	INT. MARY SUE'S ROOM.

	Jennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a
	poodle skirt. Under the sweater she wears a 1950's "bullet
	bra" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons.

				JENNIFER
			(looking in the mirror)
		I could like kill a guy with these
		things.

				DAVID
		It's in your closet.

				JENNIFER
			(examining her profile)
		I've worn some kinky stuff before ...

				DAVID
		He won't notice anyway.

				JENNIFER
		What do you mean?

				DAVID
		They don't notice that kind of thing.

				JENNIFER
		So what's the point?

				DAVID
		Jen please ...

				JENNIFER
		He-llo? I've got like three pounds of
		underwire here ...

				DAVID
		Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late
		for work.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. SODA SHOP. DUSK.

	The flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink.
	Underneath it, the swirling script spells "SODA SHOP". Johnny
	Mathis drifts out into the evening air ...

	CLOSER.

	David comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get
	his breath. He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges
	inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	Mr. Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the
	counter. He is a "pleasant" looking man, in his early forties
	wearing a white apron and black glasses. The strains of
	"MISTY" get louder as Bud lets the screen door slam behind
	him.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(looking up)
		Bud?

				DAVID
		Sorry ... I had to help my folks and
		then I couldn't find my hat ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh.

	He stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		I didn't know what to do.

	He stares at the rag a little troubled.

				DAVID
		What's wrong?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well--I always wipe down the counter and
		then you set out the napkins and glasses
		and then I make the french fries ...

				DAVID
			(confused)
		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.

	He looks down at the towel clearly disturbed. David pauses
	for a moment then starts toward him.

				DAVID
		I'm sorry.

	He crosses to Mr. Johnson who has polished one section of the
	counter right down to the wood. David takes the towel out of
	his hand and folds it neatly in front of him.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(gently)
		You know, if this ever happens again,
		you can make the fries even if I haven't
		put out the napkins yet.

				MR. JOHNSON
		I'm so glad you're here.

				DAVID
		I understand.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	Biff's convertible rolls up to the curb with Pat Boone
	playing on the radio. He runs a comb through his short blonde
	hair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and
	heading up the walk. Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment
	later, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway ...

				BIFF
		Oh. Mary Sue ...

	EXT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	The place is really hopping now. All the spots in the parking
	lot are filled with vintage "jalopies" and several patrons
	are streaming through the door. The SAME JOHNNY MATHIS SONG
	is still PLAYING on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda
	sign blinks against the sky.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	David is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to
	keep up with the load. Several clean cut teenagers pepper him
	with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. It's
	clear he isn't used to this.

				DAVID
			(frazzled)
		Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two
		orders of fries and a split?

				TEEN AGE GIRL
		Peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes,
		order of fries, and we'll split it.

	David nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow. He
	scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as Mr. Johnson
	comes up beside him.

				MR. JOHNSON
		There aren't any cheeseburgers.

				DAVID
			(turning)
		What?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well, usually I put out the burger and
		then you finish with the lettuce ...

				DAVID
		Listen to me!

	Mr. Johnson recoils slightly.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Do you have the lettuce?

				MR. JOHNSON
		... Yeah.

				DAVID
		Have you cooked the burgers?

				MR. JOHNSON
			(quieter)
		Yes.

				DAVID
		Well you can just put on the lettuce,
		finish the burger and pretend it was me
		doing it all along.

	Mr. Johnson stares at him.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Really. It's fine.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE.

	The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a
	Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays
	through, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her
	"girlfriends" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a
	table, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing
	against him as she goes.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and
	apprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda
	spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all
	over his chest.

	FULL SHOT. TABLE.

	Biff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome
	devotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross
	between Troy Donahue and a mannequin.

				BIFF
			(haltingly)
		I sure am glad you said you'd come out
		with me tonight Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
			(full blown "Mary Sue")
		Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad
		you asked me.

	He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.

				BIFF
		I don't know if I ever said this to you
		before, but, well ... I think you're
		just about the keenest girl in the whole
		school ...

				JENNIFER
		Really Biff? The keenest?

				BIFF
		Oh yeah.

				JENNIFER
			(all sarcasm)
		Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

				DAVID (OS)
		What can I get you two?

	WIDER.

	He stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper
	and a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost
	bursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty
	angle with large white apron tied around his neck.

				BIFF
		Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my
		usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

	More goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the
	same dopey countenance.

				JENNIFER
		Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a
		salad and an Evian Water.

	He shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		Cheeseburger it is.

	ANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David
	posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an
	eye on the table the entire time ...

	RESUME. TABLE.

	Biff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look
	on his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him.
	She's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue."

				BIFF
		See the whole time we were in civics
		together, I really wanted to sit next to
		you--but you were always sitting between
		Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne.

	There is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond.

				BIFF (CONT)
		... And you always seemed so smart and
		everything. Like that report you did on
		"Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know
		what I'd talk to you about.

				JENNIFER
		Well, sometimes talking's over-rated.
		Don't you think?

				BIFF
		Hunh?
			(goony laugh)
		Oh, right ...

	He still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two
	then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary
	break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all
	over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.

				BIFF (CONT)
		So I know I haven't been steady with
		anybody, but I just don't want to rush
		it. You don't want to make a mistake
		with something that important.

				JENNIFER
		Oh, gosh no.

				BIFF
		I mean, there's kids that are even
		holding hands already but I figure
		there's plenty of time for that kind of
		thing later on. Don't you?

				JENNIFER
		Oh you bet.
			(beat)
		Will you excuse me for a sec?

	Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister
	practically stumbles through the bathroom door.

	INT. BATHROOM.

	Of course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way
	to the sink and leans against the counter.

				JENNIFER
		Jesus Chirist ...

	She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a
	dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a
	moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.

				GIRL'S VOICES
			(overlapping)
		"Did he give it to you ... Did he give
		it to you ... I bet he gave it to her
		... Did he give it to you?"

				JENNIFER
			(straight ahead)
		I don't think he knows how.

	They TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It
	sounds like an aviary.

				LISA ANNE
		I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's
		Lane.

				PEGGY JANE
		I bet he is. I bet he is.

				BETTY JEAN
		I bet he's even gonna hold her hand!

	They TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	David is standing beside their table as she retums from the
	bathroom.

				DAVID
			(chipper)
		Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry
		cokes.
			(pointedly)
		If you need anything, I'll be right over
		there.

				JENNIFER
			(Mary Sue)
		Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly
		need when we have each other?

	She flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and TOUCHES
	BIFF'S HAND. Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her
	brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye." David
	just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the
	Soda fountain.

				BIFF
			(befuddled)
		Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over
		and sit next to you in civics but ...

				JENNIFER
		You want to get out of here?

				BIFF
		What?

				JENNIFER
		You wanna get out of here? You wanna
		leave?

				BIFF
			(confused)
		But where would we go?

				JENNIFER
			(shrugging)
		... Lover's Lane.

				BIFF
			(swallow)
		Lover's Lane!

	There is an audible GASP from the booth behind them. Jennifer
	ignores it.

				JENNIFER
		Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	He just stares at her with his mouth open ...

	WIDER.

	Jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand.

				JENNIFER
		C'mon. Let's go.

	FULL SHOT. SODA FOUNTAIN.

	David is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he
	sees Jennifer leading Biff by the hand into the parking lot.
	Everyone at the counter is enjoying their dessert, when David
	lets out a blood curdling scream.

				DAVID
		NOOOOOO!

	He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door.
	Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance ...

	EXT. SODA SHOP.

	Biff's car is just pulling onto the street when David sprints
	into the parking lot. He takes off after the car, sprinting
	down the street.

				DAVID
		YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T
		EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO
		DOESN'T EXIST!

	The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a
	jog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the
	street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on
	his face.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(to God)
		Thanks a lot.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is a beautiful tree-lined pond with a lush willow tree in
	the foreground. The moonlight glistens silver across the
	water. Several cars are parked in a row with their occupants
	HOLDING HANDS. Biff's convertible is parked at the end.

	SHOT. BIFF'S CAR.

	He sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead. Jennifer
	is draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the
	most of her mohair sweater. She stares at Biff in a not-so-
	Pleasantville-kind-of-way. He glances over at her and
	swallows.

				BIFF
		Sure is pretty.

				JENNIFER
			(staring at him)
		Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.

				BIFF
		To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think
		you'd want to come here until we'd been
		pinned for a little while.

				JENNIFER
		Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you
		want to.

	She leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top
	of the seat. Her tits point toward the sky.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
			(breathy)
		Or maybe I should just "pin" you.

	He looks over at her a little confused, then breaks into his
	goony laugh.

				BIFF
		Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you
		possibly pin me?

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	He is still guffawing when he looks over at Jennifer and
	suddenly freezes. Biff's eyes widen ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	David comes sprinting up to the porch, then doubles over
	catching his breath. He clings onto the porch swing when the
	door opens behind him.

				BETTY
		Bud?

	WIDER.

	His "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch. David
	catches his breath then forces a smile.

				GEORGE
		Son, what's wrong?

				DAVID
		Have you seen Mary Sue?

				BETTY
		Why no. She's still on her date with
		Biff ... is something the matter?

				DAVID
			(still panting a little)
		No, I ... I was just ... worried about
		her.

	His mother and father exchange a "knowing" look. George rests
	a hand on his shoulder.

				GEORGE
			(oppressively paternal)
		Bud, your sister's a little older now
		and she's naturally going to start going
		out with boys.
			(beat)
		... In fact pretty soon--she's even
		going to get married and make someone a
		good little home-maker like your mother
		here.
			(smiles at Betty/
			inside joke)
		That's IF she can learn to bake.

				BETTY
		Oh, George ...

				GEORGE
		But your sister is a fine young woman
		and she would never do anything for us
		to be concerned about.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	The low gutteral MOANS of two coupling animals drifts out
	over the evening air. It is raw and primitive and desperate.
	The CAMERA begins to TRACK behind all the other cars--their
	occupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette. It
	finally COMES TO REST on a convertible at the end, with a
	girl's leg sticking out the window.

	CLOSER.

	A Letterman's sweater hangs over the door. The windshield is
	completely fogged. Jennifer's sweater is draped over the
	backseat. The car is rocking.

	INT. CAR.

	They are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff
	pulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered
	with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's
	stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings
	desperately to the steering wheel.

				BIFF
			(some terror)
		I think I better go home now Mary Sue ...

	She holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard.

				JENNIFER
			(breathless)
		... Why?

				BIFF
			(more terror)
		I think ... I might be ill ...

	He glances down at his lap a little confused.

				BIFF (CONT)
			(a whisper)
		I think something's happening to me.

	He looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up
	and grabs a handful of his hair.

				JENNIFER
		It's s'posed to happen, Biff.

				BIFF
		It is?

				JENNIFER
		Trust me ...

	He looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down,
	and OUT OF FRAME ...

								CUT TO:
	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	A single light is burning in the kitchen window.

				BETTY (OS)
		Do you want some more cookies?

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his
	face. There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs
	all over the table.

				DAVID
			(sick)
		Oh no ... I'm fine.

				BETTY
		How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?

				DAVID
		I'm fine.

	There is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up.

				BETTY
		Now who could that be.

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents." David
	swings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the
	porch.

				DAVID
		Oh hi!

				MR. JOHNSON
		Hi there. You took off so quick. I
		wasn't sure if you were okay.

				DAVID
		Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ...
		Had to get home early.

	Mr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone
	of voice.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Bud ...

				DAVID
		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(sotto)
		You know how when we close up, I close
		the register, then you lower the shades,
		then I turn out the lights, then we both
		lock the doors.

				DAVID
		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(proud)
		Well you weren't around this time so I
		did the whole thing myself.

	CLOSER.

	Mr. Johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face.
	His shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little.
	There is a sudden sparkle in his eye.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(more confidential)
		Not only that, I didn't even do it in
		the same order. First I lowered the
		shades, then I closed the register.

	He looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance
	behind him.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Oh, hello Betty.

				BETTY
		Hello Bill.

	Neither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks
	on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and
	his new found virility.

				DAVID
			(quickly)
		Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ...
		really appreciate it.

	He turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's
	convertible pulls up at the curb.

	INT. CAR. CLOSE UP. JENNIFER.

	She looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car (OUT
	OF FRAME).

				JENNIFER
		Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really
		wonderful time.

	ANGLE. BIFF. OTHER SIDE OF CAR.

	He sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his
	face. Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit
	with a couple of thousand volts.

				BIFF
		... Me too.

	She leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites
	his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff
	smiles back.

	EXT. CAR.

	She climbs out and shuts the door. Jennifer nods to Mr.
	Johnson as she heads up the walk.

				JENNIFER
			(sweetly)
		Hello Mr. Johnson.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh, hello Mary Sue.

	She is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch.
	David grabs her arm.

				DAVID
			(urgent whisper)
		What did you do to him?

				JENNIFER
			(innocently)
		Nothing.

	She starts up the staircase. David follows her and the CAMERA
	follows them both.

				DAVID
		What do you mean "nothing?" That's not
		nothing. That's ...

	She reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him.

				JENNIFER
		Relax "Bud." We had a really nice time.
			(mock YAWN)
		... Now I'm really tired and we gotta
		get up early for school in the morning
		so ...

	She flashes her brother an evil grin.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		'Night.

	She shuts the door softly in his face. David stairs at the
	gray wood in front of him.

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	Biff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in
	his eye. The car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or
	two, before he glances over to his right.

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	The stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement:

	BIFF'S POV. ROSE.

	There, against a gray picket fence, on a black and white
	street in a black and white neighborhood, A SINGLE RED ROSE
	IS BLOOMING.

								CUT TO:

	AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. MORNING

	It would be a stunning vista if it wasn't in black and white.
	The church steeple gleams in the sunlight. The perfect little
	houses look like a row of pretty toys ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. DAY.

	David sits parked in front of the TV furtively turning
	through the channels. He flips the dial frantically. No sign
	of Dick Van Dyke.

				BETTY (OS)
		Bud. It's 7:30 in the morning. Are you
		watching television?

	He gives her a sheepish grin and sighs ...

								CUT TO:
	INT. SCHOOL GYM. DAY.

	It is the same configuration as earlier. Everyone wears their
	Pleasantville "Lions" jerseys, white sneakers and black
	socks. David enters the Gym a little groggy. He hasn't had
	much sleep.

	CLOSER.

	He looks up and stops. David cocks his head to the side,
	staring across the gym.

	HIS POV. BIFF AND OTHER BOYS.

	They are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball
	under his arm. Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly
	describing something that is holding their RAPT ATTENTION.

	WIDER ANGLE. INCLUDING DAVID.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		Oh no ...

	Biff continues his story while they stare at him with their
	mouths open. The Coach blows his whistle.

				COACH
		Come on men. Let's go. Big game next
		week.

	The huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander
	toward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES
	EVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge
	of the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym.
	Everyone stares in disbelief.

				DAVID
		Oh my God ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. DAY.

	David stands face to face with his sister in mid
	conversation.

				DAVID
		You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED
		you.

				JENNIFER
		So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay.
		They're like not good at basketball
		anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.

				DAVID
		You don't understand. You're messing
		with their UNIVERSE.

				JENNIFER
		Well maybe it needs to be messed with.
		Did that ever like--occur to you?
			(beat)
		You know, they don't want to be like
		this, it's just that nobody ever helped
		them before.

				PEGGY JANE
			(walking past)
		"MS". How you doin'?

				JENNIFER
		Kewl "PJ". How you doin'?

				PEGGY JANE
			(relishing her new word)
		"Kewl."

	Jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by.

				DAVID
		You have no right to do this.

				JENNIFER
		Well if I don't who will?

				DAVID
		They're happy like this.

				JENNIFER
		David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt
		and a sweater set.
			(pause ...)
		You like all this don't you?

	David recoils slightly.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		I mean, you don't think it's just like
		dorky or funny or something ... you
		really like it.
			(shudders)
		Oh God! I am just so personally
		horrified right now ...

				DAVID
		I just don't think we have the right
		to ...

				JENNIFER
		David, let me tell you something. These
		people don't want to be geeks. They want
		to be "attractive." They've got a lot of
		potential, they just don't know any
		better.

				DAVID
		They don't have that kind of potential.

				JENNIFER
		Um--hello? You want to like take a look?

	Jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked
	in an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and
	the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is
	sexually charged. They speak to one another in a close
	whisper--their faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets
	shy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum,
	but the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME.

				BOY
		Wow. What kind of gum is that?

	CLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

	He looks over in shock as she sucks the BRIGHTLY COLORED
	BUBBLE GUM back into her mouth. Jennifer flicks her hair.

				JENNIFER
		I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the
		flagpole.

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS
	LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF
	THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang
	out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's
	Lane as the pond glistens in the distance ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.

	It is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman
	Rockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter
	and a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's
	best friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother
	sits at her side.

				DR. HENDERSON
		Let me see it again.

	Lisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE.
	Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her
	tongue literally gleams with color.

				DR. HENDERSON (CONT)
			(examining it)
		Well ... I don't think it's anything to
		worry about ... It'll probably just
		clear up by itself.
			(to Lisa Anne)
		Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate.
		No french fries, that kind of thing.
			(aside/
			to the Mother)
		It's just a "teenage" thing.


	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is really rocking now. More cars are lined up along the
	edge of the lake as the REAL (AND NASTY) VERSION OF TOOTY
	FRUITY (BY LITTLE RICHARD) PLAYS OS:

				LIL RICHARD (VO)
		"... Got a gal--her name is Sue. She
		knows just what to do ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. (MONTAGE)

	PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	TOOTY FRUITY CONTINUES AS DAVID FLIPS FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE
	CHANNELS LOOKING FOR DICK VAN DYKE. THERE IS ONLY A PEPSODENT
	COMMERCIAL. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM (MUSIC CONT ...)

	The Pleasantville Lions lose a game late in the second half.
	The scoreboard reads 84 to 16 ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

	David examines the back of the TV set ...

	INT. FURNITURE STORE. (MUSIC CONT...)

	A large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at
	an item on the display floor, like it is the monolith in
	"2001". They seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as
	the CAMERA PUSHES IN TO REVEAL: a double bed ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

	David sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a
	Brillcream commercial plays in front of him ...

				LIL RICHARD (OS)
		"... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam
		boom!"

	SODA SHOP. NIGHT. ON DAVID.

	He heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but
	he's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT
	RED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He
	shakes his head.

	SODA SHOP.

	The place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a
	couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The
	letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The
	Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and
	Roll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air.
	Somebody has played the flip side.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young
	couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and
	hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are
	FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return
	to normal. David shakes his head.

	FOLLOWING HIM.

	He crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad
	of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND
	THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE
	STOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his
	sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder.

				DAVID
		What'll it be?

				BIFF
			(still chipper as ever)
		Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the
		usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

	Bud has already written it down. He glances over at his
	sister.

				JENNIFER
		Me too. Sounds swell.

				DAVID
			(pointed)
		Really? It seems so fattening.

	Before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind
	the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(staring straight ahead)
		There aren't any cheeseburgers.

				DAVID
			(exasperated)
		Look. I thought we talked about this, I
		thought we said ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh--what's the point, Bud?

	CLOSER.

	Mr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness
	in his eyes. David grabs his arm.

				DAVID
		C'mere.

	He pulls him along the counter toward a little office
	storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the
	door.

	INT. STOREROOM.

	It is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a
	small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a
	happy family motoring in their Rambler.

				DAVID
		What did you say?

	Mr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well ... I'm not sure I see the point
		anymore.

				DAVID
		What are you talking about! You make
		hamburgers! That is the point!

				MR. JOHNSON
		No I know ... I know I do ...
			(he pauses, then looks up)
		But it's always the same, you know?
		Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the
		cheese ... It never changes. It never
		gets any better or worse ...

				DAVID
		Just listen to me ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(not hearing him)
		... Like the other night, when I closed
		up by myself. That was different ...

				DAVID
		Forget about that!

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh ... Okay.
			(beat/
			lower)
		... But I really liked it.

	Bud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries
	to speak softly.

				DAVID
		Look, you can't always like what you do.
		Sometimes you just do it because it's
		your job. And even if you don't like it,
		you just gotta do it anyway.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Why?

				DAVID
			(exasperated)
		So they can have their hamburgers!

	This sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(like a secret)
		You know what I really like?

				DAVID
			(warily)
		... What's that?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Christmastime.

	David rolls his eyes. Mr. Johnson leans closer, speaking
	furtively.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint
		the Christmas decorations in the window.
		And every year, I get to paint a
		different thing ...
			(beat)
		One year it's the North Pole. The next
		I do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show
		you.

	He pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens
	it for David.

				DAVID
			(impressed)
		Wow ... That's pretty good ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		Thanks.
			(continuing)
		But this morning I was thinking about
		it and I realized that I looked forward
		to it all year. And then I thought "Gee.
		That seems awfully silly. That seems
		like an awfully long time to be waiting
		for just one moment, don't you think?"

	David looks at him speechless.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Well don't you?

				DAVID
		I think you should try not to think
		about this anymore.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Really?

				DAVID
		Yeah.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.

								CUT TO:

	INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

	The Barber Pole spins in three shades of gray. Several men
	are gathered around the two chairs in the front of Gus' shop.
	Besides being the barbershop, it is the bastion of all male
	life in Pleasantville. Bud and Mary Sue's "father" (George)
	sits in one of the chairs. "Big Bob" McGee, owner of the
	drugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the
	other. He has a crew cut that's getting shorter.

				GUS
		Have they ever lost before?

				GEORGE
		Basketball? No they sure haven't.

				BOB
		Just feels "wrong", that's all.

	There are several murmurs.

				THIRD PATRON
		Maybe that's where they get that saying,
		"can't win 'em all."

				GUS
		Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They
		do have that saying.

				BOB
		But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've
		always won 'em all.

				GUS
		Well, yeah. That's true too.

	More murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure.

								CUT TO:

	INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DAY.

	The women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen
	like it does every Wednesday afternoon. Four women are seated
	around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix
	between them. Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the
	woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office.

				MARGE
			(dealing the cards)
		... He said it would clear up on its
		own if she just stayed away from fried
		foods and sweets ...

				BETTY
		Well that makes sense.

				MARGE
		Except it's spread to her lips now too.
		Oh, I don't know.

				MARY
			(a THIRD WOMAN)
		And you say it's just "red?"

				MARGE
		Well--like red, only ... "redder."

				MARY
		Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like
		the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was
		going by it the other day and it looked
		green only "greener."

	SHOT. BETTY.

	She looks up quickly--then grabs some bridge mix.

				MARGE
			(lowering her voice)
		Have you seen him lately? The man
		doesn't look like himself. I was
		getting my sewing machine fixed across
		the street and he was sitting in the
		window of his shop just staring.
		Wasn't looking at anything in
		particular--just staring off into space.

				MARY
		That is strange.

	Betty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in
	front of her, when her eyes go wide.

	HER POV. BRIDGE HAND.

	They are ALL HEARTS and all BRIGHT RED. It looks like a
	fistfful of valentines.

	CLOSE UP. BETTY.

	She puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath.
	Betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before
	lifting them up and taking another look.

				MARGE
		Betty, it's your bid.

	She swallows trying to keep her composure.

				BETTY
		Uh ... Seven hearts.

	They murmur at the strength of the hand.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	The SOUND of the television plays OS while a warm light burns
	in the window.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	Jennifer and Betty stand at the sink finishing the dishes.
	Betty washes while Jennifer dries and it's clear who's more
	used to this. Jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places
	a dish in the drying rack.

				BETTY
		Mary Sue?

				JENNIFER
		Yeah?

	Betty hesitates. Rinses out a pot.

				BETTY
		Can I ask you a question?

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

	She pauses for a long moment.

				BETTY
		What goes on up at Lover's Lane?

				JENNIFER
			(turning toward her)
		What do you mean?

				BETTY
		Well, you hear all these things lately.
		You know--kids spending so much time up
		there ...
			(she looks over)
		Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?

				JENNIFER
		Yeah ...
			(beat)
		That--and ...

	She stops herself.

				BETTY
		What?

				JENNIFER
		It doesn't matter.

				BETTY
		No. I want to know.

				JENNIFER
			(glances toward the living room/
			lowers her voice)
		... Sex.

				BETTY
		Ah.

	Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A
	beat goes by ...

				BETTY (CONT)
		What's sex?

	Jennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at
	her with a blank, curious expression. Jennifer hesitates.

				JENNIFER
		You sure you want to know this?

				BETTY
		Yes.

				JENNIFER
		Okay.

	She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of
	the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to
	the kitchen counter and turns to her.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		You see Mom ...
			(softer and with understanding)
		When two people like each other very
		much ...

	Betty looks at her and nods ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	The TV keeps flickering in the window.

	INT. KITCHEN. LATER ...

	The CAMERA PANS across the kitchen table where there is a
	full quart of milk and some uneaten co6kies. It finally comes
	to rest on Jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table
	with a concerned look on her face.

				JENNIFER
		You okay?

	REVERSE ANGLE. BETTY.

	She nods--shaken but "fine." Betty stares long and hard at
	the plate of chocolate chip cookies. She's far away.

				BETTY
		Yes ...
			(softly)
		It's just that ...

				JENNIFER
			(gently)
		What?

				BETTY
		Well ...
			(looking up)
		... Your father would never do anything
		like that.

	SHOT. JENNIFER.

	She bites her lip weighing her next sentence ...

				JENNIFER
			(leaning forward)
		Oh. Hmm ...
			(whisper/
			woman to woman)
		Well, Mom ... there's ways to "enjoy"
		yourself without Dad.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She looks across the table, perplexed.

								CUT TO:

	INT. PARKER BEDROOM. NIGHT.

	George crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the
	middle of the room. He wears long sleeve pajamas that are
	buttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk
	on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is
	barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering.

				GEORGE
		Sweetie? You coming to bed?

	There is no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Betty?

	INT. BATHROOM.

	She stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub. Her
	dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well.

				BETTY
			(calling out)
		Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath
		first.

	CLOSER. BETTY.

	She swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches
	for the spigot and turns on the water. Betty's heart beats a
	little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN.

	CLOSER STILL ...

	Betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top
	of her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor,
	standing naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances
	toward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a
	deep breath and steps into the tub.

	EVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ...

	Betty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the
	steam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like
	that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in
	the tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There
	is the slight trace of a smile.

	EXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE.

	Her eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently. The
	water continues to THUNDER DOWN as she arches her back.
	Betty's breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all
	over again:

	HER POV. BATHROOM ...

	ALL AT ONCE, EVERYTHING AROUND STARTS TO TURN FROM BLACK AND
	WHITE TO COLOR. A BIRD OUT THE WINDOW BECOMES A RED BREASTED
	ROBIN. THE TILE ON THE TUB TURNS OUT TO BE PURPLE. GREEN
	TOWEL ... PINK ROBE ... BRIGHT YELLOW DAISIES ON THE PLASTIC
	SHOWER CURTAIN.

	CLOSE UP. BETTY'S FACE.

	She stares in amazment. Beads of sweat form on Betty's
	forehead as the world goes to TECHNICOLOR. The THUNDERING
	WATER POUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND, but beneath can be heard the
	beginnings of a faint, low, MOAN. Her eyes dart around the
	room. Her breathing quickens: Faster ... Harder ... More
	intense ... THEN SUDDENLY ...

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	The HUGE ELM TREE across the street suddenly BURSTS INTO
	FLAMES. Fire shoots straight up into the sky as billowing
	clouds of black smoke fill the air. BRIGHT ORANGE FLAMES
	LIGHT UP THE NIGHT.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	David is staring at the television set when he notices a
	weird orange glow. He glances behind him, out the living room
	window ...

				DAVID
		Oh my God!

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	David comes racing out of the front door and down the walk. A
	small CROWD has gathered in front of the fire. (They don't
	seem frightened--just sort of amazed.) The street is still
	BLACK AND WHITE but it is now bathed in a weird ORANGE LIGHT.
	The flames leap higher and higher ...

				DAVID
		Jesus Christ ...

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He takes off down the block, as fast as he can run. The crowd
	continues to stare as David turns the corner at Main
	Street ...

	EXT. FIRE STATION.

	He races in the front of the building SCREAMING at the top of
	his lungs.

				DAVID
		FIRE! FIRE!

	INT. FIRE STATION.

	There is no sign of life on the ground floor. David races up
	the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story.

	INT. BUNKROOM.

	All the firemen are sitting around playing Gin Rummy when
	David rushes in the front door. They can hear his voice from
	down the hall.

				DAVID
			(entering)
		FIRE ... FIRE ...

	They still don't move. All the firemen just look at him from
	their bunks with a perplexed expression.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(beat)
		CAT!!!

	All at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets
	and their yellow slickers. They race to the landing just
	outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	The FIRE HAS SPREAD TO AN ADJOINING TREE as the FIRE ENGINE
	comes SCREAMING toward the house from the top of the block.
	David sits in the front of the truck next to the Fire Chief
	who drives the vehicle at break neck speed.

				DAVID
		Right here!

	The Fire ENGINE screeches to a halt. The Fire Chief looks
	around ...

				FIRE CHIEF
		Where is it?

	David shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He
	shakes his head and leaps from the truck.

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He races around to the back where the other firemen are
	standing just as confused. David grabs one of the hoses and
	begins to pull it from the truck.

				DAVID
		Here! Grab this nozzle.

				FIREMAN
		But where's the ...

				DAVID
		Just grab it!

	He strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the
	fireman and pulls him toward the curb. David parts the crowd
	and positions the man right in front of the flames.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(shouting)
		Okay! Now point this right at the
		flames--like this.

	The Fireman nods and does as he is told. David opens the
	valve sending out a huge FLUME OF WATER.

				FIREMAN
		Whoa!
			(beat)
		So that's what these do.

	A huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man
	who has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear
	to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another
	hose ...

				BOB (VO)
			(fading in)
		... In honor and in recognition of
		your heroism ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY

	David stands at a podium receiving a commendation from "Big"
	Bob McGee (the man from the barbershop). He holds a large
	plaque up for public display, while "David's" whole family
	beams in the background.

				BOB
		... And with great appreciation from
		the citizens of Pleasantville ...

	WIDER.

	A huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps. There are
	lots of balloons and bunting.

				BOB
		I am pleased to present You with this
		special commendation, from the
		Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce!

	He hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into
	APPLAUSE.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ...

	David walks away from the center of town looking down at his
	plaque. He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge
	when a young woman comes up beside him.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Hi Bud ...

	WIDER.

	She is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school,
	and one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka
	dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure.
	Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence.

				MARGARET
		That was sure swell ...

				DAVID
		Oh. Thanks, Margaret.

				MARGARET
			(smiling)
		I baked you my oatmeal cookies.

				DAVID
			(vaguely remembering an episode)
		Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.

				MARGARET
		No. I baked them for you.

				DAVID
		No. You baked them for Whitey.

				MARGARET
			(low and gutteral)
		No. I baked them for you.

	All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up
	against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her
	mouth is inches away from his.

				DAVID
		Um ... thanks.

	David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and
	freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment,
	unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville
	smile.

				MARGARET
		See ya.

	She turns and heads around the comer, while David just
	watches her dumbstruck.

								CUT TO:

	SODA SHOP. DUSK.

	David heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat.
	The BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to "hip" '50s JAZZ. DAVE
	BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a
	moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.

	SODA SHOP.

	The place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage
	hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house
	now. Brubeck's "TAKE FIVE" plays in the background while
	several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.

	DOORWAY.

	David walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of
	the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz
	on a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table.
	Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him.

				JENNIFER
			(in a whisper)
		I had nothing to do with that fire.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		It's okay.

				JENNIFER
		Not directly anyhow ...

				DAVID
		It's fine.

	David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the
	bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at
	him, with a weird expression of awe.

				JENNIFER
			(still under her breath)
		Um ... They like wanna ask you a
		question ... I didn't know how to
		handle it. So ...

				DAVID
		Sure.

	He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at
	him. It's like Elvis has entered the building.

				DAVID (CONT)
		How you doin?

				VARIOUS KIDS
		Swell ...

	They keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and
	forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ...

				BOY
		How'd you know about the fire?

				DAVID
		What?

				BOY
		How'd you know how to put it out and
		all?

	David hesitates, weighing his words.

				DAVID
		Well--where I used to live ...
		That's just what firemen did.

	This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.

				BOY
		And where's that?

				DAVID
			(carefully)
		Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

	This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids.
	It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A
	hush descends.

				BOY
		What's outside of Pleasantville?

				DAVID
		Look it doesn't matter. It's not
		important.

				BOY
		What is it?

	David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on
	every word.

				DAVID
		It's really not important.

				GIRL'S VOICE (OS)
		What's outside of Pleasantville?

	REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY.

	Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the
	doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the
	same excitement as the others, it just means so much more.

				MARGARET (CONT)
			(hungry for knowledge)
		C'mon. Tell us ...

	She stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might
	as well be touching him.

				DAVID
			(slowly)
		Well ... There are some places where
		the road doesn't go in a circle.
		There are some places where it keeps
		on going.

	There's an excited giggle. They lean forward.

				MARGARET
			(an exotic concept)
		Keeps going ...

				DAVID
		Well--it all just keeps going.
		Roads ... rivers ...

				2ND BOY
			(from the back)
		Like the "Mighty Mississippi".

				DAVID
		... What?

	He moves forward extending a book. The cover reads: "THE
	ADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY FINN." David opens the first page.
	There is printing inside.

				BOY
			(quoting)
		"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin'
		an' goin' as far you could see."

				DAVID
			(turning to Jennifer)
		I thought the books were blank?

				JENNIFER
		They were.

	He looks over at her.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
			(quickly)
		Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault.
		They asked me what it was about and I
		like didn't remember 'cause we had it
		back in tenth grade, But I told them
		what I DID remember, and the next
		thing I knew the pages had filled in.

				DAVID
		The pages filled in?

				JENNIFER
		But like only up to the part about
		the raft, because I didn't read any
		farther.

	CLOSER.

	David flips through the book and sure enough only the first
	chapter has print. The pages are blank after that.

				2ND BOY 
		Do you know how it ends?

				DAVID
			(hesitating)
		Well, yeah ... I do.

				MARGARET
			(breathless)
		So how does it end?

	She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of
	feet away. It's silent in the soda shop.

				DAVID
		Well--see ... they're both running
		away--Huck and the slave ... And ...
		They go up the river ... But--in
		trying to get free they sort of see
		that they're free already.

	David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book
	that aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE
	materialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the
	book, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(quietly)
		Oh my God.

				2ND BOY
		Wow!

				3RD BOY
		Do you know this one?

	He shoves another book in front of David.

				DAVID
		Hunh?
			(looks down at the book)
		Oh yeah ... Well this is great.
			(beat)
		See--Holden Caulfield is like this
		really lonely kid...

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY. DAY.

	The CAMERA PANS down from the "PUBLIC LIBRARY' sign to find
	the front door. A long line of kids waiting to check out
	their books stretches onto the sidewalk ...

	EXTREME WIDE SHOT. LIBRARY. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

	Several men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to
	the spinning barber pole. They watch the spectacle for a
	moment or two, as teenager after teenager exits with an
	armful of books.

				GUS
		I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.

				PHIL
		I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.

	Big Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut.

				PHIL (CONT)
		I mean goin' up to that lake all the
		time is one thing, but now they're
		going to a library! I mean what's next?

				BURT
		Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda.
		That's where they oughtta be.

	WIDER STILL.

	From the shadows of the Town Hall, up the block, David
	watches the stream of kids emerge with their books. They
	cradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound
	treasure ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	George sits on the edge of his Barka Lounger, across the
	coffee table from "Big" Bob McGee. Even sitting down the man
	is a looming presence. Besides owning the market, auto
	dealership, hardware store, and gas station, he also owns the
	insurance agency where George works. George sweats into his
	collar.

				GEORGE
		Want some bridge mix?

				BOB
		Oh, no thanks ...

				GEORGE
		Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...

				BOB
		I'm fine--but thank you.

	George nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans
	forward.

				BOB (CONT)
		George, you're probably wondering why
		I asked if I could come over today ...

	George shrugs--then nods--then shrugs ...

				BOB (CONT)
		I'm sure you've noticed the same
		things we all have--certain "changes"
		going on in the town.
			(beat)
		You know what I mean by "changes"?

				GEORGE
		"Changes."

				BOB
			(nodding)
		"Changes."
			(takes a belt of martini)
		And it's not just the fire or big
		stuff like that. It's little things.
			(beat)
		Did you hear about Bill Miller?

				GEORGE
			(concerned)
		No. What?

				BOB
		Wife wants him to get one of those
		new beds.

				GEORGE
		One of those ... big beds?

	Bob nods.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?

				BOB
		I really don't know.
			(beat)
		Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a
		boxboy at the market.

				GEORGE
		... How?

				BIG BOB
		Said he didn't want to do it anymore.
		Just took off his apron in the middle
		of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her
		groceries spread all over the counter
		... Took 'em four hours to sort the
		whole thing out.

				GEORGE
		Holy cow.

	Bob takes a belt of his drink ...

				BIG BOB
		George, everyone likes you.

				GEORGE
		Oh well ...

				BOB
		No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause
		you're a great bowler ... They respect
		you ...

				GEORGE
			(heartfelt)
		Thank you very much.

				BOB
		And it's important for them to see
		someone they respect, stand up for
		what's right. If you love a place,
		you can't sit around and watch this
		kind of thing happen to it.

				GEORGE
		No. Of course not.

				BOB
			(big patriarchal smile)
		And that's why I want you to be on
		the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.

				GEORGE
			(stunned/
			moved)
		Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

				BOB
			(smiling)
		Why don't you start by saying "yes,"
		and then getting me one of those swell
		pineapple kabobs.

				GEORGE
		Oh sure ... You bet.
			(calling out)
		Betty ...

	There is no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)
			(louder this time)
		BETTY ...

	Still no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR
		GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ...

	WIDER.

	George turns around to see David, standing on the landing,
	listening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a
	moment ...

				DAVID
		I'll get her.

	He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across
	the room to see:

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	Betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the
	window. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen
	counter.

				DAVID
			(approaching slowly)
		Are you okay?

	She doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on
	her shoulder.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Are you alright?

	Betty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED
	COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED.
	SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole
	thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the
	tear stains on either side of her face.

				BETTY
			(fighting tears)
		What am I going to do?

	David moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering.

				DAVID
		It's okay. It's alright.

				BETTY
			(trembling)
		I can't go out there. How can I go out
		there?

	She looks right up at David.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(quieter)
		Look at me ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear
	and confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile.

				DAVID
		Have you got any make up?

				BETTY
		In my handbag.

	He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits
	Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for
	her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.

				DAVID
		Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.

	He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude,
	Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY
	powder puff.

	CLOSER.

	It is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup,
	she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones
	disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a
	DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.

	REVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.

	He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back.
	All at once, David seems to wince:

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.

	The life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone
	from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the
	fictional version of herself all over again.

				BETTY
			(off his reaction)
		What?

	David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the
	compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her
	face, turning her head first right, then left.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(beat)
		Does it look okay?

				DAVID
		Looks just like it did.

				BETTY
		And they won't be able to tell?

				DAVID
			(even quieter)
		No ... They won't be able to tell.

	Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the
	plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before
	she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide
	"stewardess" smile ...

				DAVID (CONT)
		Wait.

				BETTY
			(turning back)
		What?

	He wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his
	head.

				DAVID
		It's fine.

	She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.

				BETTY
		Thank you.

				DAVID
			(sadly)
		Sure.

	He watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room,
	extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of
	her ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. DAY.

	Mr. Johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin
	dispensers. He whistles BRUBECK'S "TAKE FIVE" when the screen
	door slams behind him. Mr. Johnson looks up with a start.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh, hi.

				DAVID
			(entering)
		Hi.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Aren't you a little early?

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		I brought you something ... From the
		library.

	CLOSER. FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three
	feet long. Mr. Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as
	David crosses to the counter.

				DAVID
		It's an art book.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh my Gosh, Bud ...

				DAVID
		Open it.

	Mr. Johnson reaches out and opens the cover. After a beat,
	his eyes widen.

				DAVID (CONT)
		I just thought since you liked
		painting it might help to ...

	Mr. Johnson gasps. It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a
	gasp. David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages.

	HIS POV. (INSERT) ART BOOK ...

	Massacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in
	vibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset
	by their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE ...

	Titian's "Venus to Utano". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden
	light. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of
	her flesh almost seem to glow ...

	Rembrandt's "Self Portrait." Dark reds, umbers, blacks and
	browns. He looks back at Mr. Johnson with pain and wisdom.
	There's a brilliant light on his hair.

				MR. JOHNSON (OS)
		Mmmmgh ...

	Faintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA
	begins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be
	sure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with
	your eyes.

	He TURNS THE PAGES faster. Breugal's "Harvesters" ... Tumees
	"Steam Train" ... Monet's "Cathedralo" ... Cezanne's
	"Oranges" ... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.

	WIDER. SODA SHOP.

	They sit like that for a beat.

				MR. JOHNSON
		It's beautiful, Bud ...

	He looks up at David, troubled.

				DAVID
		What's wrong?

				MR. JOHNSON
		I'll never be able to do that.

				DAVID
		Oh, well--you're just starting out.
		I mean, you can't do it ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		No, that's not it.

	Mr. Johnson shuts the book gently.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Where am I going to see colors like
		that?

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	What can he say. David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just
	smiles and shrugs.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Must be awfully lucky to see colors
		like that. I bet they don't even know
		how lucky they are.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He just stares for a second.

	EXT. MAIN STREET. LONG SHOT. DAY.

	Margaret walks up the center of Main Street toward the CAMERA
	with her books pressed against her chest. She passes the
	drugstore, then the hardware store ... Far off in the
	distance, a young man comes racing out of the soda shop,
	pulling off his little paper hat as he goes. He comes running
	up behind her as fast as he can.

	CLOSER.

	He takes a deep breath and tries to quiet the panting.

				DAVID
		Hi.

				MARGARET
			(turning/
			lighting up)
		Oh ... Hi.

				DAVID
			(pause)
		Look, I probably shouldn't be asking
		you this--not knowing you that well
		and all ...

	Margaret stops in the street and turns to him.

				DAVID (CONT)
		It's just that my folks are gonna
		stay home and they said I could use
		their car.
			(moment of truth/
			abandoning his speech)
		... You want to go out with me
		tonight?

	He wants to turn away but doesn't. David forces himself to
	stare at her and all of a sudden she beams. It's the whitest,
	pearliest smile in the world.

				MARGARET
			(breathless)
		Sure ... Where would we go?

				DAVID
			(swallows)
		... Lover's Lane?

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. DAY.

	David comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation.
	He vaults over a parking meter, swings around a lampost and
	leaps off the bumper of a parked car. David hi-fives into the
	air at no one in particular and sails over Mr. Simpson's
	hedge almost decking him in the process.

				DAVID
			(calling back)
		Sorry ...

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All
	American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a
	time flinging open the door.

	INT. PARKER HOUSE. FOYER.

				DAVID
		"Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching
		in ..."

	He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron
	and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs,
	when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS)
		Bud ...

	He pauses a second and glances back.

				MAN'S VOICE (CONT)
		David ...

	He peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer ...

	HIS POV. TELEVISION.

	Dick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the
	TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Hello there.

				DAVID
			(wary)
		... Hi.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(stage whisper)
		Well c'mere, young fella.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David crosses slowly over to the TV set.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(big smile)
		You know I've been thinkin' ... I
		might have been a little "hasty"
		the other day when you asked to come
		home--just took me by such surprise,
		ya know--ha ha ...

	He gives a goony laugh. David just looks at him ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		So even though I can't make any
		promises, well--I figured if you
		asked me real nice--I might just be
		willing to talk about it again.

				DAVID
			(quickly)
		I can't.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What?

				DAVID
		Talk about it. Right now, I mean.
		I got to ... um ...

	The look turns suddenly dark and ominous.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Bud--I thought you wanted to come
		home.

				DAVID
		Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I
		told my "dad" I'd clean out the
		rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted
		me to ... to change the tape in the
		register ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(getting testy)
		I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm
		getting sorta concerned about what
		I'm seeing in some of these
		re-runs ...

				DAVID
		Re-runs?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Like when Margaret Henderson makes
		her cookies for Whitey.
			(losing it a little)
		... Those aren't your cookies Bud.

				DAVID
		Oh, I know they're not. But I mean--
		they're just "cookies" after all ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Excuse me?

				DAVID
		Well they're not just cookies. I
		mean, they're great cookies ...
		Look, I'd love to get into this
		whole thing but I'm really running
		late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		BUD.

				DAVID
		Terrific. I'll talk to you then.

	He swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic
	limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room,
	breathing hard ...

	INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM.

	She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a
	book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to
	open it when she senses something and glances toward the
	door.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems
	to be out of breath.

				JENNIFER
		What's wrong?

				DAVID
		Nothing.

				JENNIFER
		Nothing?

	He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the
	remote in his hand.

				DAVID
		Listen ...

	He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly
	stops.

				DAVID (CONT)
		You're reading?

				JENNIFER
			(glancing at the book)
		Yeah. Can't believe you started such
		a dorky fad.

	She holds up the cover.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?

				DAVID
			(amazed)
		... Yeah.

				JENNIFER
		Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35
		pages.

				DAVID
			(still stunned)
		That's great.

	He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to
	drift ...

				JENNIFER
		So what is it?

				DAVID
		Well ... I just ...
			(out of the blue)
		Can I ask you a question?

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				DAVID
		Remember when you told me that Lisa
		Rosenberg liked me?

				JENNIFER
		Yeah ...

				DAVID
		Well--did she really like me or were
		you just making that up.

				JENNIFER
		No. She really liked you.

				DAVID
		You weren't playing a joke? She
		woulda gone out with me?

				JENNIFER
		Gone out with you. She woulda like
		rearranged your tonsils.

				DAVID
		Wow.

	He looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity.

				JENNIFER
		Can I ask you a question?

				DAVID
		Yes.

				JENNIFER
		How come I'm still in black and white?

				DAVID
			(back to earth)
		What?

				JENNIFER
		Well I've had like ten times as
		much sex as these girls and I'm
		still like this. They have one hour
		in the back of a car and suddenly
		they're in technicolor.

				DAVID
		Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...
			(thinks)
		... it's not just the sex ...

				JENNIFER
			(looking up quickly)
		What?

	She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard
	their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's
	calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her
	expression changes: a vague look of recognition.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		No, it's not just the sex, is it?

	She glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes
	a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After
	a second or two, she looks back. David looks at her for a
	beat ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.

	David gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen
	"gray" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front
	walk ...

	INT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ...

	David sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret
	Henderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road,
	holding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his
	right.

	HIS POV. MARGARET.

	It's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes
	her glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm
	wind that swirls inside the convertible ...

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to
	avoid a parked car on his right ...

	WIDER.

	They pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads:

	"NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE"

	Main Street turns into a winding country road as they leave
	the town behind and head off into the woods. They wind
	through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a
	second sign appears, much like the first:

	"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE"

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

	Sure enough, the town emerges in front of them again,
	completing the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.

				MARGARET
		Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

				DAVID
		Oh ... Right.

	He looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.

	EXT. CAR. DUSK.

	SAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto
	a smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small
	hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road.
	It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the
	crest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a
	deep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat
	between them ...

	HIS POV. CAR SEAT.

	THE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They
	sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ...

	INT. CAR.

	David looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems
	to be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have
	started to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty
	percent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false
	spring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as
	they finally reach a crest in the hill.

				DAVID
		Wow.

	THEIR POV. LOVERS LANE.

	There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone
	Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW
	IS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS (all "turned" now)
	SWIRL IN THE WIND LIKE SOME STRANGE PINK SNOWSTORM. A LONG
	LINE OF PASTEL CARS STRETCHES OUT ALONG THE SHORE.

				SAM COOKE (VO)
			(over the car radios)
		"Cupid, draw back your bow ..."

	SHOT. CAR.

	Slowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids
	have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by
	the edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It
	almost looks "Athenian."

	INT. CAR.

	David looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly
	cocks his head to the side.

				DAVID
		What's that smell?

	Margaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the
	convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is
	blooming beside the car.

				MARGARET
		Aren't these great?

	David takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes
	a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to
	relax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like
	some strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the
	flower ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK.

	Betty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on
	either hand. From a block away, she looks like any other
	homemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray
	make-up.

	CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.

	She nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in
	the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street
	when she glances up, and suddenly stops.

	HER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.

	There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda
	shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for
	the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It
	is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks
	like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject
	matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres
	and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist
	Santa hovering over the roof tops.

	SHOT. BETTY.

	She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to
	wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the
	business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of
	the block, staring straight ahead.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	The door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the
	place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining
	through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances
	around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.

				MR. JOHNSON (OS)
		We're closed right now ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a
	board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his
	shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh, hi ...

				BETTY
			(turning to leave)
		I'm sorry ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		No, no ... Come on in.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still
	holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist
	Christmas" in the window.

				BETTY
		I just thought ... It's beautiful.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Thanks.

	Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr.
	Johnson motions toward his easel.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		I was just trying to do one of these
		"still lifes."

	He sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of
	GRAY FRUIT.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Having kind of a tough time.

				BETTY
		I think it looks nice.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well ...
			(shrugs)
		Here's what it's s'posed to look like.

	He leads her over to the table and points down at the art
	book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.

				BETTY
		Oh my ...

	CLOSER.

	They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at
	the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears
	into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Here. Look at this.

	He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is
	nearly electric.

				BETTY
			(breathless)
		Where'd you get this?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Bud brought it to me.

				BETTY
		Bud?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Here's my favorite.

	INSERT. BOOK.

	He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping
	Women." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her
	head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own
	shoulder.

				MR. JOHNSON
		What do you think?

	She doesn't answer ...

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Isn't it great how she's resting like
		that?

				BETTY
			(faintly)
		She's crying.

	WIDER.

	Mr. Johnson looks down at the painting.

				MR. JOHNSON
		What?

				BETTY
		She's crying.

				MR. JOHNSON
		No she's not.

				BETTY
		Yes she is.

	He looks up at her ...

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it
	and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just
	wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP.
	A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.

	ANGLE. MR. JOHNSON.

	He stares up at her in amazement.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She senses something and glances down at her hand. Her
	fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts
	for the door.

	WIDER.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(following her)
		Wait ...

				BETTY
		I've got to go ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		It's alright.

	He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the
	wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		It's alright. Let me see.

				BETTY
			(shame)
		No ...

	He reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves
	around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.

				MR. JOHNSON
		It's beautiful.

	CLOSER ...

	She freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly,
	turns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed
	underneath. Betty stands there exposed.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(a whisper)
		... It's beautiful.

	She swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		You shouldn't cover that up.

	Mr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on
	the counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at
	the tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he
	starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.

	CLOSER STILL ...

	She recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr.
	Johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and
	acceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make
	a decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing
	her flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues
	to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the
	beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...

								CUT TO:
	INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT.

	She lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing
	earlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the
	pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a
	moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting
	the book. The cover is plainly visible: "LADY CHATTERLY'S
	LOVER."

	CLOSER.

	She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed
	and crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens
	the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and
	doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She
	could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the
	little desk.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	She flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is
	bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony
	tail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired
	and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer
	notices something across the desk.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of
	her. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances
	back down at the print.

				JENNIFER
			(impressed)
		Hunh.

	She can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in
	front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked
	the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER
	FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is
	the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look
	on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel
	when there is a loud TAP on the window.

	She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer
	slides open the window.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE.

	Biff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window.

				BIFF
		Mary Sue--C'mon ...

				JENNIFER
			(leaning out the window)
		What are you doing?

				BIFF
			(jiggling in anticipation)
		It's six-thirty ...

				JENNIFER
		So.

				BIFF
		We were gonna ... You know ...

	He jiggles some more.

				JENNIFER
		Oh.
			(remembering)
		I can't.

				BIFF
		Why not?

	She glances down at her book.

				JENNIFER
		I'm busy.

				BIFF
			(surprised)
		With what?

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk. Her
	own image in the silver frame stares back at her. The hair is
	pulled back in a pony tail. The glasses sit on the front of
	her nose.

				JENNIFER
			(turning to Biff)
		I'm studying.

	She thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles. Biff
	stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and
	quietly closes the window ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out
	across the water. Even in the moonlight, the COLORS are
	vivid. David still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking
	a long hit like an Opium addict.

				DAVID
			(inhaling)
		Mmmmgh.

				MARGARET
		Do they have those ... Where you come
		from?

				DAVID
		Yeah ... I guess.
			(beat)
		I don't know.

				MARGARET
		You don't know?

	Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on
	the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a
	long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her
	shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.

				MARGARET (CONT)
		So what's it like?

				DAVID
		What?

				MARGARET
			(a whisper)
		Out there.

	She clings onto the words like they could transport her by
	themselves. David thinks for a moment.

				DAVID
		Oh. don't know ... It's different.

	She leans forward.

				MARGARET
		How?

				DAVID
		Well it's louder ... And scarier I
		guess ... And ... and a lot more
		dangerous ...

				MARGARET
		Sounds fantastic. You know some kids
		came up here the other night to go
		swimming--took off all their clothes.

	She giggles. David looks at her in amazement.

				MARGARET (CONT)
		Do they have an Ocean? I've heard
		about the ocean.

				DAVID
		Yeah.

				MARGARET
		What's that like?

				DAVID
		Well it's big. And it's blue ...
			(as if realizing it for the first time)
		... It's really really blue.

				MARGARET
		Mmmm.
			(beat)
		Boy. It's hot up here.

	Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan
	sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the
	figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts.
	She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it
	forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater
	across the grass and leans back on it.

				MARGARET (CONT)
		You want some berries?

				DAVID
		Hunh?

	She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in
	REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES.

				MARGARET
		I picked them myself. They grow wild
		up here.
			(eating one)
		Mmm. So sweet.

				DAVID
			(looking at them)
		They just grow like that?

				MARGARET
			(looking straight up)
		Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff.
		Currants and strawberries ... Here.
		I'll show you.

	She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her
	heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and
	reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a
	piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers
	back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ...

				MARGARET (CONT)
		Here.

	CLOSER.

	Margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED
	APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the
	moonlight.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a
	whisper.

				MARGARET
		Go on. Try it.

	HIS POV.

	She is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched
	apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is
	smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David
	reaches out and takes it.

	WIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET.

	For this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks
	down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates
	for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	George heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a
	happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache
	case as he turns and heads up his front walk.

	INT. FOYER.

	George opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs
	like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his
	coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly
	greeting:

				GEORGE
		Honey--I'm home.

	There is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles
	as he calls out again:

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Honey--I'm home ...

	There is more silence. George looks around a little confused
	when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	Betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of
	fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully
	with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel,
	painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks
	radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER
	FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ...

	CLOSER.

	She looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP
	OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER
	BOOM ...

	ANGLE. WINDOW.

	The "Cubist Snowscene" lights up brightly, illuminated by the
	sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the
	chair and crosses to the window looking out.

				BETTY
			(frightened)
		What is that?

				MR. JOHNSON
		I don't know.

	Betty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the
	painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide.

	REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING.

	It is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that
	isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him
	fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual
	nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself
	revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges
	and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime.
	There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER.

	WIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON.

	She looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a
	moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to
	run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing
	it, moves slightly closer.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At
	first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF
	THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the
	RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in
	the sky.

				MARGARET
		What is that?

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the
	increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks
	to him in terror.

				MARGARET
		What's going on?

				DAVID
		Rain.

				MARGARET
		Real rain?

				DAVID
		Yeah ... You don't have rain either?

	She looks at him frightened. David smiles.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Right. Of course you don't ...

	He puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the
	grassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank,
	looking in terror at the water falling from the sky.

				MARGARET
		What do we do?

				DAVID
			(reaching the car)
		We'll just put up the top.

	He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the
	catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing
	around as the rain starts to pound harder.

				MARGARET
		What top?

	He looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched
	in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to
	shiver.

				DAVID
		It's fine. Come on.

	He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the
	kids are clustered together. They look at one another,
	terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an
	overhanging rock.

				DAVID (CONT)
		It's alright. There's nothing to be
		afraid of.

	They look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him
	positively adoringly. She clings to his shoulder as the storm
	howls a few feet away ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. NIGHT.

	She stands at the window looking out at the driving rain.
	Jennifer still holds the D.H. Lawrence book in her hand.
	There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of
	thunder.

				JENNIFER
		Cool ...

	She flops back down on the bed and continues to read ...

	PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	George wanders through the empty and darkened house
	completely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around
	for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms
	and the sound of the driving storm.

				GEORGE
			(a little frightened/
			a little petulant)
		Honey, I'm home ...

	He still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM.
	The lights are dark there as well and he looks around
	confused.

				GEORGE (CONT)
			(baffled)
		Where's my dinner?

	He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking
	smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's
	empty as well.

	KITCHEN.

	He crosses into the darkness ...

				GEORGE
		Where's my dinner ...

	INT. FOYER.

	George comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer. He
	slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going ...

				GEORGE
			(insistent)
		Where's my DINNER ...

	EXT. HOUSE.

	It's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy
	sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind. The front door
	opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still
	dressed in his shirtsleeves.

				GEORGE
		Where's my DINNER!

	ON GEORGE.

	He stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete
	confusion. The rain pounds against his body and within
	seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin.

				GEORGE
			(over the storm)
		WHERE'S MY DINNER ...

	EXT. ELM STREET.

	A tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling
	through the torrent. George reels down Elm Street screaming
	skyward in the distance.

				GEORGE
		... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY
		DINNER!

	SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE ...

	He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance
	agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he
	passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ...
	Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well
	with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain.
	George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened
	shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ...

				GEORGE
			(plaintively)
		Where's my dinner?

	He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk.

	INT. BOWLING ALLEY. NIGHT.

	The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across
	three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt,
	sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses.

	The NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there
	aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...

	ANGLE. BIG BOB.

	He picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He
	starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up
	and suddenly stops.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	George is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold
	and shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His
	hair is drenched and dripping.

				BOB
		What happened?

	He doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps
	shivering.

	WIDER.

	The men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a
	couple of times, still soaked to the bone.

				BOB
		Are you alright?
			(looking at him)
		What is it?

				GEORGE
			(faintly)
		Rain.

				BOB
			(beat)
		Real rain?

	George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling
	alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning
	lights up the sky.

				BOB (CONT)
		Oh my God ...

	He turns back to George.

				BOB (CONT)
		... We had no idea. Burt was rolling
		a 250 and ...
			(beat)
		Are you alright?

	George shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches
	and guides him into the seat ...

				BOB (CONT)
		What happened?

				GEORGE
			(still shivering)
		Well, I ... I came home like I always
		do, And I came in the front door. And
		I took off my coat. And I put down my
		briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."

	ANGLE. MEN.

	They all nod in recognition.

	ANGLE. GEORGE.

				GEORGE
		... Only no one was there.

	A MURMUR goes through the men.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		So I went into the kitchen and I
		yelled it again. "Honey--I'm home."
		But there was no one there either.
		No wife. No lights. No dinner.

	They all GASP.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		So I went to the oven--you know--
		because I thought maybe she had made
		me one of those "TV dinners ..."

	The men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		But she hadn't. She was gone.

	A LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his
	head and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up
	and puts a hand on his shoulder.

				BOB
			(gently/
			the patriarch)
		... It's gonna be fine George.

	George looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly
	on the back.

				GUS
		What do we do Bob?

				BOB
		Well--we'll be safe for now--thank
		goodness we're in a bowling alley--
		but if George here doesn't get his
		dinner, any one of us could be next.
		It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or
		even you Phil ...

	They murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam.

				BOB (CONT)
			(like a WWII movie)
		... That's real rain out there
		gentlemen. This isn't some little
		"virus" that's going to "clear up on
		it's own." There's something
		happening to our town and I think we
		can all see where it comes from.

	They nod in agreement.

				BOB (CONT)
		We're gonna need a town meeting.
		Phil, how fast can you turn around
		a leaflet in your print shop?

				PHIL
		Couple of hours.

				BOB
		Gus, why don't you get a bunch of
		kids from the basketball team to help
		you put them up on lamposts and tree
		trunks ...

	Gus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm,
	patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder.

				BOB (CONT)
			(soothingly)
		And the first thing you're gonna do
		is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice
		dry bowling shirt.

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	The rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson
	are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through
	Mr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft
	radiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow
	pink ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		You can't go out there.

				BETTY
		But I really should get home.

				MR. JOHNSON
		But you can't go out there.

	There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of
	THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her
	eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the
	roof.

				BETTY
		Sounds nice ... Once you get used
		to it.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(listening)
		Yeah. It does.

	There is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this
	time.

				BETTY
		Like a drum.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Yeah.
			(thinks)
		Or like sprinklers in the summer ...

	Betty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear
	seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as
	Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr.
	Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two.
	Betty starts to smile ...

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

	David huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she
	nestles against him with her head on his shoulder.

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting
	image of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses
	have slipped down her nose. There is another fork of
	lightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer
	smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her
	shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page.

								CUT TO:

	CLOSE UP. A BRIGHT RED ROSE.

	Drops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT
	RED IN THE MORNING SUN ...

	AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE.

	The rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight
	complete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky.
	Literally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the
	black and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	Betty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each
	other's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming
	Mr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens
	his eyes and looks outside ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(seeing the rainbow)
		Oh my Gosh ...

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

	Birds are chirping. David and Margaret also lie asleep in
	each other's arms, beneath the shelter of the rocky overhang.
	Margaret lifts up and sees the rainbow. She has turned to
	color as well ...

				MARGARET
			(awed)
		Oh my God ...

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest.
	Jennifer's hair is still tied in a bun and she still wears
	Mary Sue's glasses, but her face has returned to its rosy
	pink hue. She blinks open her eyes, feeling the sunlight, and
	looks out the window.

				JENNIFER
			(looking at the rainbow)
		Oh my God ...

	INT. BOWLING ALLEY.

	The men are all passed out across the various lanes and
	scoring tables. It looks like a YMCA shelter. After a moment
	or two Big Bob yawns, and stretches, and glances out the
	glass doorway. He sees the rainbow and freezes in shock.

				BOB
			(horrified)
		Oh my GOD!

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM ST. DAY.

	David comes gliding up Maple Street in the sunshine with a
	huge smile on his face. He has that special grin and faraway
	look that a boy only knows once in his life. Perplexingly he
	is still in black and white. Bud turns on Elm Street and
	starts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly
	freezes.

	HIS POV. TREE TRUNK.

	There, tacked to the bark, is a hastily scrawled public
	notice:

	TOWN MEETING TONIGHT
	ALL "TRUE" CITIZENS
	OF PLEASANTVILLE

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He looks up at it for a moment.

	INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DUSK.

	George and Betty stand face to face in their suburban
	kitchen. He is black and white. She is in full color.

				BETTY
		I told you where I was.

				GEORGE
		All night?

				BETTY
		I got caught in the storm. You were
		gone all night too.

				GEORGE
			(the ultimate defense)
		I was in a bowling-alley.

	Betty turns--glances out the window.

				GEORGE (CONT)
			(sudden smile)
		Look. Let's just forget about it.
		Let's just go to the meeting and ...

				BETTY
		I told you, George. I'm not going.

				GEORGE
			(bigger smile)
		Sure you are.

				BETTY
		No I'm not.

	She turns to face him. George flinches slightly.

				BETTY (CONT)
		Look at me George. That meeting's not
		for me. Look at my face.

				GEORGE
		It's fine. You'll put on some make up
		and ...

				BETTY
		I don't want to put on some make up ...

	George's eyes widen. It's a watershed moment.

				GEORGE
			(protesting)
		It goes away ... It'll go away.

				BETTY
			(gently)
		I don't want it to go away.

	He suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his
	chest.

				GEORGE
			(the '50s patriarch)
		Okay--now you listen to me ...
			(beat)
		You're gonna come to this meeting and
		you're gonna put on this make up, and
		you're gonna come home at six o'clock
		every night and have dinner ready on
		this table.

				BETTY
			(softly)
		No I'm not sweetie.

	His expression leaves as quickly as it came. Betty moves
	closer to him.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(half whisper)
		... There's a meatloaf in the fridge.
		You just put it in the oven and turn
		this little knob up to three-fifty.
		If you put the pie in forty minutes
		later, it'll be hot in time for
		dessert.

	George's eyes widen.

				BETTY (CONT)
		I made a couple of lunches for you
		and put them in brown paper bags ...
			(much quieter)
		I'm gonna go now.

				GEORGE
		Where are you gonna go?

				BETTY
		I'm gonna go now.

	She turns and starts out the kitchen door when George calls
	after her.

				GEORGE
		Betty, don't go out there like that!
		They'll see you!
			(beat)
		They'll SEE you!

	And she closes the door behind her.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Betty, come back here!

	EXT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

	Dozens of black and white citizens stream in through the
	front door.

	SHOT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET.

	Several "transformed" teenagers stare at the spectacle with
	their FLESH COLORED SKIN AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES. They seem to
	hang back in the shadows.

	INT. TOWN HALL.

	Big Bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that
	reads "PLEASANTVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE." As the only
	legally constituted body in Pleasantville, it is a natural
	place for a town meeting. There is nothing bright and cheery
	however. The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming
	shadows up the walls. The light at the podium bathes Big
	Bob's face in a blinding splash of light. The whole thing
	evokes some weird twisted image from German Expressionism--
	like they are about to go look for Frankenstein. It is grayer
	than gray.

	CLOSER. PODIUM.

	Big Bob stands at a lectern with a Rotary insignia on the
	front. He speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and
	women who hang on his every word. Bob holds a BRIGHT YELLOW
	GRAPEFRUIT.

				BOB
		This was found over in Dave Murphy's
		trash can. There were four of them
		like this ...

	There is a murmur from the crowd ...

	CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

	He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind
	Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a
	full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic
	and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a
	shiny new pin can give you.

	SHOT. BOB.

	He holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS.

				BOB
		Jane Davidson found these in her
		son's laundry basket.

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats.
	Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair.

				BOB (CONT)
		This is from Mary Petersen's front
		porch. She found one last week.
		There were two more this morning ...

	The MURMUR starts to grow ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside
	Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap
	their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The
	meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a
	moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a
	beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright
	RED bow.

				DAVID
			(softly)
		I got you something.

	Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the
	wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real
	umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled.

				MARGARET
		It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?

				DAVID
		It was a prop for the school play ...

	She looks down and giggles.

				MARGARET
		Can I open it?

				DAVID
		Sure ...

	Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She
	puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of
	pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points
	her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a
	summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the
	corner.

	WIDER.

	David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret
	looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and
	two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with
	BLACK AND WHITE faces ...

				DRIVER
		Hello Bud ...

				DAVID
			(clipped)
		Hello Whitey.

	They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and
	arrogant.

				WHITEY
			(more pointed)
		Hello Margaret.

				MARGARET
		Hello Whitey ...

				WHITEY
			(loud)
		Hey Bud, how come you're not at
		the town meeting right now?

				DAVID
			(curt)
		No reason.
			(pause/
			firing back)
		How come you're not?

				WHITEY
		Oh. We're s'posed to go out and
		let everybody know about it. See.

	He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of
	Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and
	leers ...

				WHITEY (CONT)
		No reason hunh ... See I thought
		maybe it was cause you were too
		busy entertaining your colored
		girlfriend.

	Margaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF
	LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around
	her and pulls her close.

				DAVID
		Why don't you guys just get the
		hell out of here.

				WHITEY
		Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that.

	He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns
	toward Margaret.

				WHITEY (CONT)
			(leering more)
		You know Margaret, you can come
		over and bake those Oatmeal cookies
		for me anytime you want to.

	They share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels
	out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David
	holds her tighter ...

				DAVID
		It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.

	She nods, groping for reassurance ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

	The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing.
	Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the
	audience.

				WOMAN
		Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.

				ED MCFADDEN
		It's always been blue!

				WOMAN
		Not that blue!

				MAN
		There's a big tree turning orange
		in Joe Baker's front yard!

	SHOT. GEORGE.

	He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on
	his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ...

				BOB
		People, people ... I think we all
		know what's going on here.

	SHOT. BOB.

	Bob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit.

				BOB
		Obviously certain "changes" have
		been happening. Up until now, things
		in Pleasantville have always been--
		well ... "Pleasant." And, recently,
		certain things have become ...
		"Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me
		the first thing we have to do is to
		separate out the things that are
		pleasant, from the things that are
		"Un-Pleasant."

	There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ...

				BOB (CONT)
		George, why don't you and Burt
		take the lead on this. Why don't
		you put together kind of an
		"Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	Mr. Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and
	stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass. There is a
	knock at the door ...

	WIDER.

	Mr. Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it.
	Betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a
	"Lady Samsonite Weekender" bag. She stares up into his eyes.

								DISSOLVE TO:

	FULL SHOT. SHOP WINDOW. MORNING.

	Burt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every
	morning, only today there is a slight difference. He swings
	open the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a
	newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window:

	"NO COLOREDS"

	SERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS.

	As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more
	"NO COLOREDS" signs appear in the windows: next to the
	donuts ... by fishing poles ... beside the stationery
	supplies ... Everything else looks frighteningly the same...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

	Joey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning
	rounds. He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the
	bakery. Then he throws right toward the post office. Then he
	turns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams
	into a trash can ...

	WIDER. SODA SHOP.

	Where Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene,
	there is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A
	NUDE version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in
	curving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just
	stares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he
	possibly can ...

								CUT TO:

	MAIN STREET. LATER ...

	David is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and
	doesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr. Johnson's
	soda shop. After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the
	window ...

	CLOSER. DAVID.

	His eyes go wide. The murmur of the crowd grows louder as
	stray derisive comments rise above the noise. David glances
	from the nude in window to the growing angry mob ...

	MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David goes tearing through the business district looking for
	any sign of his "mother." He glances in the flower shop ...
	toward the green grocer ... David is just about to turn on
	Elm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the
	sky ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (OS)
		Bud ...

	David stops and looks to his right. There, in the window of
	the Philco TV store, are twenty screens of various sizes
	displaying the image of Dick Van Dyke.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		I want a word with you ...

				DAVID
			(scared)
		Oh--well ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(BOOMING)
		NOW!

	The sound reverberates like God Himself. David ducks inside
	the store, slamming the door behind him.

	INT. STORE.

	Fifty Dick Van Dyke's stare at him from every TV in the
	store. The effect is smothering.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(still pretty loud)
		What the hell do you think you're
		doing!

	David glances around, not sure where to look.

				DAVID
			(terrified)
		What do you mean?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What do I MEAN!
			(beat)
		You think this is a toy? You think
		it's your own little goddamn
		coloring book ...

				DAVID
		Look--it just sort of "happened" ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		A deluge doesn't just "happen."
		Bolts of lightning don't just
		"happen" ...
			(louder)
		You burned down an ELM tree for
		Christ's sake ...

				DAVID
		I had nothing to do with that.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory.
		What episode does the orgy happen
		in, again?

				DAVID
		Look ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		It was a gift Bud. It was so
		special. You liked these things
		as much as I did, remember:
		Warm smells in the family kitchen?
		A smile from a stranger? You know
		how rare that is?

				DAVID
			(beat/
			quietly)
		... Only if they mean it.

	Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the
	face.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING
		TO PISS ME OFF!

				DAVID
			(finding courage)
		I didn't do anything wrong.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh no? Let me show you something!

	SHOT. TV SCREEN.

	All at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of
	the screen containing the image of David and Margaret at
	Lover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the
	BRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts
	it to his mouth and takes a bite.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		"YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE."

	The image of David biting the apple PLAYS BACKWARDS AND
	FORWARDS like some football instant replay ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS
		PARADISE!

	WIDER.

	David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on
	the TV screens.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(quickly)
		Where's the remote control I gave
		you?

				DAVID
		Why?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Because you're coming home. I'm
		gonna put this place back the way
		it was.

				DAVID
		No you're not.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		EXCUSE ME?

				DAVID
			(gathering strength)
		I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(nuts)
		JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!

	He lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the
	"barrier."

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		OW!

				DAVID
			(terrified)
		I'm going to leave now.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		You're not going anywhere. You're
		gonna get that remote and you're
		gonna come home and we're gonna
		make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!

	Dick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves
	the shop.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Don't make me get rough with you!
		I can get awfully fucking rough!

	ELM STREET. DAY.

	David sprints down the tree lined street toward his house.
	The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN
	even this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's
	hedge and goes tearing up his front walk.

	INT. FOYER.

	The door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David
	glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He
	crosses into the living room.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at
	it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.

	MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to
	stash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville
	Travel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various
	destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't
	see much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a
	drain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the
	street.

	WIDER.

	David turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main
	Street. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to
	his feet as the voices get louder.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a
	group of young men who circle around her, taunting and
	harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:
	BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd
	circles her like a pack of dogs.

	CLOSER. BETTY.

	The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the
	black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high
	with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one
	another "Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's
	under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her
	picture ..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she
	quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to
	the ground ...

	WIDER.

	David shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into
	the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the
	side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is
	as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)
	David steps in front of his "mother" with both fists
	clenched.

				DAVID
			(as scared as she is)
		Come on!

	He plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black
	and white thugs just stares at it.

				DAVID (CONT)
		COME ON!

	ANGLE. CROWD.

	They look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the
	side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running
	down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts
	backing away.

				DAVID
		Get out of here!

	They back away further and David takes a threatening step.
	The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother."

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER)

	David moves up to her gently.

				DAVID
		Are you alright?

	She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David
	reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go
	wide.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(off her look)
		What?

	CLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER.

	Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She
	opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected
	image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID.

	He holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The
	courage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look
	at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle
	arm around her shoulder.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		Come on.

	He begins to lead her up toward the corner.

								CUT TO:

	FULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY.

	A larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude
	painting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are
	even louder. The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway.
	After a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ...

	WIDER.

	A big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the
	fever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an
	instant, Mr. Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed. The
	CHEERING grows louder ...

	Almost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together.
	The door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon
	all that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND
	BROKEN GLASS.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	It is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables
	ripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick
	in the front of the juke box ...

	EXT. MAIN ST. DAY.

	David and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being
	destroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection
	watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok.
	After a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET
	comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped
	open.

				DAVID
		Oh my God.

	He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David
	strokes her hair.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Are you alright? Are you okay?

	She nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two,
	then glances down to her side ...

	WIDER.

	She is clutching the umbrella in her left hand. The thing has
	been ripped to shreds. The spines are broken and the fabric
	is torn. Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of
	confusion and shame. David goes white with rage and looks
	toward the mob.

				BETTY
			(taking his arm)
		No. Let's get out of here.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. (LEADING TO LOVER'S LANE).

	They all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning
	road. It has turned completely PINK with the dogwood petals.
	David winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for
	refuge. He clutches the wheel tight.

				DAVID
		We should be okay up here.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

	The car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road. After a
	moment, Lover's Lane reveals itself. It is lush and green
	like before only this time, there is one major difference. A
	phalanx of BLACK AND WHITE THUGS have created a roadblock in
	the foreground.

	WIDER.

	David jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier. It is a
	weird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in
	front with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind--
	like some perfect dream you can never get to. The thugs have
	turned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs
	across the road. They hold axe-handles in their hands.

				DAVID
			(a whisper)
		We better go.

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	Darkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on. Some
	debris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of
	the mob still fill the air. David rolls back into town with
	the headlights off.

	CLOSER. CAR.

				MARGARET
		Where are they?

				DAVID
		I'm not sure.

	They head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at
	once, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. THEIR POV.

	A BONFIRE has been lit in the middle of the street between the
	library and the barber shop. Twenty to thirty people are
	gathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright
	ORANGE FLAMES shoot into the air.

	ANGLE. CAR.

	David pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide ...

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	From closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning. Huge
	piles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,
	waiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory
	atmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with
	the glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker. David sees
	something and bolts from the car ...

				DAVID
		Oh my God.

	ANGLE. SIDE OF THE BONFIRE.

	Jennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff.
	He clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist
	trying to stop him from throwing it on the fire ...

				JENNIFER
		Don't! Just let go.

				BIFF
		It's better, Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
		I said, NO!
			(yanking it)
		... I've read like one book in my
		whole life and I'll be damned if I
		let you throw it on that fire ...

	Jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then
	suddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony
	when Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other
	direction.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET.

	She sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop
	when a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to
	scream but David puts a hand to her mouth.

				DAVID
			(a whisper)
		It's okay. It's me.

								CUT TO:

	WIDE SHOT. SODA SHOP. OTHER SIDE OF MAIN STREET.

	The crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark
	wreckage of the soda shop. Several stools lie out in the
	street and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered
	around the sidewalk. It is eerily quiet.

	WIDER.

	David, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the
	street with the lights off. He unlatches the door handle and
	gets out slowly. The rest of them follow him into the empty
	street as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some
	platoon on patrol.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	As they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view. Half
	a booth ... a soda spigot ... After a moment or two Jennifer
	looks up and gasps.

	CLOSER.

	Several teenagers step out of the shadows. They have scraped
	faces and ripped clothing--the signs. Most are dazed and ALL
	OF THEM ARE IN COLOR. After a second or two, more appear:
	Mary Jane ... Lisa Anne ... The boy who was reading Huck
	Finn...

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	The kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of
	course he doesn't. The sounds of the Mob still carry through
	the air from somewhere off in the distance.

				DAVID
		Let's go inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	The place is just sad. All the remnants of what they had are
	strewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over. The
	stools are ripped out of the floor. Betty looks over at the
	corner where he painted her ... The easel is smashed to bits.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around
	her and draws her close. After a moment or two they HEAR a
	weird SCRAPING sound.

				DAVID
		Hello?

	The SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and
	after a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and
	dustpan.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Just thought I'd try to tidy it up
		a bit.

	Betty runs across and throws her arms around him. The
	teenagers watch as she holds him tight.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		It's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll
		be alright again ...

	Betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. No one says
	anything while they just embrace for a moment. Finally ...

				DAVID
		Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn
		these booths back up. "Mary Sue",
		why don't you help me slide this in
		front of the door. We'll be okay in
		here.

	They respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids
	start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage.
	Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as
	the kids try to put their shop back together.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT.

	Big Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The
	atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a
	lynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills.
	Bob points his finger.

				BOB
		This is not the answer people.

	The crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern.

				BOB (CONT)
		No matter how upset we may get, or
		how frustrated we may be, we're
		not gonna solve our problems out
		in the street. It's just the wrong
		way to do it. We have to have a
		"Code of Conduct" we can all agree
		to live by.

	His tone grows softer--more concerned ...

				BOB (CONT)
		Now, I asked George and Burt here
		to sketch out some ideas-and I
		think they've done a terrific job.
			(beat/
			scans the crowd)
		If we all agree on these then we
		can take a vote and I think we'll
		start to move in the right direction.

	ANGLE. CROWD.

	They murmur and nod ...

				BOB
			(reading from the
			CODE OF CONDUCT")
		"ONE: All public disruption and
		acts of vandalism are to cease
		immediately."

	EXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT.

	It is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in
	VOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb.

	SHOT. FIRETRUCK.

	The same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls
	several yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely
	contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and
	extinguish the raging bonfire ...

				BOB
		"TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville
		are to treat one another in a
		courteous and "pleasant" manner ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS.

	The CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in
	rapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop
	windows ...

	SODA SHOP.

	Debris is still strewn around the street. A dim light
	emanates from inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	It looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to
	fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads
	the code of conduct out loud by flashlight.

				LISA ANNE
		"Courteous and Pleasant manner."
		That doesn't sound too bad.

	David just looks at her then continues.

				DAVID
			(reading from THE CODE)
		"THREE: The area commonly known as
		Lover's Lane as well as the
		Pleasantville Public Library shall
		be closed until further notice."

	This sends a murmur amongst the kids.

				DAVID (CONT)
		"FOUR: The only permissible
		recorded music shall be the
		following: Pat Boone, Johnny
		Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones,
		The marches of John Phillips
		Souza or the Star Spangled
		Banner. In no event shall any
		music be tolerated that is not of
		a temperate or "pleasant" nature."

				VARIOUS KIDS
			(overlapping)
		"Oh my gosh ... No ..."

	David holds up his hand.

				DAVID
		"FIVE: There shall be no public
		sale of umbrellas or preparation
		for inclement weather of any kind."

	Various glances dart back and forth between them. David
	continues.

				DAVID (CONT)
		"SIX: No bedframe or mattress may
		be sold measuring more than 38
		inches wide."
			(pause)
		"SEVEN: The only permissible exterior
		paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or
		GRAY, despite the recent availability
		of certain alternatives."

	David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly.
	Betty clutches his hand.

				DAVID (CONT)
		"EIGHT: All elementary and high
		school curriculums shall teach the
		"non-changist" view of history--
		emphasizing "continuity" over
		"alteration."
			(David pauses)
		Wow.

	David lowers the paper.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	It is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a
	moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares
	down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of
	sadness.

	Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling
	with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was
	being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.

				BOY
		Hey. This thing works.

	He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop.
	RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive
	time.

				BUDDY HOLLY
		Well all the things that you say
		and do Make me want to be with
		you-oo-oo ...

				LISA ANNE
			(suddenly/
			in a panic)
		Turn that off!

	The boy looks back at her.

				LISA ANNE (CONT)
			(shrieking)
		You're not allowed to do that now!

	He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox
	winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it.
	David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear
	tone.

				DAVID
		Sure you are.

	He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids
	watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.

	WIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.

	Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly
	different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to
	an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious
	reputation.

				BUDDY HOLLY
		The little things that you say and do
		Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ...
		RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ...
		RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...

	Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an
	arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little
	safer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they
	don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel
	ashamed.

	Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE
	ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the
	helm of his ship ...

	EXT. STREET. LATER ...

	He steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David
	motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge.
	The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is
	silent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids.

				DAVID
			(whisper)
		Stick together till you get off
		Main Street.

	They nod and head off down the block. David just watches them
	silently from the wreckage of the soda shop ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT.

	The Fire Department is cleaning up the charred remains of the
	bonfire ...

	INT. SODA SHOP. LATER ...

	Betty is asleep in one of the booths. Jennifer sleeps beside
	her on the floor. David and Margaret sleep next to them in
	another booth with Margaret curled up against his chest.
	David opens his eyes.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	Mr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at
	the large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He
	just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it.
	There's a faraway look in his eye.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret.
	David crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.

				DAVID
		It's okay. We'll get you a new one.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(softly)
		I don't know what I'd do if I
		couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just
		don't know what I'd do ...

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He
	picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just
	looks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks
	for a second.

				DAVID
		Maybe I have an idea.

								CUT TO:
	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAWN.

	The same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down
	Main Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws
	right toward the post office, then left toward the hardware
	store, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.

	CLOSER.

	This time the boy slams into a lamp post. He tumbles off his
	bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief ...

	HIS POV. TOWN HALL.

	Two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of
	paint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST
	UTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR.
	Instead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life.
	The post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky
	shines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town
	could look like. David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to
	their own signatures. David opens his eyes and sees the
	paperboy ...

	ANGLE. PAPER BOY.

	He turns around and rides away as fast as he can.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. LATER ...

	A huge crowd has gathered. There is a loud buzz in the air.
	David and Mr. Johnson stand side by side in front of their
	work like they're presenting and guarding it at the same
	time.

	REVERSE ANGLE. CROWD.

	Most of the faces are black and white. A few near the back
	are in color. Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd,
	hurriedly buttoning his shirt. The buzz grows and the people
	part as he heads toward the front of the pack ...

	ANGLE. FRONT OF CROWD.

	When Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr. Johnson flinches
	slightly. David just looks him in the eye and tries to find
	as much courage as he can. "Big" Bob looks up at the color
	rendering of his town with absolute horror. His eye scans the
	green trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink
	clouds on the horizon.

				BOB
			(bellowing)
		Did you do this?

				DAVID
			(quietly but clearly)
		Yes I did.

	Bob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.

				BOB
		Do you know that it's illegal?

				DAVID
			(thinks)
		Yes I do.

	Bob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing
	but just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his
	hair, shaking his head.

				BOB
		BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

				DAVID
		Because anybody should be able to
		paint in whatever color they want.

	ANGLE. BACK OF CROWD.

	Betty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the
	spectacle. There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of
	love. Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother ...

	SHOT. BOB.

				BOB
		You're not allowed to do this! I
		could arrest you for this.

				DAVID
		Still doesn't make it right.

	There is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes
	widen. His face goes flushed (darker gray). A vein bulges in
	his neck. He turns to the police chief.

				BOB
		Dan! Arrest them!

				DAN (POLICE CHIEF)
			(quietly)
		Um ... I don't know how to do that,
		Bob.

				BOB
		What do you mean!?

				DAN
		Well, I never had to do it before.

				BOB
		You put handcuffs on them and you
		take them to the police station.

				DAN
			(thinks)
		Oh. guess I could do that, then.

				DAVID
			(suddenly stronger)
		C'mere, Dan. I'll help you.

	David walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out.
	A louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually
	helps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join
	them and the murmur starts to grow ...

								CUT TO:

	NIGHT TIME.

	A bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	A group of "colored" kids hangs out on Main Street near the
	police station. They gaze off into the distance at the barred
	window of a jail cell. It is elevated half a story above the
	street. Everything is black and white except for the warm
	YELLOW LIGHT, that glows through the bars. They know in a
	glance who's inside.

	INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.

	David sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has
	never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the
	sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling.

	INT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ...

	Mr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He
	clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in
	true "inmate" fashion.

	REVERSE ANGLE. WALL.

	Rather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr.
	Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall
	complete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at
	his work and smiles.

	SHOT. POLICE CHIEF.

	He approaches David's cell from the other direction and
	knocks gently on the bars. David turns around.

				DAN
		There's someone to see you Bud.

	DAVID.

	David sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could
	be. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding
	crosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE
	LOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles.

				DAVID
		I thought it might be you.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE.

	He stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's
	outfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND
	WHITE.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Hope you're proud of yourself.

				DAVID
		I am actually ... Glad to see you've
		finally shown your true colors.

	Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the
	cell behind him.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Okay, let's cut the shit and get
		right to it. Where's that remote
		control?

				DAVID
		Why?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Because you're coming home.

				DAVID
			(smiles)
		Why don't you just take me back
		without it?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh. You're a smart little bastard
		aren't you?
			(tightly)
		It's kind of like a restricted
		ticket. You gotta leave the same
		way you came.

	David just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back
	on the bunk ...

				DAVID
		So ... I guess as long as I'm
		here, all sorts of things could
		happen to this place. We could
		have pink lawns and blue trees ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Just gimme the damn remote!

				DAVID
		I'm sorry. I can't do that.

	Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the
	barred window.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		I don't know what went wrong.
		You answered every question. You
		knew every detail. The senior
		Prom ... McIntire's Department
		Store. We had all the same warm
		memories: Sock hops. The Church
		Social ...

				DAVID
		They weren't my memories.
			(beat)
		I borrowed them. It's no good when
		you borrow them.

	Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to
	tremble.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(containing his rage)
		How long do you think you've been
		here?

				DAVID
			(warily)
		I don't know ... Three, four weeks.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Much less than that.
			(checks his watch)
		An hour and a half.

	David looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad
	nasty smile.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		See--and this is really great--
		the show was on for what--half an
		hour a week? So that means for
		every week that goes by in
		Pleasantville, only half an hour
		goes by in the real world.

	The smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Now Buddy, you're going on trial
		tomorrow. And if they find you
		guilty, you're gonna be stuck here
		forever. Well, not forever--lemme
		think ...
			(calculates)
		Five year sentence ... Carry the
		three ... That comes out to ...
		sixteen and a half centuries, and
		that's rounding down.

				DAVID
		I'm going on trial tomorrow?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		This is TV pal. They don't fool
		around.

	David is rocked but tries not to show it.

				DAVID
			(stoicly)
		There's worse places.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh sure. For the first hundred
		years. Then it starts to get a
		little monotonous.
			(beat)
		Sleep well.

	He taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him
	out. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down
	the hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David
	looks around his cell, truly afraid.

	CLOSER.

	He stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the
	ceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it
	... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David
	crosses to the small window and looks out.

	HIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.

	Across the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall
	complete with the newly painted mural. The "Utopian" view of
	Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable
	exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to
	BLACK AND WHITE.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

	It is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the
	front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history.
	There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.

	INT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

	The place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce
	meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews
	and ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous
	configuration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped
	across the back wall.

	ANGLE. BENCH.

	At the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is
	a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the
	front. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings
	finally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange
	combination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind." Big Bob
	bangs the gavel ...

	CLOSER.

	The undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the
	pews are Black and White. There is a "colored" section in the
	back for standing room only.

	ANGLE. JURORS BOX.

	George is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his
	relationship to one of the defendants. He is dressed
	impeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel.
	After a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of
	the room ...

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces.
	Betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr.
	Johnson. All at once, a hush goes through the crowd.

	ANGLE. DOORWAY.

	It swings open and David and Mr. Johnson are led in wearing
	handcuffs. Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to
	a table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob.
	There is no lawyer present. There is also no prosecutor.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He glances around a little confused. (Weird courtroom.) Big
	Bob bangs the gavel.

				BOB
		Bud Parker and William Johnson,
		you have been charged with
		desecration of a public building
		and the intentional use of
		prohibited paint colors in
		violation of the Pleasantville
		Code of Conduct and laws of
		common decency. Do you admit that
		on the night of May 1, you did
		consciously and willfully apply
		the following FORBIDDEN colors to
		the Pleasantville Town Hall:
			(beat)
		Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,
		Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox
		Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson,
		Yellow, Olive and Magenta.

				DAVID
		Um ... Yes I do. Where's our
		lawyer?

				BOB
		We prefer to keep these
		proceedings as "pleasant" as
		possible. I don't think a lawyer
		will be necessary.

	There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the
	black and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then
	proceeds.

				BOB (CONT)
		Do you further admit that this
		was done surreptitiously and
		under the cover of darkness?

				DAVID
		Well--it was dark out ...

				BOB
		Good. Do you further admit that
		this unnatural depiction occurred
		in full public view where it was
		accessible to, and in plain sight
		of, minor children?

				DAVID
		It was accessible to everyone.

				BOB
		Very well. Let the record show
		that the defendants have answered
		in the affirmative to all the
		charges.

	He looks directly at them for the first time.

				BOB (CONT)
		Do you have anything to say in
		your defense?

	SHOT. DEFENSE TABLE.

	Mr. Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified.

				MR. JOHNSON
		I didn`t mean to hurt anybody.
		I just have to paint ... I
		need to.

	He gropes for something else to say, but what else is there?
	David glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat.
	David rises from his chair.

				DAVID
		I think I've got something to say.

				BOB
		Very well ...

	David looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he
	looks back at Big Bob.

				DAVID
		I think I know why you're doing
		this. I mean, I understand why
		you're doing this. I used to
		feel the same way. I used to
		want this place to stay just the
		way it was. I never wanted it to
		change ...

	There is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(he smiles slightly)
		But nothing stays the same. You
		get things, and you lose things,
		and that's the good part and the
		bad part--but you can't have a
		good part without a bad part.

	He turns and sees his mother in the balcony. They lock eyes
	for a moment. David smiles slightly and continues.

				DAVID (CONT)
		It's like the basketball team.

				BOB
			(leaning forward)
		The basketball team?

				DAVID
		Sure. Everybody's upset because
		they're not winning anymore--but
		just think how it would feel if
		all of a sudden they do win.

	There's a murmur in the gallery.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Wouldn't it feel better than when
		they used to win all the time?

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob looks concerned.

				DAVID (CONT)
		See, I know you want it to stay
		"Pleasant" but there are so many
		things that are so much better:
		like Silly ... or Sexy ... or
		Dangerous ... or Wild ... or
		Brief ...
			(beat)
		And every one of those things is
		in you all the time if you just
		have the guts to look for them.
			(pointing to the "colored" section)
		Look at those faces back there.
		They're no different than you are.
		They just happened to see
		something inside themselves that
		you don't want to ...

				BOB
		Okay--that's enough!

				DAVID
		I thought I was allowed to
		defend myself.

				BOB
		You're not allowed to lie.

				DAVID
		I'm not lying ... Here I'll show
		you.

	He turns suddenly toward the jury box.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Mr. Simpson ...

				MR. SIMPSON
		Yes.

				DAVID
		What color is that hedge of yours?

				MR. SIMPSON
		Green.

				DAVID
		No, not that hedge. The other one.

				MR. SIMPSON
		The other one?

				DAVID
		The one in your mind. The one
		that you see on a bright cold
		morning. The one that you see
		when you walk in front of your
		house and you just stand there
		and stare.

	Mr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy
	look in his eye.

				DAVID (CONT)
		What color is that hedge?

	CLOSE UP. MR. SIMPSON.

	SUDDENLY AND BEFORE OUR EYES, MR. SIMPSON TURNS TO LIVING
	COLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob bangs
	the gavel.

				BOB
		I said, that's enough!

				VARIOUS VOICES FROM
				THE AUDIENCE
		"No ... Let him finish ... Go on ..."

	Big Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David
	suddenly turns toward George.

				DAVID
		Alright. Dad ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen
	while David confronts his "father." George straightens up.

				GEORGE
			(solemn)
		Yes Bud.

				DAVID
			(beat)
		Don't you miss her?

	CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

	He looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody
	listens. George just stares at him like he got shot.

				DAVID
		I mean, of course you do, but it
		isn't just the cooking or the
		cleaning that you miss--it's
		something else, isn't it ...

	George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as
	he glances toward the back of the room.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(softer whisper)
		Maybe you can't even describe it.
		Maybe you only know it when it's
		gone. Maybe it's like there's a
		whole piece of you that's missing
		too.
			(shrugs)
		You might even call it "love."

				BIG BOB
			(BANGING the gavel loudly)
		Okay, that's IT!!!

				DAVID
			(motioning toward the back)
		Now don't you think she looks just
		as pretty in color? Don't you
		think she looks just as pretty as
		she did the day you met her?

	Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls
	down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a
	long trail of COLOR behind it.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Don't you wish you could tell her
		that?

	He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him
	through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.

				BOB
			(POUNDING the gavel)
		YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!

				DAVID
		Why am I out of order?

				BOB
		BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO
		TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!

				DAVID
		Well I don't think it's a circus.
		And I don't think they do either.

	David motions behind him to the black and white section.
	There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.

				BOB
		THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.

				DAVID
		But see that's just the point. It
		can't stop at once. Because it's
		in you. And you can't stop
		something that's in you.

				BOB
			(tightly)
		It's not in ME.

				DAVID
		Oh sure it is.

				BOB
		No it isn't.

	He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans
	over the bench and gets right up in his face.

				DAVID
			(smug whisper)
		What do you want to do to me
		right now?

	Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves
	closer.

				DAVID (CONT)
		C'mon. Everyone's turning colors.
		Kids are making out in the street.
		No one's getting their dinner--
		hell, you could have a flood any
		minute ... Pretty soon you could
		have the women going off to work
		while the men stayed home and
		cooked ...

				BIG BOB
		That's not going to happen!

				DAVID
		But it could happen.

				BIG BOB
		No it couldn't!

	Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts
	around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of
	his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely
	RED IN THE FACE.

	WIDER.

	A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and
	just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big
	Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window.

	CLOSE UP. BIG BOB.

	He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down
	at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob
	freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and
	flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom.

	ANGLE. DOORWAY.

	As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town
	Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep
	green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators
	bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd
	moves outside.

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)

	All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars,
	Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally
	turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David
	walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his
	creation. The whole town is washed in joy.

	WIDER.

	Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet
	in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of
	conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like
	spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and
	looks at her brother making out.

				JENNIFER
		Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ...

	David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David
	throws his arms around his sister as more and more people
	stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She
	clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.

				DAVID
		Are you sure?

				JENNIFER
		I told you. I'm like positive.

				DAVID
		This thing works. We could go
		home right now.

				JENNIFER
		I'm not ready yet. I gotta do
		this for a little while.

	WIDER.

	They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge).

	A large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first
	time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning.
	Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit
	of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the
	distance.

				JENNIFER
		Besides. You think there's like
		a chance I'm gonna get into
		college back there?

				DAVID
			(thinks ...)
		Honestly ... no.

	They both smile.

				DAVID (CONT)
		You got the admissions letter.

				JENNIFER
		Right here.

				DAVID
		And you're sure about this?

				JENNIFER
		I've done the slut thing, David.
		It's really kinda old.

	David nods.

				DAVID
		I'll come back and check on you
		in a month.

	Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a
	couple of seconds.

				JENNIFER
		You're like the coolest brother
		in the world.

	David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly
	hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge
	Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at
	the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at
	her brother, then turns toward the door ...

	EXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY.

	She clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of
	oatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's
	clothing. Their faces are inches apart.

				MARGARET
		You're gonna forget about me.

				DAVID
		No I won't. I swear.

	Margaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her
	arms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft
	kiss. The umbrella falls to the ground ...

				MARGARET
			(a whisper)
		I like calling you David.

				DAVID
		I like it too.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	David stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at
	his side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr.
	Johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well how do you know it won't go
		back to the way it was?

				DAVID
		You're gonna keep painting aren't
		you?

	Mr. Johnson nods.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Well ...

	He nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other
	one last time.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(remembering something)
		Oh.
			(reaching into his pocket)
		I've got something for you.

	He pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it
	to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.

	INSERT. PAPER.

	It is a small painted replica of their mural in the same
	vibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like
	the one on the wall.

	SHOT. DAVID.

				DAVID
		It's beautiful.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Just a little--You know.

	David looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances
	toward the door.

	WIDER.

	Betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag. A sweater
	is draped over her arm.

				BETTY
			(extending the bag)
		I made you these for the trip.
		They're marshmallow rice squares.

				DAVID
		Thanks. I thought you weren't
		gonna ...

				BETTY
			(painful/
			quieter)
		I had to say goodbye.

	She looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him
	the bag.

				BETTY (CONT)
		There's a meatloaf sandwich in
		there too. Don't go skipping
		dinner just 'cause you're not
		here anymore.

				DAVID
		I won't.

				BETTY
			(voice quivering)
		And ... wear this on the trip in
		case it gets cold.

				DAVID
			(nodding)
		... It's a pretty short trip.

	She nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders
	anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then
	she throws her arms around his neck.

				BETTY
		I'm so proud of you, Bud.

				DAVID
		Thanks ... I love you.

				BETTY
		I love you too.

	She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty
	flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.

				BETTY (CONT)
		Well ...

	She steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the
	remote.

				DAVID
		You better stand back a little.

	Betty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room.
	David points the remote at the TV ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY.

	All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A
	WESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second
	or two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform
	synchronization.

	INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM.

	He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his
	new/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The
	black onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen
	TV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles.
	The place is inadvertantly in black and white.

	CLOSER.

	He reaches forward and turns on the TV (by hand) flipping
	around the dial. Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute ...
	Tony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial ...
	Court TV is doing an O.J. recap. David unfolds Mr. Johnson's
	sketch and glances down at it. He smiles to himself. A
	different kind of nostalgia ...

PLEASANTVILLE



                    A Fairytale by Gary Ross




     October 7, 1996




     "He was part of my dream of course 
     but then I was part of his dream too."

                      - Lewis Carroll "Through the looking glass"






	FADE IN:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. DAY.

	A college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high
	school seniors about their future.

				COLLEGE COUNSELOR
		... For those of you going on to college
		next year, the chance of finding a good
		job will actually decrease by the time
		you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop
		from thirty-one to twenty-six percent,
		and the median income for those jobs
		will go down as well ...

	There is some rustling in the audience.

				COLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT)
		Obviously, my friends, it's a
		competitive world and good grades are
		your only ticket through. By the year
		Two Thousand  ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS.

	A different teacher lectures a different class of students.

				HEALTH TEACHER
		... The chance of contracting HIV from a
		promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one
		in one hundred and fifty. The odds of
		dying in an auto accident are only one
		in twenty-five hundred.
			(beat)
		Now this marks a drastic increase ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS.

	Same angle. Different teacher.

				SCIENCE TEACHER
		... From just four years ago when ozone
		depletion was at ten percent of its
		current level. By the time you are
		twenty years old, average global
		temperature will have risen two and a
		half degrees. Even a shift of one
		degree can cause such catastrophic
		consequences as typhoons, floods,
		widespread drought and famine.

	REVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS.

	They stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID
	WAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth.
	Nobody moves ...

				SCIENCE TEACHER
			(chipper classroom tone)
		Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?

								CUT TO:

	1958.

	Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are
	neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet
	stillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in
	beautiful BLACK AND WHITE.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS)
		Honey, I'm home.

	SUBURBAN HOME.

	GEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the
	coatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer
	with a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that
	doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a
	tour guide at Disneyland.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)
		Hello darling.

	WIDER.

	MRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her
	apron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and
	concrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a
	fresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek.

				BETTY
		How was your day?

				GEORGE
		Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said
		that if things keep going the way they
		are, I might be seeing that promotion
		sooner than I thought.

				BETTY
		Oh darling that's wonderful!
			(an adoring gaze)
		I always knew you could do it.

	WAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	1996 -- (LIVING COLOR)

	DAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on
	a sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big
	smile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants,
	black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly
	... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never
	taking his eyes off the show.

				GEORGE (OS)
			(on T.V.)
		Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell?
			(sniffing)
		Is that your meat loaf?

				DAVID
			(by rote)
		"It might be ..."

				BETTY (OS)
			(shy smile)
		It might be.

	He leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek.

				GEORGE (OS)
		Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to
		this man's heart.

	There is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles
	wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when
	his real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)
		... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the
		deal

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand.
	Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix
	her age.

				DAVID'S MOM
		No--you have custody the first weekend
		of every month and this is the first
		weekend ...
			(pause)
		I don't care if yesterday was the
		thirtieth, this is still the first
		weekend.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the
	show.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)
		No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to
		go to La Costa ...
			(beat)
		Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's
		really my business, isn't it?

	He reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at
	an unnaturally high volume.

				GEORGE
			(on T.V.)
		Hey. Where are those kids?

				DAVID
			(reciting--a little louder)
		"Right behind you father."

				BUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER
			(on T.V.)
		Right behind you father.

	RESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE)

	The Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the
	foyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud
	has on a Letterman's sweater.

				MARYSUE
		Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little
		surprise for you.

				BETTY
		What's that Bud?

	Bud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue
	ribbon.

				BUD
		First prize at the science fair. There
		were lots of swell projects--guess mine
		was just the "swellest".

				BETTY
		Darling that's wonderful. Except there's
		no such word as "swellest".

				BUD
		Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the
		"English" fair.

	There is another jarring LAUGH TRACK.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He smiles right along with it. David stares transfixed at the
	set despite the continuing conversation in the other room.

				DAVID'S MOM (OS)
		Well sure they can stay by themselves,
		Barry, but that's not the point. You
		said you'd take them.
			(beat)
		Well fine--they'll stay by themselves
		then.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		What's a mother to do?

				BETTY(OS)
			(on T.V.)
		Oh--what's a mother to do?

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He grabs another handful of Doritos staring at the T.V ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. (SERIES OF SHOTS) DAY.

	A cacophony of modem life. Beepers and nose rings--blue hair
	and tattoos. Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another.
	The hormones are running crazy.

	SCHOOL COURTYARD.

	lt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime. Groups of kids
	hang out together, divided by their various cliques. The
	music pounds in the background.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link
	fence. Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks
	to someone in front of him.

				DAVID
		Hi. I mean ...
			(pause)
		... Hi.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him. It's a warm,
	welcoming smile.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID
		Look. You probably don't think I should
		be asking you this. I mean--not knowing
		you well and all ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She smiles wider at him, inviting him to continue.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID
			(pause ...)
		I mean I know you--everybody knows you
		... I just don't know you ...
		technically.

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She nods at him ...

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

				DAVID
		Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see
		you all the time in Algebra and I heard
		you humming that Van Halen song and I
		really like that song too ...
			(pause)
		Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing
		this weekend but my Mom's leaving town
		and she said I could use her car so ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

	She positively beams. The girl flicks her blonde hair and
	stares back at him adoringly.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	Instead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the
	ground.

	WIDE ANGLE. SCHOOLYARD.

	For the first time WE SEE THAT SHE WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.
	David stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard,
	rehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to
	face with a much cooler boy. He has a cell phone and a very
	hip haircut.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	David watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's
	waist and heads out of the playground ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. "LUNCHEON COURT". DAY.

	David and his friends are all gathered around the plastic
	picnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon
	court. The chess club meets at one end and there are some
	teachers at the other. All the cool kids are on the other
	side of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the
	same table every day.

				HOWARD
		Okay, whose window did Bud break when he
		was playing with his father's golf
		clubs?

				DAVID
		Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr.
		Jenkins have?

	Howard looks at him, puzzled.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name
		the cat they found in the gutter?

				HOWARD
		Scout?

				DAVID
		Marmalade.

	They all nod--and murmur with admiration.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Okay--here's one: Why did their parents
		come home early from their weekend at
		the lake?

	Everybody thinks.

	Nobody knows.

				DAVID (CONT)
		'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and
		they were worried about him.

	It's quiet for a beat.

				HOWARD
		You're unbelievable. You'll win this
		thing for sure. When is it on?

				DAVID
		Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's
		tomorrow at noon.

				HOWARD
			(weighing it)
		A thousand dollars ... And it's on all
		night?

				DAVID
		Of course it is Howard. That's why they
		call it a Marathon.

								CUT TO:

	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

	David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the
	parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same
	uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T
	shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car
	hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the
	prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all
	look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends
	are hanging out.

				KIMMY
		Omigod, it's so mortifying, being
		related to him. I can't believe you're
		like--

				JENNIFER
		Only on my parent's side.

				KIMMY
		I know, but you're like ... twins and
		stuff.
			(beat)
		You must be from like, the cool side of
		the uterus.

	A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They
	bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen
	year olds. The girls freeze when they see them.

				KIMMY (CONT)
		Omigod, omigod--here they come.

				CHRISTIN
		Don't do anything. Just don't like--do
		anything ...

				JENNIFER
			(cooly)
		Hi Mark.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously
	off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young
	racehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole
	parking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his
	lackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan
	Pathfinder like a small summit conference.

				MARK
			(to Jennifer)
		Hey.

				JENNIFER
			(right back)
		Hey.

	Beat ...

				MARK'S LACKEYS
			(to Jennifer's lackies)
		Hey.

				JENNIFER'S LACKEYS
			(back to them)
		Hey.

				MARK
		Saw you at the mall yesterday.

				JENNIFER
		Yeah ... Saw you too.

	Everyone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV
		tonight?

				MARK
		Yeah.
			(beat)

	Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement.

				JENNIFER
		My mom'll be out of town.

	Kimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys
	mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost
	on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.

				MARK
		So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...

				JENNIFER
			(smiling)
		Cool.

				MARK
			(nodding faster)
		Cool.

				VARIOUS LACKEYS
		Cool.

	Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods,
	summoning his flock.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK.

	lt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver." The
	uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There
	is a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have
	the same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of
	hell.

				JENNIFER (VO)
		... I know, I know--He's just like so
		FINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod."

	INT. WAGNER HOME.

	lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so
	at night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the
	cordless phone attached to her ear.

				JENNIFER
		It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like:
		"Well my Mom'll be out of town." And
		he's like "Well then, maybe we could--
		you know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure."
		And he's like "Well, cool."
			(beat)
		I know, he's just so smart.
			(pause ...)
		I don't know. Maybe that black thing I
		just got.
			(pause ...)
		It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute.
			(pause ... )
		Well, "hello?" He's not coming  over
		here to study ...
			(beat)
		I know. Well I'm jealous of you too
		sometimes.

	INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM.

	lt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful
	either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside
	with a cordless phone in his hand.

				DAVID
		... He's not homeless Howard, they just
		don't say where he lives.
			(pause ...)
		Well it's a silly question.
			(pause ...)
		Because nobody's homeless in
		Pleasantville.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her
	Mercedes.

				DAVID
		... because that's just not what it's
		like.

	She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway...

				DAVID (CONT)
		Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty.
		I gotta go.

	INT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM.

	The huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the
	room. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making
	a B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from
	the other direction, fiddling with her clothes.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	They hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at
	exactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at
	each other in shock.

				JENNIFER
			(stunned)
		What are you doing?

				DAVID
		What are you doing?

	Neither one moves. They clutch the remote together.

				JENNIFER
		David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna
		like be here in five minutes.

				DAVID
		Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon
		starts at six thirty.

				JENNIFER
		Pleasantville Marathon?

				DAVID
			(almost reverently)
		Yeah. Every episode ever.

				JENNIFER
			(getting hysterical)
		Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's
		gonna like beeeee here!

				DAVID
		Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.

				JENNIFER
		Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any
		STEREO!

	Jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks
	back and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of
	their hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes
	into a million tiny pieces.

				DAVID
			(breathless)
		Oh my God ...
			(sinking to his knees/
			scooping up the remains)
		Oh my God ...

				JENNIFER
		David, stop stressing, you can like--
		turn it on normally ...

				DAVID
		No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It
		doesn't work without a remote.

	David cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the
	DOORBELL RINGS behind him.

				JENNIFER
		Oh my God! He's here!

	Jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa
	and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David
	just stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer
	reaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair
	quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. FRONT DOOR.

	Jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't
	Mark Davis on the other side. DICK VAN DYKE STANDS ACROSS THE
	THRESHOLD IN A TV REPAIRMAN'S OUTFIT. Jennifer looks at him
	puzzled. He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin,
	toolbox in hand.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		TV repair.

				JENNIFER
			(beat)
		TV repair?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Yeah. TV busted?

				JENNIFER
			(pause ...)
		Yeah ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(smiling wider)
		Well here I am.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID'S POV.

	He glances out the front door toward a weird VAN parked at
	the curb. It says TV REPAIR on the side but looks like
	something from a medicine show. The antenna on top resembles
	a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy
	family from the 1950s, gathered around their TV set. Everyone
	wears a smile, including the dog. The hand-painted motto
	reads "Rob's TV Repair--WE'LL FIX YOU FOR GOOD."

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then
	crosses to the living room STEPPING NIMBLY AROUND THE
	OTTOMAN. He heads toward the TV.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(seeing the smashed remote)
		Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little
		disaster didn't ya fella.

				DAVID
		Yeah ... Sort of ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(setting down the toolbox)
		We'll get you fixed up in no time.

	He pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just
	stare. It's a strange looking box with the same happy family
	painted on the side. Dick Van Dyke pulls out another remote.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		I know how I'd feel if mine went out.
		Almost like losing a friend.

				DAVID
			(tentatively)
		You know, we didn't call any TV repair.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Well that makes it a lucky day for both
		of us, hunh?

	Jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living
	room.

				JENNIFER
		You think you could do this like soon?
		It's almost six thirty.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What's the rush?

				DAVID
			(cutting her off)
		The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six
		thirty.

	At that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a
	booming CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of
	the house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Pleasantville?

	David recoils slightly. Dick Van Dyke flashes him a smile.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for
		years.

				JENNIFER
		That's not the reason. I've got a date
		at six thirty.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(ignoring her/
			leaning closer to David)
		Hey--who did Muff in take to the
		masquerade ball when her date came down
		with the measles?

				DAVID
			(stunned)
		... Her father.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Right. And how did she dress him?

				DAVID
			(still staring)
		... Like Prince Charming.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(studying David/
			nodding)
		Nice ... Nice ...

				JENNIFER
		Um--hello? I've got like a social
		emergency here.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(ignoring her)
		Remember the one where Bud lost his
		cousin when he was s'posed to be
		watching him?

				DAVID
		Yeah ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What department store did they go to?

				DAVID
		McIntire's.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		McGinty's.

				DAVID
		No. McIntire's. Remember:
			(sings)
		"For the very best in men's attire,
		Head right down to McIntire's."

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(stunned)
		That's right.

	He stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles
	fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Say--why don't you take this remote
		instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph"
		in it.

				DAVID
		Ooomph?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you
		want something that'll put you right in
		the show.

				JENNIFER
			(quickly)
		We'll take it.

	CLOSER.

	He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking
	contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a
	strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash
	Gordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while
	Jennifer and David stare at him warily ...

				DAVID
			(beat)
		How much does it cost?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh--couldn't charge you for something
		like that. It's free.

				JENNIFER
		Free?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the
		least I could do.

	There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first.
	The house rattles for a moment then is quiet.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Well, I better get going. Your show's
		almost on, and ...
			(smiling at Jennifer)
		It's almost time for your date.

	He places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and
	smiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he
	suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and
	tumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a
	perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing
	position. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he
	looks back at them and smiles.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
			(grinning)
		Take care now.

	There is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the
	doorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the
	front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two
	before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his
	head.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	David glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the
	coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he
	reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he
	picks it up.

	CLOSER.

	David points the remote toward the TV set with an
	apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then
	pushes one of the buttons.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	The TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an
	angry housewife screams at a transvestite!

				DAVID
		Hunh.

	It ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time
	the channel changes.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(relaxing)
		Great.

	He continues to press the button, flipping through the
	channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches
	for the remote.

				JENNIFER
		Lemme see that.

				DAVID
		No way.

	He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on
	the Pleasantville Marathon.

	BUD'S VOICE fills the room.

				BUD (OS)
			(on TV)
		Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow
		your transistor radio?

				MARY SUE (OS)
			(on TV)
		I promised Betty Jane she could use it
		over the weekend.

	FULL SHOT. TV SET. "PLEASANTVILLE" (BLACK AND WHITE)

	Bud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor
	radio. They seem to be in the EXACT SAME POSITION as David
	and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control.

	ANGLE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

	She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction.

				JENNIFER
		Do you mind. This is like the most
		important moment of my whole life.

				DAVID
		Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for
		this.

				BUD (OS)
			(on TV)
		"But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a
		transistor in to electric shop."

				MARY SUE (OS)
			(on TV)
		"And I told Betty Jean she could have it
		for the picnic with Roy."

				JENNIFER
			(yanking at it)
		God, David. Just give it to me!

				DAVID
			(yanking it back)
		Get lost!

				JENNIFER
		YOU get lost!

	WIDER. LIVING ROOM.

	She tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands.
	David pulls in the opposite direction as they POINT IT
	DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TV.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT.

	A huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their
	own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a
	BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets
	sucked into the TV.

	WIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM.

	It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of
	the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY.

	David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's
	living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They
	still clutch the remote control in the exact same position
	that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and
	Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around
	the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE...

				DAVID
			(a whisper)
		Oh my God.

				JENNIFER
		What happened?

				DAVID
		I'm not sure.

	WIDER

	George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the
	landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit
	with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.

				GEORGE
			(as if to his own children)
		Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a
		move on, you're gonna be late for school.

	He continues to cross through the living room whistling into
	the kitchen ...

				JENNIFER
			(desperately)
		What did you do?

				DAVID
		I don't know.

				JENNIFER
			(examining her black and white skin)
		Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!

	He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in
	his hand. David frantically presses the buttons but nothing
	happens. All at once, there is a voice behind them.

				VOICE (OS)
		Psst! Over here.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	They whirl around to see DICK VAN DYKE'S FACE smiling at them
	from the TV set in the comer. It's an old '50s set with a big
	round picture tube. They run over to him as he smiles. His
	face is the only color in the room.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(beaming)
		Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you
		thought I was just a fan or something.

				JENNIFER
		What happened?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		A miracle.

	They stare stunned at the TV set.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		... See, every time I thought I'd found
		someone they'd turn out to disappoint me.
		They'd know the early episodes, but they
		wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd
		know all about Muffin but they wouldn't
		know about Bud ...

				DAVID
			(to the TV set)
		What the hell's going on!

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're
		in ...
			(smiles)
		You know ...

	David glances around at his black and white surroundings. His
	"mother's" voice rings out from the kitchen.

				BETTY (OS)
		Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the
		table.

				DAVID
		We're in Pleasantville?

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(grinning)
		Dream come true, hunh?

				JENNIFER
			(panicking)
		This isn't funny! I happen to have a
		very important date in like five minutes!

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Well, you don't have to worry about that
		anymore.

	FULL SHOT. TELEVISION SET. (COLOR)

	All at once the scene on the TV changes and Dick Van Dyke's
	picture gives way to a WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the WAGNER HOUSE.
	Mark Davis is standing at the front door, BANGING on the
	brass knocker. He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a
	moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk
	never looking back.

				MARK DAVIS
			(under his breath)
		... Bitch.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (BLACK AND WHITE AGAIN)

	Jennifer flings herself at the screen, as Dick Van Dyke
	appears all over again.

				JENNIFER
		Noooooo!

				DAVID
		You--you gotta get us out of here.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(recoiling slightly)
		Why would I do that?

				DAVID
		Because we don't belong!

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's
		Department store" ... "Their father
		dressed as Prince Charming." That was
		gorgeous Bud.

				DAVID
		My name's David.

				JENNIFER
			(wailing on the floor)
		Oh GOD ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(a little snippy)
		You know--this is a pretty strange way
		of showing your appreciation.

				DAVID
		Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We
		just--we want to go home now.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(hurt)
		But you don't know how long I've been
		looking for someone like you.

	A long face slowly descends on him.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		I'm very disappointed ...
			(deep breath)
		In fact ... I'm starting to get a little
		upset.

	David moves toward the screen.

				DAVID
		Don't get upset.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(snapping back)
		Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone
		for years ... You pour your heart into
		it ... This is a privilege you know.
			(shakes his head)
		I don't think I better talk about this
		right now.

				DAVID
		Where are you going ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		I don't think we should discuss this
		until I'm a little bit more composed.

				DAVID
		WAIT A MINUTE!!

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(turning his back)
		Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so
		emotional ...

				DAVID
		COME BACK!!!

	Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as
	the screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as
	Jennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and
	starts rapidly pushing buttons.

	Nothing happens.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(dropping the gizmo)
		Oh God.

				JENNIFER
		What's going to happen?

				DAVID
		I don't know ... It's not possible ...
			(looking at her)
		Is it possible?

				BETTY (OS)
		Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is
		getting cold.

				DAVID
		It can't be possible.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	Betty (their "mother") sticks her head into the living room
	wearing her black and white apron. She has a great big
	Pepsodent smile.

				BETTY
		Well, come on kids. You're not going off
		to school without a hot breakfast inside
		you ...

	They just stare at her.

				BETTY (CONT)
		Forward march.

	They exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to
	their feet. Jennifer waits for David who forces a smile then
	starts toward the kitchen.

				BETTY (CONT)
		I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue.
		It's so flattering.

				JENNIFER
			(dazed)
		Thanks.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they
	suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them:

	THEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN.

	Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table.
	There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs.
	Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham.
	The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George
	Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.

				GEORGE
			(once again)
		Morning kids. Better get a move on or
		you're going to be late for school.

	They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright
	sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle
	symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare
	straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the
	heap.

				DAVID
			(under his breath)
		I don't believe this.

				JENNIFER
		Neither do I.

				GEORGE
		Well, c'mon. Dig in.

	David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two
	heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves.

				BETTY
			(to Jennifer)
		I put blueberries in them just the way
		you like.

				JENNIFER
		Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.

				BETTY
			(big smile)
		Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to
		start your day with a nice big breakfast.

	She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the
	chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(oppressively chipper)
		Here. Why don't you have some waffle
		cakes.
			(beat)
		And there's sausage and eggs and some
		good crisp bacon ...
			(beat)
		... And a ham steak.

	Betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge
	slab of butter.

				BETTY (CONT)
		... And of course, a nice big bowl of
		oatmeal.

	Jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who
	looks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks
	stunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a
	forkful of the oozing mess ...

								CUT TO:

	FULL SHOT. PAT BOONE.

	He stands facing the CAMERA in an actual Kinescope from 1958.
	The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the
	background singers are all white debutantes. He wears a
	letterman's sweater and button down shirt ...

				PAT BOONE
		"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity
		... Oh rooty."

	He CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's
	nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). It becomes a slow and
	lilting melody ...

				PAT BOONE (CONT)
		"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE.

	The MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image
	of this strange "Utopia." The effect is a weird, sanitizied
	version of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video.
	There are men tipping their hats and women walking their
	dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen.

				PAT BOONE (VO)
			(slowly ...)
		"... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom."

	Pruned hedges. Twin beds. BIG houses. The CAMERA CRANES DOWN
	in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David
	and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs.

				JENNIFER
		I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.

				DAVID
		Just take deep breaths.

				JENNIFER
		All that animal fat. I feel it in my
		pores or something.

	Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from
	side to side--totally absorbed.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		I still don't see why we're doing this.

				DAVID
		We're supposed to be in school.

				JENNIFER
		We're supposed to be at home David! We're
		supposed to be in color!
			(wailing)
		Oh God ...

	A man calls out from across the street.

				MR. SIMPSON
		Hello Bud.

				DAVID
		Hello Mr. Simpson.

				MR. SIMPSON
		Hear your Dad got a new car.

				DAVID
		Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

				JENNIFER
		You know him?

				DAVID
		Owns the hardware store.

				JENNIFER
		Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know
		what's going on but you'd better fix it!
		I had a date with Mark Davis and I even
		bought new UNDERWEAR!

				DAVID
		We just gotta play along for a little
		while ... till that guy shows up again.
		Then I'll talk to him and ...

				JENNIFER
		Play along?

				DAVID
		Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and
		you're ... um--Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
			(ripping the barette from her hair)
		No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't
		dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell
		not going to do it for you!

				DAVID
		We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck
		until he comes back.

				JENNIFER
		Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?

				DAVID
		To who?

	Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror
	starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming
	SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the
	block.

	WIDER.

	Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come
	flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN)

	They work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of
	the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing
	across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response"
	anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a
	tree.

				FIREMAN
		C'mere, kitty ...

	He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the
	tree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by
	them, petting it gently as he goes.

				JENNIFER
		Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like
		"Nerdville".
			(shakes her head)
		I always knew you'd pay a price for
		this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly
		geekridden for this long without
		suffering some like, really tragic
		consequences.
			(voice wavering)
		... But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm
		starting to get really--popular. Debbi
		Russell transferred to another school
		and my skin's been great since March and
		Mark Davis is starting to come around
		and ...

				BOY'S VOICE (OS)
		Hello Mary Sue.

	Jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old
	driving by in his convertible. He is extremely handsome with
	Jack Armstrong features and a Letterman's sweater. Despite
	her crisis, Jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl.
	Biff Martin flashes a huge Pepsodent smile. The guy is a
	"dreamboat".

				BIFF (CONT)
		What's all the commotion? Where's the
		cat?

				JENNIFER
		Um ... It's ...

	Biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the
	kitty in his arms.

				BIFF
		Ah, right ...
			(smiling at her again)
		Well--guess I'll see ya later Mary Sue.

	He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his
	really keen convertible. Jennifer gapes as he disappears
	around the corner.

				JENNIFER
		Who's that?

				DAVID
		Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball
		team.

				JENNIFER
			(still gaping)
		Does he--you know--like "me"?

				DAVID
		As a matter of fact he does.

				JENNIFER
			(flicking her hair)
		Hunh.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.

	Streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double
	doors. All cheery and very pleasant looking. It looks like a
	Leni Riefenstahl movie.

	ANGLE. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

	David stands beside Jennifer looking at the entrance to the
	school. Three girls huddle together by the front steps.

				JENNIFER
		Those are my friends.

				DAVID
		Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.

				JENNIFER
			(staring at them)
		Can we do any better?

				DAVID
		I don't think so.

				LISA ANNE
			(seeing her)
		Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for
		Geography.

				JENNIFER
		Okay ...

	She flicks her hair back--cops a first day of school
	attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the
	place.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER ...

	It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower
	Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve
	button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned
	to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the
	blackboard.

	ANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER.

	Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in
	her hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of
	the blackboard.

				MISS PETERS
		Last week Class, we discussed the
		geography of Main Street. This week,
		we're going to be talking about Elm
		Street. Can anyone tell me one of the
		differences between Elm Street and Main
		Street?
			(pointing)
		Tommy.

				TOMMY
		It's not as long?

	Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.

				MISS PETERS
		That's right, Tommy. It's not as long.
		Also, it only has houses. So the
		geography of Main Street is different
		than the geography of Elm Street.

	ANGLE. JENNIFER.

	She glances around at several students who seem to be nodding
	in agreement. All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air.

				MISS PETERS
		Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
		What's outside of Pleasantville?

	The teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her
	face. She looks vaguely troubled.

				MISS PETERS
		What?
			(beat)
		I don't understand ...

				JENNIFER
		Outside of Pleasantville ... What's at
		the end of Main Street?

	The class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say "Oh. We get
	it now. Boy what a stupid question." Miss Peters gives a kind
	but condescending look.

				MISS PETERS
		Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer
		to that. The end of Main Street is just
		the beginning again.

	Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and
	down. Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY.

	There are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym.
	Each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks
	with a "PLEASANTVILLE" jersey.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his
	hand. (Not exactly an athletic image.) David lets go of a
	jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. He looks
	a little surprised.

				DAVID
		Wow.

	He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David
	retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it
	up blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING
	NOTHING BUT NET.

	FULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM.

	Ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the
	hoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN
	NICKING THE RIM. The boys retrieve their shots as the coach
	claps his hands.

				COACH
		That's it men. Keep it up. Big game
		tomorrow.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely.
	David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces
	off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as
	smoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.

				BIFF (OS)
		Bud ...

	WIDER.

	Biff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the
	other side of the Gym. He is a classic All American Hero--
	somewhere between 4-H club member and a future astronaut.

				BIFF
			(a little nervous)
		Hi ya Bud.

				BUD
		Hi ya Biff.

	He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down.

				BIFF
		Can I ask you a question?

				BUD
		Sure.

				BIFF
		Well ... If I was to ask your sister ...
		What I mean is, if I was to go up to
		Mary Sue ...

				DAVID
		Oh God! Are we in that episode?

				BIFF
		What?

				DAVID
		I don't believe it.

				BIFF
		What's the matter?

				DAVID
		You want to ask her out tonight, right?
		And then you want to give her your
		school pin ...

				BIFF
		Yeah ... How'd you know?

				DAVID
			(shaking his head)
		Lucky guess.
			(beat)
		Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real
		good time for that right now ...

	Biff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David.

				DAVID (CONT)
		What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a
		little "different" lately ...

				BIFF
			(stunned)
		She won't go out with me?

				DAVID
		I didn't say that. It's just that right
		now ...

				BIFF
		I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't
		go out with me ...

	All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and
	hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of
	revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.

	WIDE ANGLE. GYM.

	Play comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE,
	DUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff.
	David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other
	side of the gym.

				DAVID
			(under his breath)
		Look, I'm sure we'll work something out.
		I'll talk to her or something.

	Biff looks at him, troubled.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Honest. It'll be fine.

	Biff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back.

								CUT TO:

	INT. CORRIDOR. LATER ...

	David stands off to the side with his sister, while class
	pours out around them.

				JENNIFER
		No way.

				DAVID
		One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If
		you don't go out with this guy we could
		throw their whole universe out of whack.

				JENNIFER
		It's too weird David. This place is
		giving me the creeps. Did you know all
		the books are blank?

				DAVID
		What?

				JENNIFER
		I looked in the library. They got covers
		with nothing inside them.

				DAVID
		What were you doing in a library?

				JENNIFER
		I got lost.
			(beat)
		Oh here ... look at this!

	She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches.
	Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire.

				DAVID
		JENNIFER!

				JENNIFER
		Just watch. You know why those guys just
		get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing
		burns around here, that's why! They
		don't need any firemen ...

	Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.

				DAVID
		Jen, listen ...

				JENNIFER
			(trembling)
		I like--really need a cigarette, too.

				DAVID
			(putting his arm around her)
		I'll get us out of here. I really will.
		But if we don't play along we could
		alter their whole existence. We may
		never get home.

	She looks over at him, slowly.

				JENNIFER
		You really think anybody's gonna, like,
		notice if I don't have a chocolate malt
		with this guy.

	At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering
	around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of
	wind-up toys.

				PEGGY JANE
			(high-pitched--rapid fire)
		You won't believe what we just heard.

				LISA ANNE
		Biff Martin's going to ask you out.

				BETTY JEAN
		And that's not all ...

				PEGGY JANE
		No, that's not all ...

				ALL THREE TOGETHER
		He's going to give you his pin!

	They explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer
	looks over at David.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. DUSK.

	A lone streetlamp glows in the foreground. Jennifer's voice
	plays OS.

				JENNIFER
		You sure I'm supposed to wear this?

	INT. MARY SUE'S ROOM.

	Jennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a
	poodle skirt. Under the sweater she wears a 1950's "bullet
	bra" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons.

				JENNIFER
			(looking in the mirror)
		I could like kill a guy with these
		things.

				DAVID
		It's in your closet.

				JENNIFER
			(examining her profile)
		I've worn some kinky stuff before ...

				DAVID
		He won't notice anyway.

				JENNIFER
		What do you mean?

				DAVID
		They don't notice that kind of thing.

				JENNIFER
		So what's the point?

				DAVID
		Jen please ...

				JENNIFER
		He-llo? I've got like three pounds of
		underwire here ...

				DAVID
		Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late
		for work.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. SODA SHOP. DUSK.

	The flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink.
	Underneath it, the swirling script spells "SODA SHOP". Johnny
	Mathis drifts out into the evening air ...

	CLOSER.

	David comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get
	his breath. He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges
	inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	Mr. Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the
	counter. He is a "pleasant" looking man, in his early forties
	wearing a white apron and black glasses. The strains of
	"MISTY" get louder as Bud lets the screen door slam behind
	him.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(looking up)
		Bud?

				DAVID
		Sorry ... I had to help my folks and
		then I couldn't find my hat ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh.

	He stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		I didn't know what to do.

	He stares at the rag a little troubled.

				DAVID
		What's wrong?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well--I always wipe down the counter and
		then you set out the napkins and glasses
		and then I make the french fries ...

				DAVID
			(confused)
		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.

	He looks down at the towel clearly disturbed. David pauses
	for a moment then starts toward him.

				DAVID
		I'm sorry.

	He crosses to Mr. Johnson who has polished one section of the
	counter right down to the wood. David takes the towel out of
	his hand and folds it neatly in front of him.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(gently)
		You know, if this ever happens again,
		you can make the fries even if I haven't
		put out the napkins yet.

				MR. JOHNSON
		I'm so glad you're here.

				DAVID
		I understand.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	Biff's convertible rolls up to the curb with Pat Boone
	playing on the radio. He runs a comb through his short blonde
	hair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and
	heading up the walk. Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment
	later, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway ...

				BIFF
		Oh. Mary Sue ...

	EXT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	The place is really hopping now. All the spots in the parking
	lot are filled with vintage "jalopies" and several patrons
	are streaming through the door. The SAME JOHNNY MATHIS SONG
	is still PLAYING on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda
	sign blinks against the sky.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	David is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to
	keep up with the load. Several clean cut teenagers pepper him
	with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. It's
	clear he isn't used to this.

				DAVID
			(frazzled)
		Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two
		orders of fries and a split?

				TEEN AGE GIRL
		Peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes,
		order of fries, and we'll split it.

	David nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow. He
	scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as Mr. Johnson
	comes up beside him.

				MR. JOHNSON
		There aren't any cheeseburgers.

				DAVID
			(turning)
		What?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well, usually I put out the burger and
		then you finish with the lettuce ...

				DAVID
		Listen to me!

	Mr. Johnson recoils slightly.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Do you have the lettuce?

				MR. JOHNSON
		... Yeah.

				DAVID
		Have you cooked the burgers?

				MR. JOHNSON
			(quieter)
		Yes.

				DAVID
		Well you can just put on the lettuce,
		finish the burger and pretend it was me
		doing it all along.

	Mr. Johnson stares at him.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Really. It's fine.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE.

	The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a
	Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays
	through, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her
	"girlfriends" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a
	table, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing
	against him as she goes.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and
	apprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda
	spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all
	over his chest.

	FULL SHOT. TABLE.

	Biff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome
	devotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross
	between Troy Donahue and a mannequin.

				BIFF
			(haltingly)
		I sure am glad you said you'd come out
		with me tonight Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
			(full blown "Mary Sue")
		Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad
		you asked me.

	He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.

				BIFF
		I don't know if I ever said this to you
		before, but, well ... I think you're
		just about the keenest girl in the whole
		school ...

				JENNIFER
		Really Biff? The keenest?

				BIFF
		Oh yeah.

				JENNIFER
			(all sarcasm)
		Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

				DAVID (OS)
		What can I get you two?

	WIDER.

	He stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper
	and a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost
	bursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty
	angle with large white apron tied around his neck.

				BIFF
		Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my
		usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

	More goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the
	same dopey countenance.

				JENNIFER
		Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a
		salad and an Evian Water.

	He shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		Cheeseburger it is.

	ANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David
	posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an
	eye on the table the entire time ...

	RESUME. TABLE.

	Biff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look
	on his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him.
	She's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue."

				BIFF
		See the whole time we were in civics
		together, I really wanted to sit next to
		you--but you were always sitting between
		Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne.

	There is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond.

				BIFF (CONT)
		... And you always seemed so smart and
		everything. Like that report you did on
		"Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know
		what I'd talk to you about.

				JENNIFER
		Well, sometimes talking's over-rated.
		Don't you think?

				BIFF
		Hunh?
			(goony laugh)
		Oh, right ...

	He still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two
	then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary
	break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all
	over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.

				BIFF (CONT)
		So I know I haven't been steady with
		anybody, but I just don't want to rush
		it. You don't want to make a mistake
		with something that important.

				JENNIFER
		Oh, gosh no.

				BIFF
		I mean, there's kids that are even
		holding hands already but I figure
		there's plenty of time for that kind of
		thing later on. Don't you?

				JENNIFER
		Oh you bet.
			(beat)
		Will you excuse me for a sec?

	Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister
	practically stumbles through the bathroom door.

	INT. BATHROOM.

	Of course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way
	to the sink and leans against the counter.

				JENNIFER
		Jesus Chirist ...

	She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a
	dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a
	moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.

				GIRL'S VOICES
			(overlapping)
		"Did he give it to you ... Did he give
		it to you ... I bet he gave it to her
		... Did he give it to you?"

				JENNIFER
			(straight ahead)
		I don't think he knows how.

	They TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It
	sounds like an aviary.

				LISA ANNE
		I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's
		Lane.

				PEGGY JANE
		I bet he is. I bet he is.

				BETTY JEAN
		I bet he's even gonna hold her hand!

	They TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	David is standing beside their table as she retums from the
	bathroom.

				DAVID
			(chipper)
		Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry
		cokes.
			(pointedly)
		If you need anything, I'll be right over
		there.

				JENNIFER
			(Mary Sue)
		Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly
		need when we have each other?

	She flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and TOUCHES
	BIFF'S HAND. Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her
	brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye." David
	just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the
	Soda fountain.

				BIFF
			(befuddled)
		Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over
		and sit next to you in civics but ...

				JENNIFER
		You want to get out of here?

				BIFF
		What?

				JENNIFER
		You wanna get out of here? You wanna
		leave?

				BIFF
			(confused)
		But where would we go?

				JENNIFER
			(shrugging)
		... Lover's Lane.

				BIFF
			(swallow)
		Lover's Lane!

	There is an audible GASP from the booth behind them. Jennifer
	ignores it.

				JENNIFER
		Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	He just stares at her with his mouth open ...

	WIDER.

	Jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand.

				JENNIFER
		C'mon. Let's go.

	FULL SHOT. SODA FOUNTAIN.

	David is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he
	sees Jennifer leading Biff by the hand into the parking lot.
	Everyone at the counter is enjoying their dessert, when David
	lets out a blood curdling scream.

				DAVID
		NOOOOOO!

	He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door.
	Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance ...

	EXT. SODA SHOP.

	Biff's car is just pulling onto the street when David sprints
	into the parking lot. He takes off after the car, sprinting
	down the street.

				DAVID
		YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T
		EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO
		DOESN'T EXIST!

	The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a
	jog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the
	street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on
	his face.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(to God)
		Thanks a lot.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is a beautiful tree-lined pond with a lush willow tree in
	the foreground. The moonlight glistens silver across the
	water. Several cars are parked in a row with their occupants
	HOLDING HANDS. Biff's convertible is parked at the end.

	SHOT. BIFF'S CAR.

	He sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead. Jennifer
	is draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the
	most of her mohair sweater. She stares at Biff in a not-so-
	Pleasantville-kind-of-way. He glances over at her and
	swallows.

				BIFF
		Sure is pretty.

				JENNIFER
			(staring at him)
		Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.

				BIFF
		To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think
		you'd want to come here until we'd been
		pinned for a little while.

				JENNIFER
		Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you
		want to.

	She leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top
	of the seat. Her tits point toward the sky.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
			(breathy)
		Or maybe I should just "pin" you.

	He looks over at her a little confused, then breaks into his
	goony laugh.

				BIFF
		Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you
		possibly pin me?

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	He is still guffawing when he looks over at Jennifer and
	suddenly freezes. Biff's eyes widen ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	David comes sprinting up to the porch, then doubles over
	catching his breath. He clings onto the porch swing when the
	door opens behind him.

				BETTY
		Bud?

	WIDER.

	His "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch. David
	catches his breath then forces a smile.

				GEORGE
		Son, what's wrong?

				DAVID
		Have you seen Mary Sue?

				BETTY
		Why no. She's still on her date with
		Biff ... is something the matter?

				DAVID
			(still panting a little)
		No, I ... I was just ... worried about
		her.

	His mother and father exchange a "knowing" look. George rests
	a hand on his shoulder.

				GEORGE
			(oppressively paternal)
		Bud, your sister's a little older now
		and she's naturally going to start going
		out with boys.
			(beat)
		... In fact pretty soon--she's even
		going to get married and make someone a
		good little home-maker like your mother
		here.
			(smiles at Betty/
			inside joke)
		That's IF she can learn to bake.

				BETTY
		Oh, George ...

				GEORGE
		But your sister is a fine young woman
		and she would never do anything for us
		to be concerned about.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	The low gutteral MOANS of two coupling animals drifts out
	over the evening air. It is raw and primitive and desperate.
	The CAMERA begins to TRACK behind all the other cars--their
	occupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette. It
	finally COMES TO REST on a convertible at the end, with a
	girl's leg sticking out the window.

	CLOSER.

	A Letterman's sweater hangs over the door. The windshield is
	completely fogged. Jennifer's sweater is draped over the
	backseat. The car is rocking.

	INT. CAR.

	They are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff
	pulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered
	with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's
	stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings
	desperately to the steering wheel.

				BIFF
			(some terror)
		I think I better go home now Mary Sue ...

	She holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard.

				JENNIFER
			(breathless)
		... Why?

				BIFF
			(more terror)
		I think ... I might be ill ...

	He glances down at his lap a little confused.

				BIFF (CONT)
			(a whisper)
		I think something's happening to me.

	He looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up
	and grabs a handful of his hair.

				JENNIFER
		It's s'posed to happen, Biff.

				BIFF
		It is?

				JENNIFER
		Trust me ...

	He looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down,
	and OUT OF FRAME ...

								CUT TO:
	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	A single light is burning in the kitchen window.

				BETTY (OS)
		Do you want some more cookies?

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his
	face. There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs
	all over the table.

				DAVID
			(sick)
		Oh no ... I'm fine.

				BETTY
		How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?

				DAVID
		I'm fine.

	There is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up.

				BETTY
		Now who could that be.

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents." David
	swings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the
	porch.

				DAVID
		Oh hi!

				MR. JOHNSON
		Hi there. You took off so quick. I
		wasn't sure if you were okay.

				DAVID
		Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ...
		Had to get home early.

	Mr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone
	of voice.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Bud ...

				DAVID
		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(sotto)
		You know how when we close up, I close
		the register, then you lower the shades,
		then I turn out the lights, then we both
		lock the doors.

				DAVID
		Yeah ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(proud)
		Well you weren't around this time so I
		did the whole thing myself.

	CLOSER.

	Mr. Johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face.
	His shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little.
	There is a sudden sparkle in his eye.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(more confidential)
		Not only that, I didn't even do it in
		the same order. First I lowered the
		shades, then I closed the register.

	He looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance
	behind him.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Oh, hello Betty.

				BETTY
		Hello Bill.

	Neither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks
	on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and
	his new found virility.

				DAVID
			(quickly)
		Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ...
		really appreciate it.

	He turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's
	convertible pulls up at the curb.

	INT. CAR. CLOSE UP. JENNIFER.

	She looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car (OUT
	OF FRAME).

				JENNIFER
		Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really
		wonderful time.

	ANGLE. BIFF. OTHER SIDE OF CAR.

	He sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his
	face. Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit
	with a couple of thousand volts.

				BIFF
		... Me too.

	She leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites
	his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff
	smiles back.

	EXT. CAR.

	She climbs out and shuts the door. Jennifer nods to Mr.
	Johnson as she heads up the walk.

				JENNIFER
			(sweetly)
		Hello Mr. Johnson.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh, hello Mary Sue.

	She is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch.
	David grabs her arm.

				DAVID
			(urgent whisper)
		What did you do to him?

				JENNIFER
			(innocently)
		Nothing.

	She starts up the staircase. David follows her and the CAMERA
	follows them both.

				DAVID
		What do you mean "nothing?" That's not
		nothing. That's ...

	She reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him.

				JENNIFER
		Relax "Bud." We had a really nice time.
			(mock YAWN)
		... Now I'm really tired and we gotta
		get up early for school in the morning
		so ...

	She flashes her brother an evil grin.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		'Night.

	She shuts the door softly in his face. David stairs at the
	gray wood in front of him.

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	Biff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in
	his eye. The car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or
	two, before he glances over to his right.

	CLOSE UP. BIFF.

	The stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement:

	BIFF'S POV. ROSE.

	There, against a gray picket fence, on a black and white
	street in a black and white neighborhood, A SINGLE RED ROSE
	IS BLOOMING.

								CUT TO:

	AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. MORNING

	It would be a stunning vista if it wasn't in black and white.
	The church steeple gleams in the sunlight. The perfect little
	houses look like a row of pretty toys ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. DAY.

	David sits parked in front of the TV furtively turning
	through the channels. He flips the dial frantically. No sign
	of Dick Van Dyke.

				BETTY (OS)
		Bud. It's 7:30 in the morning. Are you
		watching television?

	He gives her a sheepish grin and sighs ...

								CUT TO:
	INT. SCHOOL GYM. DAY.

	It is the same configuration as earlier. Everyone wears their
	Pleasantville "Lions" jerseys, white sneakers and black
	socks. David enters the Gym a little groggy. He hasn't had
	much sleep.

	CLOSER.

	He looks up and stops. David cocks his head to the side,
	staring across the gym.

	HIS POV. BIFF AND OTHER BOYS.

	They are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball
	under his arm. Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly
	describing something that is holding their RAPT ATTENTION.

	WIDER ANGLE. INCLUDING DAVID.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		Oh no ...

	Biff continues his story while they stare at him with their
	mouths open. The Coach blows his whistle.

				COACH
		Come on men. Let's go. Big game next
		week.

	The huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander
	toward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES
	EVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge
	of the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym.
	Everyone stares in disbelief.

				DAVID
		Oh my God ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. DAY.

	David stands face to face with his sister in mid
	conversation.

				DAVID
		You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED
		you.

				JENNIFER
		So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay.
		They're like not good at basketball
		anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.

				DAVID
		You don't understand. You're messing
		with their UNIVERSE.

				JENNIFER
		Well maybe it needs to be messed with.
		Did that ever like--occur to you?
			(beat)
		You know, they don't want to be like
		this, it's just that nobody ever helped
		them before.

				PEGGY JANE
			(walking past)
		"MS". How you doin'?

				JENNIFER
		Kewl "PJ". How you doin'?

				PEGGY JANE
			(relishing her new word)
		"Kewl."

	Jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by.

				DAVID
		You have no right to do this.

				JENNIFER
		Well if I don't who will?

				DAVID
		They're happy like this.

				JENNIFER
		David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt
		and a sweater set.
			(pause ...)
		You like all this don't you?

	David recoils slightly.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		I mean, you don't think it's just like
		dorky or funny or something ... you
		really like it.
			(shudders)
		Oh God! I am just so personally
		horrified right now ...

				DAVID
		I just don't think we have the right
		to ...

				JENNIFER
		David, let me tell you something. These
		people don't want to be geeks. They want
		to be "attractive." They've got a lot of
		potential, they just don't know any
		better.

				DAVID
		They don't have that kind of potential.

				JENNIFER
		Um--hello? You want to like take a look?

	Jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked
	in an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and
	the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is
	sexually charged. They speak to one another in a close
	whisper--their faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets
	shy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum,
	but the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME.

				BOY
		Wow. What kind of gum is that?

	CLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

	He looks over in shock as she sucks the BRIGHTLY COLORED
	BUBBLE GUM back into her mouth. Jennifer flicks her hair.

				JENNIFER
		I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the
		flagpole.

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS
	LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF
	THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang
	out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's
	Lane as the pond glistens in the distance ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.

	It is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman
	Rockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter
	and a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's
	best friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother
	sits at her side.

				DR. HENDERSON
		Let me see it again.

	Lisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE.
	Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her
	tongue literally gleams with color.

				DR. HENDERSON (CONT)
			(examining it)
		Well ... I don't think it's anything to
		worry about ... It'll probably just
		clear up by itself.
			(to Lisa Anne)
		Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate.
		No french fries, that kind of thing.
			(aside/
			to the Mother)
		It's just a "teenage" thing.


	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	It is really rocking now. More cars are lined up along the
	edge of the lake as the REAL (AND NASTY) VERSION OF TOOTY
	FRUITY (BY LITTLE RICHARD) PLAYS OS:

				LIL RICHARD (VO)
		"... Got a gal--her name is Sue. She
		knows just what to do ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. (MONTAGE)

	PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	TOOTY FRUITY CONTINUES AS DAVID FLIPS FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE
	CHANNELS LOOKING FOR DICK VAN DYKE. THERE IS ONLY A PEPSODENT
	COMMERCIAL. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD ...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM (MUSIC CONT ...)

	The Pleasantville Lions lose a game late in the second half.
	The scoreboard reads 84 to 16 ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

	David examines the back of the TV set ...

	INT. FURNITURE STORE. (MUSIC CONT...)

	A large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at
	an item on the display floor, like it is the monolith in
	"2001". They seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as
	the CAMERA PUSHES IN TO REVEAL: a double bed ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

	David sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a
	Brillcream commercial plays in front of him ...

				LIL RICHARD (OS)
		"... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam
		boom!"

	SODA SHOP. NIGHT. ON DAVID.

	He heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but
	he's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT
	RED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He
	shakes his head.

	SODA SHOP.

	The place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a
	couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The
	letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The
	Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and
	Roll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air.
	Somebody has played the flip side.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young
	couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and
	hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are
	FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return
	to normal. David shakes his head.

	FOLLOWING HIM.

	He crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad
	of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND
	THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE
	STOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his
	sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder.

				DAVID
		What'll it be?

				BIFF
			(still chipper as ever)
		Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the
		usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

	Bud has already written it down. He glances over at his
	sister.

				JENNIFER
		Me too. Sounds swell.

				DAVID
			(pointed)
		Really? It seems so fattening.

	Before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind
	the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(staring straight ahead)
		There aren't any cheeseburgers.

				DAVID
			(exasperated)
		Look. I thought we talked about this, I
		thought we said ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh--what's the point, Bud?

	CLOSER.

	Mr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness
	in his eyes. David grabs his arm.

				DAVID
		C'mere.

	He pulls him along the counter toward a little office
	storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the
	door.

	INT. STOREROOM.

	It is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a
	small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a
	happy family motoring in their Rambler.

				DAVID
		What did you say?

	Mr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well ... I'm not sure I see the point
		anymore.

				DAVID
		What are you talking about! You make
		hamburgers! That is the point!

				MR. JOHNSON
		No I know ... I know I do ...
			(he pauses, then looks up)
		But it's always the same, you know?
		Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the
		cheese ... It never changes. It never
		gets any better or worse ...

				DAVID
		Just listen to me ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(not hearing him)
		... Like the other night, when I closed
		up by myself. That was different ...

				DAVID
		Forget about that!

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh ... Okay.
			(beat/
			lower)
		... But I really liked it.

	Bud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries
	to speak softly.

				DAVID
		Look, you can't always like what you do.
		Sometimes you just do it because it's
		your job. And even if you don't like it,
		you just gotta do it anyway.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Why?

				DAVID
			(exasperated)
		So they can have their hamburgers!

	This sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(like a secret)
		You know what I really like?

				DAVID
			(warily)
		... What's that?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Christmastime.

	David rolls his eyes. Mr. Johnson leans closer, speaking
	furtively.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint
		the Christmas decorations in the window.
		And every year, I get to paint a
		different thing ...
			(beat)
		One year it's the North Pole. The next
		I do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show
		you.

	He pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens
	it for David.

				DAVID
			(impressed)
		Wow ... That's pretty good ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		Thanks.
			(continuing)
		But this morning I was thinking about
		it and I realized that I looked forward
		to it all year. And then I thought "Gee.
		That seems awfully silly. That seems
		like an awfully long time to be waiting
		for just one moment, don't you think?"

	David looks at him speechless.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Well don't you?

				DAVID
		I think you should try not to think
		about this anymore.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Really?

				DAVID
		Yeah.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.

								CUT TO:

	INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

	The Barber Pole spins in three shades of gray. Several men
	are gathered around the two chairs in the front of Gus' shop.
	Besides being the barbershop, it is the bastion of all male
	life in Pleasantville. Bud and Mary Sue's "father" (George)
	sits in one of the chairs. "Big Bob" McGee, owner of the
	drugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the
	other. He has a crew cut that's getting shorter.

				GUS
		Have they ever lost before?

				GEORGE
		Basketball? No they sure haven't.

				BOB
		Just feels "wrong", that's all.

	There are several murmurs.

				THIRD PATRON
		Maybe that's where they get that saying,
		"can't win 'em all."

				GUS
		Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They
		do have that saying.

				BOB
		But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've
		always won 'em all.

				GUS
		Well, yeah. That's true too.

	More murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure.

								CUT TO:

	INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DAY.

	The women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen
	like it does every Wednesday afternoon. Four women are seated
	around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix
	between them. Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the
	woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office.

				MARGE
			(dealing the cards)
		... He said it would clear up on its
		own if she just stayed away from fried
		foods and sweets ...

				BETTY
		Well that makes sense.

				MARGE
		Except it's spread to her lips now too.
		Oh, I don't know.

				MARY
			(a THIRD WOMAN)
		And you say it's just "red?"

				MARGE
		Well--like red, only ... "redder."

				MARY
		Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like
		the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was
		going by it the other day and it looked
		green only "greener."

	SHOT. BETTY.

	She looks up quickly--then grabs some bridge mix.

				MARGE
			(lowering her voice)
		Have you seen him lately? The man
		doesn't look like himself. I was
		getting my sewing machine fixed across
		the street and he was sitting in the
		window of his shop just staring.
		Wasn't looking at anything in
		particular--just staring off into space.

				MARY
		That is strange.

	Betty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in
	front of her, when her eyes go wide.

	HER POV. BRIDGE HAND.

	They are ALL HEARTS and all BRIGHT RED. It looks like a
	fistfful of valentines.

	CLOSE UP. BETTY.

	She puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath.
	Betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before
	lifting them up and taking another look.

				MARGE
		Betty, it's your bid.

	She swallows trying to keep her composure.

				BETTY
		Uh ... Seven hearts.

	They murmur at the strength of the hand.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	The SOUND of the television plays OS while a warm light burns
	in the window.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	Jennifer and Betty stand at the sink finishing the dishes.
	Betty washes while Jennifer dries and it's clear who's more
	used to this. Jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places
	a dish in the drying rack.

				BETTY
		Mary Sue?

				JENNIFER
		Yeah?

	Betty hesitates. Rinses out a pot.

				BETTY
		Can I ask you a question?

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

	She pauses for a long moment.

				BETTY
		What goes on up at Lover's Lane?

				JENNIFER
			(turning toward her)
		What do you mean?

				BETTY
		Well, you hear all these things lately.
		You know--kids spending so much time up
		there ...
			(she looks over)
		Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?

				JENNIFER
		Yeah ...
			(beat)
		That--and ...

	She stops herself.

				BETTY
		What?

				JENNIFER
		It doesn't matter.

				BETTY
		No. I want to know.

				JENNIFER
			(glances toward the living room/
			lowers her voice)
		... Sex.

				BETTY
		Ah.

	Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A
	beat goes by ...

				BETTY (CONT)
		What's sex?

	Jennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at
	her with a blank, curious expression. Jennifer hesitates.

				JENNIFER
		You sure you want to know this?

				BETTY
		Yes.

				JENNIFER
		Okay.

	She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of
	the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to
	the kitchen counter and turns to her.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		You see Mom ...
			(softer and with understanding)
		When two people like each other very
		much ...

	Betty looks at her and nods ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

	The TV keeps flickering in the window.

	INT. KITCHEN. LATER ...

	The CAMERA PANS across the kitchen table where there is a
	full quart of milk and some uneaten co6kies. It finally comes
	to rest on Jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table
	with a concerned look on her face.

				JENNIFER
		You okay?

	REVERSE ANGLE. BETTY.

	She nods--shaken but "fine." Betty stares long and hard at
	the plate of chocolate chip cookies. She's far away.

				BETTY
		Yes ...
			(softly)
		It's just that ...

				JENNIFER
			(gently)
		What?

				BETTY
		Well ...
			(looking up)
		... Your father would never do anything
		like that.

	SHOT. JENNIFER.

	She bites her lip weighing her next sentence ...

				JENNIFER
			(leaning forward)
		Oh. Hmm ...
			(whisper/
			woman to woman)
		Well, Mom ... there's ways to "enjoy"
		yourself without Dad.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She looks across the table, perplexed.

								CUT TO:

	INT. PARKER BEDROOM. NIGHT.

	George crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the
	middle of the room. He wears long sleeve pajamas that are
	buttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk
	on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is
	barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering.

				GEORGE
		Sweetie? You coming to bed?

	There is no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Betty?

	INT. BATHROOM.

	She stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub. Her
	dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well.

				BETTY
			(calling out)
		Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath
		first.

	CLOSER. BETTY.

	She swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches
	for the spigot and turns on the water. Betty's heart beats a
	little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN.

	CLOSER STILL ...

	Betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top
	of her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor,
	standing naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances
	toward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a
	deep breath and steps into the tub.

	EVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ...

	Betty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the
	steam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like
	that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in
	the tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There
	is the slight trace of a smile.

	EXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE.

	Her eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently. The
	water continues to THUNDER DOWN as she arches her back.
	Betty's breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all
	over again:

	HER POV. BATHROOM ...

	ALL AT ONCE, EVERYTHING AROUND STARTS TO TURN FROM BLACK AND
	WHITE TO COLOR. A BIRD OUT THE WINDOW BECOMES A RED BREASTED
	ROBIN. THE TILE ON THE TUB TURNS OUT TO BE PURPLE. GREEN
	TOWEL ... PINK ROBE ... BRIGHT YELLOW DAISIES ON THE PLASTIC
	SHOWER CURTAIN.

	CLOSE UP. BETTY'S FACE.

	She stares in amazment. Beads of sweat form on Betty's
	forehead as the world goes to TECHNICOLOR. The THUNDERING
	WATER POUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND, but beneath can be heard the
	beginnings of a faint, low, MOAN. Her eyes dart around the
	room. Her breathing quickens: Faster ... Harder ... More
	intense ... THEN SUDDENLY ...

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	The HUGE ELM TREE across the street suddenly BURSTS INTO
	FLAMES. Fire shoots straight up into the sky as billowing
	clouds of black smoke fill the air. BRIGHT ORANGE FLAMES
	LIGHT UP THE NIGHT.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	David is staring at the television set when he notices a
	weird orange glow. He glances behind him, out the living room
	window ...

				DAVID
		Oh my God!

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	David comes racing out of the front door and down the walk. A
	small CROWD has gathered in front of the fire. (They don't
	seem frightened--just sort of amazed.) The street is still
	BLACK AND WHITE but it is now bathed in a weird ORANGE LIGHT.
	The flames leap higher and higher ...

				DAVID
		Jesus Christ ...

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He takes off down the block, as fast as he can run. The crowd
	continues to stare as David turns the corner at Main
	Street ...

	EXT. FIRE STATION.

	He races in the front of the building SCREAMING at the top of
	his lungs.

				DAVID
		FIRE! FIRE!

	INT. FIRE STATION.

	There is no sign of life on the ground floor. David races up
	the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story.

	INT. BUNKROOM.

	All the firemen are sitting around playing Gin Rummy when
	David rushes in the front door. They can hear his voice from
	down the hall.

				DAVID
			(entering)
		FIRE ... FIRE ...

	They still don't move. All the firemen just look at him from
	their bunks with a perplexed expression.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(beat)
		CAT!!!

	All at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets
	and their yellow slickers. They race to the landing just
	outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	The FIRE HAS SPREAD TO AN ADJOINING TREE as the FIRE ENGINE
	comes SCREAMING toward the house from the top of the block.
	David sits in the front of the truck next to the Fire Chief
	who drives the vehicle at break neck speed.

				DAVID
		Right here!

	The Fire ENGINE screeches to a halt. The Fire Chief looks
	around ...

				FIRE CHIEF
		Where is it?

	David shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He
	shakes his head and leaps from the truck.

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He races around to the back where the other firemen are
	standing just as confused. David grabs one of the hoses and
	begins to pull it from the truck.

				DAVID
		Here! Grab this nozzle.

				FIREMAN
		But where's the ...

				DAVID
		Just grab it!

	He strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the
	fireman and pulls him toward the curb. David parts the crowd
	and positions the man right in front of the flames.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(shouting)
		Okay! Now point this right at the
		flames--like this.

	The Fireman nods and does as he is told. David opens the
	valve sending out a huge FLUME OF WATER.

				FIREMAN
		Whoa!
			(beat)
		So that's what these do.

	A huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man
	who has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear
	to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another
	hose ...

				BOB (VO)
			(fading in)
		... In honor and in recognition of
		your heroism ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY

	David stands at a podium receiving a commendation from "Big"
	Bob McGee (the man from the barbershop). He holds a large
	plaque up for public display, while "David's" whole family
	beams in the background.

				BOB
		... And with great appreciation from
		the citizens of Pleasantville ...

	WIDER.

	A huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps. There are
	lots of balloons and bunting.

				BOB
		I am pleased to present You with this
		special commendation, from the
		Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce!

	He hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into
	APPLAUSE.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ...

	David walks away from the center of town looking down at his
	plaque. He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge
	when a young woman comes up beside him.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Hi Bud ...

	WIDER.

	She is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school,
	and one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka
	dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure.
	Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence.

				MARGARET
		That was sure swell ...

				DAVID
		Oh. Thanks, Margaret.

				MARGARET
			(smiling)
		I baked you my oatmeal cookies.

				DAVID
			(vaguely remembering an episode)
		Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.

				MARGARET
		No. I baked them for you.

				DAVID
		No. You baked them for Whitey.

				MARGARET
			(low and gutteral)
		No. I baked them for you.

	All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up
	against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her
	mouth is inches away from his.

				DAVID
		Um ... thanks.

	David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and
	freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment,
	unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville
	smile.

				MARGARET
		See ya.

	She turns and heads around the comer, while David just
	watches her dumbstruck.

								CUT TO:

	SODA SHOP. DUSK.

	David heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat.
	The BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to "hip" '50s JAZZ. DAVE
	BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a
	moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.

	SODA SHOP.

	The place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage
	hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house
	now. Brubeck's "TAKE FIVE" plays in the background while
	several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.

	DOORWAY.

	David walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of
	the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz
	on a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table.
	Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him.

				JENNIFER
			(in a whisper)
		I had nothing to do with that fire.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		It's okay.

				JENNIFER
		Not directly anyhow ...

				DAVID
		It's fine.

	David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the
	bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at
	him, with a weird expression of awe.

				JENNIFER
			(still under her breath)
		Um ... They like wanna ask you a
		question ... I didn't know how to
		handle it. So ...

				DAVID
		Sure.

	He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at
	him. It's like Elvis has entered the building.

				DAVID (CONT)
		How you doin?

				VARIOUS KIDS
		Swell ...

	They keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and
	forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ...

				BOY
		How'd you know about the fire?

				DAVID
		What?

				BOY
		How'd you know how to put it out and
		all?

	David hesitates, weighing his words.

				DAVID
		Well--where I used to live ...
		That's just what firemen did.

	This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.

				BOY
		And where's that?

				DAVID
			(carefully)
		Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

	This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids.
	It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A
	hush descends.

				BOY
		What's outside of Pleasantville?

				DAVID
		Look it doesn't matter. It's not
		important.

				BOY
		What is it?

	David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on
	every word.

				DAVID
		It's really not important.

				GIRL'S VOICE (OS)
		What's outside of Pleasantville?

	REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY.

	Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the
	doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the
	same excitement as the others, it just means so much more.

				MARGARET (CONT)
			(hungry for knowledge)
		C'mon. Tell us ...

	She stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might
	as well be touching him.

				DAVID
			(slowly)
		Well ... There are some places where
		the road doesn't go in a circle.
		There are some places where it keeps
		on going.

	There's an excited giggle. They lean forward.

				MARGARET
			(an exotic concept)
		Keeps going ...

				DAVID
		Well--it all just keeps going.
		Roads ... rivers ...

				2ND BOY
			(from the back)
		Like the "Mighty Mississippi".

				DAVID
		... What?

	He moves forward extending a book. The cover reads: "THE
	ADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY FINN." David opens the first page.
	There is printing inside.

				BOY
			(quoting)
		"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin'
		an' goin' as far you could see."

				DAVID
			(turning to Jennifer)
		I thought the books were blank?

				JENNIFER
		They were.

	He looks over at her.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
			(quickly)
		Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault.
		They asked me what it was about and I
		like didn't remember 'cause we had it
		back in tenth grade, But I told them
		what I DID remember, and the next
		thing I knew the pages had filled in.

				DAVID
		The pages filled in?

				JENNIFER
		But like only up to the part about
		the raft, because I didn't read any
		farther.

	CLOSER.

	David flips through the book and sure enough only the first
	chapter has print. The pages are blank after that.

				2ND BOY 
		Do you know how it ends?

				DAVID
			(hesitating)
		Well, yeah ... I do.

				MARGARET
			(breathless)
		So how does it end?

	She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of
	feet away. It's silent in the soda shop.

				DAVID
		Well--see ... they're both running
		away--Huck and the slave ... And ...
		They go up the river ... But--in
		trying to get free they sort of see
		that they're free already.

	David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book
	that aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE
	materialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the
	book, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(quietly)
		Oh my God.

				2ND BOY
		Wow!

				3RD BOY
		Do you know this one?

	He shoves another book in front of David.

				DAVID
		Hunh?
			(looks down at the book)
		Oh yeah ... Well this is great.
			(beat)
		See--Holden Caulfield is like this
		really lonely kid...

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY. DAY.

	The CAMERA PANS down from the "PUBLIC LIBRARY' sign to find
	the front door. A long line of kids waiting to check out
	their books stretches onto the sidewalk ...

	EXTREME WIDE SHOT. LIBRARY. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

	Several men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to
	the spinning barber pole. They watch the spectacle for a
	moment or two, as teenager after teenager exits with an
	armful of books.

				GUS
		I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.

				PHIL
		I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.

	Big Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut.

				PHIL (CONT)
		I mean goin' up to that lake all the
		time is one thing, but now they're
		going to a library! I mean what's next?

				BURT
		Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda.
		That's where they oughtta be.

	WIDER STILL.

	From the shadows of the Town Hall, up the block, David
	watches the stream of kids emerge with their books. They
	cradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound
	treasure ...

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

	George sits on the edge of his Barka Lounger, across the
	coffee table from "Big" Bob McGee. Even sitting down the man
	is a looming presence. Besides owning the market, auto
	dealership, hardware store, and gas station, he also owns the
	insurance agency where George works. George sweats into his
	collar.

				GEORGE
		Want some bridge mix?

				BOB
		Oh, no thanks ...

				GEORGE
		Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...

				BOB
		I'm fine--but thank you.

	George nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans
	forward.

				BOB (CONT)
		George, you're probably wondering why
		I asked if I could come over today ...

	George shrugs--then nods--then shrugs ...

				BOB (CONT)
		I'm sure you've noticed the same
		things we all have--certain "changes"
		going on in the town.
			(beat)
		You know what I mean by "changes"?

				GEORGE
		"Changes."

				BOB
			(nodding)
		"Changes."
			(takes a belt of martini)
		And it's not just the fire or big
		stuff like that. It's little things.
			(beat)
		Did you hear about Bill Miller?

				GEORGE
			(concerned)
		No. What?

				BOB
		Wife wants him to get one of those
		new beds.

				GEORGE
		One of those ... big beds?

	Bob nods.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?

				BOB
		I really don't know.
			(beat)
		Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a
		boxboy at the market.

				GEORGE
		... How?

				BIG BOB
		Said he didn't want to do it anymore.
		Just took off his apron in the middle
		of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her
		groceries spread all over the counter
		... Took 'em four hours to sort the
		whole thing out.

				GEORGE
		Holy cow.

	Bob takes a belt of his drink ...

				BIG BOB
		George, everyone likes you.

				GEORGE
		Oh well ...

				BOB
		No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause
		you're a great bowler ... They respect
		you ...

				GEORGE
			(heartfelt)
		Thank you very much.

				BOB
		And it's important for them to see
		someone they respect, stand up for
		what's right. If you love a place,
		you can't sit around and watch this
		kind of thing happen to it.

				GEORGE
		No. Of course not.

				BOB
			(big patriarchal smile)
		And that's why I want you to be on
		the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.

				GEORGE
			(stunned/
			moved)
		Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

				BOB
			(smiling)
		Why don't you start by saying "yes,"
		and then getting me one of those swell
		pineapple kabobs.

				GEORGE
		Oh sure ... You bet.
			(calling out)
		Betty ...

	There is no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)
			(louder this time)
		BETTY ...

	Still no answer.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR
		GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ...

	WIDER.

	George turns around to see David, standing on the landing,
	listening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a
	moment ...

				DAVID
		I'll get her.

	He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him.

	INT. KITCHEN.

	David gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across
	the room to see:

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	Betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the
	window. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen
	counter.

				DAVID
			(approaching slowly)
		Are you okay?

	She doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on
	her shoulder.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Are you alright?

	Betty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED
	COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED.
	SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole
	thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the
	tear stains on either side of her face.

				BETTY
			(fighting tears)
		What am I going to do?

	David moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering.

				DAVID
		It's okay. It's alright.

				BETTY
			(trembling)
		I can't go out there. How can I go out
		there?

	She looks right up at David.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(quieter)
		Look at me ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear
	and confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile.

				DAVID
		Have you got any make up?

				BETTY
		In my handbag.

	He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits
	Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for
	her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.

				DAVID
		Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.

	He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude,
	Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY
	powder puff.

	CLOSER.

	It is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup,
	she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones
	disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a
	DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.

	REVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.

	He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back.
	All at once, David seems to wince:

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.

	The life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone
	from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the
	fictional version of herself all over again.

				BETTY
			(off his reaction)
		What?

	David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the
	compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her
	face, turning her head first right, then left.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(beat)
		Does it look okay?

				DAVID
		Looks just like it did.

				BETTY
		And they won't be able to tell?

				DAVID
			(even quieter)
		No ... They won't be able to tell.

	Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the
	plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before
	she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide
	"stewardess" smile ...

				DAVID (CONT)
		Wait.

				BETTY
			(turning back)
		What?

	He wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his
	head.

				DAVID
		It's fine.

	She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.

				BETTY
		Thank you.

				DAVID
			(sadly)
		Sure.

	He watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room,
	extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of
	her ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. DAY.

	Mr. Johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin
	dispensers. He whistles BRUBECK'S "TAKE FIVE" when the screen
	door slams behind him. Mr. Johnson looks up with a start.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh, hi.

				DAVID
			(entering)
		Hi.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Aren't you a little early?

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		I brought you something ... From the
		library.

	CLOSER. FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three
	feet long. Mr. Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as
	David crosses to the counter.

				DAVID
		It's an art book.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh my Gosh, Bud ...

				DAVID
		Open it.

	Mr. Johnson reaches out and opens the cover. After a beat,
	his eyes widen.

				DAVID (CONT)
		I just thought since you liked
		painting it might help to ...

	Mr. Johnson gasps. It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a
	gasp. David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages.

	HIS POV. (INSERT) ART BOOK ...

	Massacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in
	vibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset
	by their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE ...

	Titian's "Venus to Utano". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden
	light. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of
	her flesh almost seem to glow ...

	Rembrandt's "Self Portrait." Dark reds, umbers, blacks and
	browns. He looks back at Mr. Johnson with pain and wisdom.
	There's a brilliant light on his hair.

				MR. JOHNSON (OS)
		Mmmmgh ...

	Faintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA
	begins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be
	sure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with
	your eyes.

	He TURNS THE PAGES faster. Breugal's "Harvesters" ... Tumees
	"Steam Train" ... Monet's "Cathedralo" ... Cezanne's
	"Oranges" ... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.

	WIDER. SODA SHOP.

	They sit like that for a beat.

				MR. JOHNSON
		It's beautiful, Bud ...

	He looks up at David, troubled.

				DAVID
		What's wrong?

				MR. JOHNSON
		I'll never be able to do that.

				DAVID
		Oh, well--you're just starting out.
		I mean, you can't do it ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		No, that's not it.

	Mr. Johnson shuts the book gently.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Where am I going to see colors like
		that?

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	What can he say. David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just
	smiles and shrugs.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Must be awfully lucky to see colors
		like that. I bet they don't even know
		how lucky they are.

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He just stares for a second.

	EXT. MAIN STREET. LONG SHOT. DAY.

	Margaret walks up the center of Main Street toward the CAMERA
	with her books pressed against her chest. She passes the
	drugstore, then the hardware store ... Far off in the
	distance, a young man comes racing out of the soda shop,
	pulling off his little paper hat as he goes. He comes running
	up behind her as fast as he can.

	CLOSER.

	He takes a deep breath and tries to quiet the panting.

				DAVID
		Hi.

				MARGARET
			(turning/
			lighting up)
		Oh ... Hi.

				DAVID
			(pause)
		Look, I probably shouldn't be asking
		you this--not knowing you that well
		and all ...

	Margaret stops in the street and turns to him.

				DAVID (CONT)
		It's just that my folks are gonna
		stay home and they said I could use
		their car.
			(moment of truth/
			abandoning his speech)
		... You want to go out with me
		tonight?

	He wants to turn away but doesn't. David forces himself to
	stare at her and all of a sudden she beams. It's the whitest,
	pearliest smile in the world.

				MARGARET
			(breathless)
		Sure ... Where would we go?

				DAVID
			(swallows)
		... Lover's Lane?

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. DAY.

	David comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation.
	He vaults over a parking meter, swings around a lampost and
	leaps off the bumper of a parked car. David hi-fives into the
	air at no one in particular and sails over Mr. Simpson's
	hedge almost decking him in the process.

				DAVID
			(calling back)
		Sorry ...

	FOLLOWING DAVID.

	He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All
	American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a
	time flinging open the door.

	INT. PARKER HOUSE. FOYER.

				DAVID
		"Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching
		in ..."

	He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron
	and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs,
	when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room.

				MAN'S VOICE (OS)
		Bud ...

	He pauses a second and glances back.

				MAN'S VOICE (CONT)
		David ...

	He peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer ...

	HIS POV. TELEVISION.

	Dick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the
	TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Hello there.

				DAVID
			(wary)
		... Hi.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(stage whisper)
		Well c'mere, young fella.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David crosses slowly over to the TV set.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(big smile)
		You know I've been thinkin' ... I
		might have been a little "hasty"
		the other day when you asked to come
		home--just took me by such surprise,
		ya know--ha ha ...

	He gives a goony laugh. David just looks at him ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		So even though I can't make any
		promises, well--I figured if you
		asked me real nice--I might just be
		willing to talk about it again.

				DAVID
			(quickly)
		I can't.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What?

				DAVID
		Talk about it. Right now, I mean.
		I got to ... um ...

	The look turns suddenly dark and ominous.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Bud--I thought you wanted to come
		home.

				DAVID
		Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I
		told my "dad" I'd clean out the
		rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted
		me to ... to change the tape in the
		register ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(getting testy)
		I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm
		getting sorta concerned about what
		I'm seeing in some of these
		re-runs ...

				DAVID
		Re-runs?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Like when Margaret Henderson makes
		her cookies for Whitey.
			(losing it a little)
		... Those aren't your cookies Bud.

				DAVID
		Oh, I know they're not. But I mean--
		they're just "cookies" after all ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Excuse me?

				DAVID
		Well they're not just cookies. I
		mean, they're great cookies ...
		Look, I'd love to get into this
		whole thing but I'm really running
		late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		BUD.

				DAVID
		Terrific. I'll talk to you then.

	He swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic
	limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room,
	breathing hard ...

	INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM.

	She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a
	book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to
	open it when she senses something and glances toward the
	door.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems
	to be out of breath.

				JENNIFER
		What's wrong?

				DAVID
		Nothing.

				JENNIFER
		Nothing?

	He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the
	remote in his hand.

				DAVID
		Listen ...

	He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly
	stops.

				DAVID (CONT)
		You're reading?

				JENNIFER
			(glancing at the book)
		Yeah. Can't believe you started such
		a dorky fad.

	She holds up the cover.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?

				DAVID
			(amazed)
		... Yeah.

				JENNIFER
		Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35
		pages.

				DAVID
			(still stunned)
		That's great.

	He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to
	drift ...

				JENNIFER
		So what is it?

				DAVID
		Well ... I just ...
			(out of the blue)
		Can I ask you a question?

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				DAVID
		Remember when you told me that Lisa
		Rosenberg liked me?

				JENNIFER
		Yeah ...

				DAVID
		Well--did she really like me or were
		you just making that up.

				JENNIFER
		No. She really liked you.

				DAVID
		You weren't playing a joke? She
		woulda gone out with me?

				JENNIFER
		Gone out with you. She woulda like
		rearranged your tonsils.

				DAVID
		Wow.

	He looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity.

				JENNIFER
		Can I ask you a question?

				DAVID
		Yes.

				JENNIFER
		How come I'm still in black and white?

				DAVID
			(back to earth)
		What?

				JENNIFER
		Well I've had like ten times as
		much sex as these girls and I'm
		still like this. They have one hour
		in the back of a car and suddenly
		they're in technicolor.

				DAVID
		Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...
			(thinks)
		... it's not just the sex ...

				JENNIFER
			(looking up quickly)
		What?

	She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard
	their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's
	calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her
	expression changes: a vague look of recognition.

				JENNIFER (CONT)
		No, it's not just the sex, is it?

	She glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes
	a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After
	a second or two, she looks back. David looks at her for a
	beat ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.

	David gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen
	"gray" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front
	walk ...

	INT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ...

	David sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret
	Henderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road,
	holding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his
	right.

	HIS POV. MARGARET.

	It's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes
	her glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm
	wind that swirls inside the convertible ...

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to
	avoid a parked car on his right ...

	WIDER.

	They pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads:

	"NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE"

	Main Street turns into a winding country road as they leave
	the town behind and head off into the woods. They wind
	through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a
	second sign appears, much like the first:

	"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE"

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

	Sure enough, the town emerges in front of them again,
	completing the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.

				MARGARET
		Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

				DAVID
		Oh ... Right.

	He looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.

	EXT. CAR. DUSK.

	SAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto
	a smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small
	hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road.
	It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the
	crest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a
	deep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat
	between them ...

	HIS POV. CAR SEAT.

	THE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They
	sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ...

	INT. CAR.

	David looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems
	to be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have
	started to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty
	percent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false
	spring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as
	they finally reach a crest in the hill.

				DAVID
		Wow.

	THEIR POV. LOVERS LANE.

	There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone
	Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW
	IS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS (all "turned" now)
	SWIRL IN THE WIND LIKE SOME STRANGE PINK SNOWSTORM. A LONG
	LINE OF PASTEL CARS STRETCHES OUT ALONG THE SHORE.

				SAM COOKE (VO)
			(over the car radios)
		"Cupid, draw back your bow ..."

	SHOT. CAR.

	Slowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids
	have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by
	the edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It
	almost looks "Athenian."

	INT. CAR.

	David looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly
	cocks his head to the side.

				DAVID
		What's that smell?

	Margaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the
	convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is
	blooming beside the car.

				MARGARET
		Aren't these great?

	David takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes
	a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to
	relax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like
	some strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the
	flower ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK.

	Betty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on
	either hand. From a block away, she looks like any other
	homemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray
	make-up.

	CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.

	She nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in
	the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street
	when she glances up, and suddenly stops.

	HER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.

	There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda
	shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for
	the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It
	is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks
	like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject
	matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres
	and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist
	Santa hovering over the roof tops.

	SHOT. BETTY.

	She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to
	wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the
	business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of
	the block, staring straight ahead.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	The door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the
	place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining
	through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances
	around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.

				MR. JOHNSON (OS)
		We're closed right now ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a
	board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his
	shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Oh, hi ...

				BETTY
			(turning to leave)
		I'm sorry ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		No, no ... Come on in.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still
	holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist
	Christmas" in the window.

				BETTY
		I just thought ... It's beautiful.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Thanks.

	Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr.
	Johnson motions toward his easel.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		I was just trying to do one of these
		"still lifes."

	He sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of
	GRAY FRUIT.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Having kind of a tough time.

				BETTY
		I think it looks nice.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well ...
			(shrugs)
		Here's what it's s'posed to look like.

	He leads her over to the table and points down at the art
	book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.

				BETTY
		Oh my ...

	CLOSER.

	They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at
	the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears
	into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Here. Look at this.

	He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is
	nearly electric.

				BETTY
			(breathless)
		Where'd you get this?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Bud brought it to me.

				BETTY
		Bud?

				MR. JOHNSON
		Here's my favorite.

	INSERT. BOOK.

	He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping
	Women." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her
	head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own
	shoulder.

				MR. JOHNSON
		What do you think?

	She doesn't answer ...

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		Isn't it great how she's resting like
		that?

				BETTY
			(faintly)
		She's crying.

	WIDER.

	Mr. Johnson looks down at the painting.

				MR. JOHNSON
		What?

				BETTY
		She's crying.

				MR. JOHNSON
		No she's not.

				BETTY
		Yes she is.

	He looks up at her ...

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it
	and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just
	wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP.
	A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.

	ANGLE. MR. JOHNSON.

	He stares up at her in amazement.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She senses something and glances down at her hand. Her
	fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts
	for the door.

	WIDER.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(following her)
		Wait ...

				BETTY
		I've got to go ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		It's alright.

	He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the
	wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		It's alright. Let me see.

				BETTY
			(shame)
		No ...

	He reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves
	around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.

				MR. JOHNSON
		It's beautiful.

	CLOSER ...

	She freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly,
	turns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed
	underneath. Betty stands there exposed.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(a whisper)
		... It's beautiful.

	She swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		You shouldn't cover that up.

	Mr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on
	the counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at
	the tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he
	starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.

	CLOSER STILL ...

	She recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr.
	Johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and
	acceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make
	a decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing
	her flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues
	to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the
	beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...

								CUT TO:
	INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT.

	She lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing
	earlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the
	pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a
	moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting
	the book. The cover is plainly visible: "LADY CHATTERLY'S
	LOVER."

	CLOSER.

	She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed
	and crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens
	the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and
	doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She
	could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the
	little desk.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	She flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is
	bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony
	tail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired
	and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer
	notices something across the desk.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	A pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of
	her. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances
	back down at the print.

				JENNIFER
			(impressed)
		Hunh.

	She can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in
	front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked
	the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER
	FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is
	the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look
	on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel
	when there is a loud TAP on the window.

	She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer
	slides open the window.

	EXT. PARKER HOUSE.

	Biff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window.

				BIFF
		Mary Sue--C'mon ...

				JENNIFER
			(leaning out the window)
		What are you doing?

				BIFF
			(jiggling in anticipation)
		It's six-thirty ...

				JENNIFER
		So.

				BIFF
		We were gonna ... You know ...

	He jiggles some more.

				JENNIFER
		Oh.
			(remembering)
		I can't.

				BIFF
		Why not?

	She glances down at her book.

				JENNIFER
		I'm busy.

				BIFF
			(surprised)
		With what?

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk. Her
	own image in the silver frame stares back at her. The hair is
	pulled back in a pony tail. The glasses sit on the front of
	her nose.

				JENNIFER
			(turning to Biff)
		I'm studying.

	She thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles. Biff
	stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and
	quietly closes the window ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out
	across the water. Even in the moonlight, the COLORS are
	vivid. David still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking
	a long hit like an Opium addict.

				DAVID
			(inhaling)
		Mmmmgh.

				MARGARET
		Do they have those ... Where you come
		from?

				DAVID
		Yeah ... I guess.
			(beat)
		I don't know.

				MARGARET
		You don't know?

	Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on
	the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a
	long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her
	shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.

				MARGARET (CONT)
		So what's it like?

				DAVID
		What?

				MARGARET
			(a whisper)
		Out there.

	She clings onto the words like they could transport her by
	themselves. David thinks for a moment.

				DAVID
		Oh. don't know ... It's different.

	She leans forward.

				MARGARET
		How?

				DAVID
		Well it's louder ... And scarier I
		guess ... And ... and a lot more
		dangerous ...

				MARGARET
		Sounds fantastic. You know some kids
		came up here the other night to go
		swimming--took off all their clothes.

	She giggles. David looks at her in amazement.

				MARGARET (CONT)
		Do they have an Ocean? I've heard
		about the ocean.

				DAVID
		Yeah.

				MARGARET
		What's that like?

				DAVID
		Well it's big. And it's blue ...
			(as if realizing it for the first time)
		... It's really really blue.

				MARGARET
		Mmmm.
			(beat)
		Boy. It's hot up here.

	Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan
	sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the
	figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts.
	She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it
	forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater
	across the grass and leans back on it.

				MARGARET (CONT)
		You want some berries?

				DAVID
		Hunh?

	She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in
	REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES.

				MARGARET
		I picked them myself. They grow wild
		up here.
			(eating one)
		Mmm. So sweet.

				DAVID
			(looking at them)
		They just grow like that?

				MARGARET
			(looking straight up)
		Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff.
		Currants and strawberries ... Here.
		I'll show you.

	She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her
	heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and
	reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a
	piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers
	back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ...

				MARGARET (CONT)
		Here.

	CLOSER.

	Margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED
	APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the
	moonlight.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a
	whisper.

				MARGARET
		Go on. Try it.

	HIS POV.

	She is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched
	apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is
	smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David
	reaches out and takes it.

	WIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET.

	For this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks
	down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates
	for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	George heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a
	happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache
	case as he turns and heads up his front walk.

	INT. FOYER.

	George opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs
	like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his
	coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly
	greeting:

				GEORGE
		Honey--I'm home.

	There is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles
	as he calls out again:

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Honey--I'm home ...

	There is more silence. George looks around a little confused
	when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	Betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of
	fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully
	with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel,
	painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks
	radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER
	FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ...

	CLOSER.

	She looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP
	OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER
	BOOM ...

	ANGLE. WINDOW.

	The "Cubist Snowscene" lights up brightly, illuminated by the
	sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the
	chair and crosses to the window looking out.

				BETTY
			(frightened)
		What is that?

				MR. JOHNSON
		I don't know.

	Betty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the
	painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide.

	REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING.

	It is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that
	isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him
	fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual
	nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself
	revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges
	and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime.
	There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER.

	WIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON.

	She looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a
	moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to
	run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing
	it, moves slightly closer.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At
	first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF
	THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the
	RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in
	the sky.

				MARGARET
		What is that?

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the
	increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks
	to him in terror.

				MARGARET
		What's going on?

				DAVID
		Rain.

				MARGARET
		Real rain?

				DAVID
		Yeah ... You don't have rain either?

	She looks at him frightened. David smiles.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Right. Of course you don't ...

	He puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the
	grassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank,
	looking in terror at the water falling from the sky.

				MARGARET
		What do we do?

				DAVID
			(reaching the car)
		We'll just put up the top.

	He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the
	catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing
	around as the rain starts to pound harder.

				MARGARET
		What top?

	He looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched
	in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to
	shiver.

				DAVID
		It's fine. Come on.

	He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the
	kids are clustered together. They look at one another,
	terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an
	overhanging rock.

				DAVID (CONT)
		It's alright. There's nothing to be
		afraid of.

	They look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him
	positively adoringly. She clings to his shoulder as the storm
	howls a few feet away ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. NIGHT.

	She stands at the window looking out at the driving rain.
	Jennifer still holds the D.H. Lawrence book in her hand.
	There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of
	thunder.

				JENNIFER
		Cool ...

	She flops back down on the bed and continues to read ...

	PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	George wanders through the empty and darkened house
	completely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around
	for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms
	and the sound of the driving storm.

				GEORGE
			(a little frightened/
			a little petulant)
		Honey, I'm home ...

	He still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM.
	The lights are dark there as well and he looks around
	confused.

				GEORGE (CONT)
			(baffled)
		Where's my dinner?

	He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking
	smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's
	empty as well.

	KITCHEN.

	He crosses into the darkness ...

				GEORGE
		Where's my dinner ...

	INT. FOYER.

	George comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer. He
	slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going ...

				GEORGE
			(insistent)
		Where's my DINNER ...

	EXT. HOUSE.

	It's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy
	sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind. The front door
	opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still
	dressed in his shirtsleeves.

				GEORGE
		Where's my DINNER!

	ON GEORGE.

	He stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete
	confusion. The rain pounds against his body and within
	seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin.

				GEORGE
			(over the storm)
		WHERE'S MY DINNER ...

	EXT. ELM STREET.

	A tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling
	through the torrent. George reels down Elm Street screaming
	skyward in the distance.

				GEORGE
		... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY
		DINNER!

	SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE ...

	He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance
	agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he
	passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ...
	Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well
	with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain.
	George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened
	shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ...

				GEORGE
			(plaintively)
		Where's my dinner?

	He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk.

	INT. BOWLING ALLEY. NIGHT.

	The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across
	three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt,
	sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses.

	The NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there
	aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...

	ANGLE. BIG BOB.

	He picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He
	starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up
	and suddenly stops.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	George is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold
	and shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His
	hair is drenched and dripping.

				BOB
		What happened?

	He doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps
	shivering.

	WIDER.

	The men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a
	couple of times, still soaked to the bone.

				BOB
		Are you alright?
			(looking at him)
		What is it?

				GEORGE
			(faintly)
		Rain.

				BOB
			(beat)
		Real rain?

	George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling
	alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning
	lights up the sky.

				BOB (CONT)
		Oh my God ...

	He turns back to George.

				BOB (CONT)
		... We had no idea. Burt was rolling
		a 250 and ...
			(beat)
		Are you alright?

	George shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches
	and guides him into the seat ...

				BOB (CONT)
		What happened?

				GEORGE
			(still shivering)
		Well, I ... I came home like I always
		do, And I came in the front door. And
		I took off my coat. And I put down my
		briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."

	ANGLE. MEN.

	They all nod in recognition.

	ANGLE. GEORGE.

				GEORGE
		... Only no one was there.

	A MURMUR goes through the men.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		So I went into the kitchen and I
		yelled it again. "Honey--I'm home."
		But there was no one there either.
		No wife. No lights. No dinner.

	They all GASP.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		So I went to the oven--you know--
		because I thought maybe she had made
		me one of those "TV dinners ..."

	The men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		But she hadn't. She was gone.

	A LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his
	head and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up
	and puts a hand on his shoulder.

				BOB
			(gently/
			the patriarch)
		... It's gonna be fine George.

	George looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly
	on the back.

				GUS
		What do we do Bob?

				BOB
		Well--we'll be safe for now--thank
		goodness we're in a bowling alley--
		but if George here doesn't get his
		dinner, any one of us could be next.
		It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or
		even you Phil ...

	They murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam.

				BOB (CONT)
			(like a WWII movie)
		... That's real rain out there
		gentlemen. This isn't some little
		"virus" that's going to "clear up on
		it's own." There's something
		happening to our town and I think we
		can all see where it comes from.

	They nod in agreement.

				BOB (CONT)
		We're gonna need a town meeting.
		Phil, how fast can you turn around
		a leaflet in your print shop?

				PHIL
		Couple of hours.

				BOB
		Gus, why don't you get a bunch of
		kids from the basketball team to help
		you put them up on lamposts and tree
		trunks ...

	Gus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm,
	patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder.

				BOB (CONT)
			(soothingly)
		And the first thing you're gonna do
		is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice
		dry bowling shirt.

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	The rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson
	are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through
	Mr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft
	radiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow
	pink ...

				MR. JOHNSON
		You can't go out there.

				BETTY
		But I really should get home.

				MR. JOHNSON
		But you can't go out there.

	There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of
	THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her
	eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the
	roof.

				BETTY
		Sounds nice ... Once you get used
		to it.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(listening)
		Yeah. It does.

	There is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this
	time.

				BETTY
		Like a drum.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Yeah.
			(thinks)
		Or like sprinklers in the summer ...

	Betty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear
	seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as
	Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr.
	Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two.
	Betty starts to smile ...

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

	David huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she
	nestles against him with her head on his shoulder.

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting
	image of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses
	have slipped down her nose. There is another fork of
	lightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer
	smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her
	shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page.

								CUT TO:

	CLOSE UP. A BRIGHT RED ROSE.

	Drops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT
	RED IN THE MORNING SUN ...

	AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE.

	The rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight
	complete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky.
	Literally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the
	black and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	Betty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each
	other's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming
	Mr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens
	his eyes and looks outside ...

				MR. JOHNSON
			(seeing the rainbow)
		Oh my Gosh ...

	EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

	Birds are chirping. David and Margaret also lie asleep in
	each other's arms, beneath the shelter of the rocky overhang.
	Margaret lifts up and sees the rainbow. She has turned to
	color as well ...

				MARGARET
			(awed)
		Oh my God ...

	INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

	She has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest.
	Jennifer's hair is still tied in a bun and she still wears
	Mary Sue's glasses, but her face has returned to its rosy
	pink hue. She blinks open her eyes, feeling the sunlight, and
	looks out the window.

				JENNIFER
			(looking at the rainbow)
		Oh my God ...

	INT. BOWLING ALLEY.

	The men are all passed out across the various lanes and
	scoring tables. It looks like a YMCA shelter. After a moment
	or two Big Bob yawns, and stretches, and glances out the
	glass doorway. He sees the rainbow and freezes in shock.

				BOB
			(horrified)
		Oh my GOD!

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM ST. DAY.

	David comes gliding up Maple Street in the sunshine with a
	huge smile on his face. He has that special grin and faraway
	look that a boy only knows once in his life. Perplexingly he
	is still in black and white. Bud turns on Elm Street and
	starts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly
	freezes.

	HIS POV. TREE TRUNK.

	There, tacked to the bark, is a hastily scrawled public
	notice:

	TOWN MEETING TONIGHT
	ALL "TRUE" CITIZENS
	OF PLEASANTVILLE

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He looks up at it for a moment.

	INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DUSK.

	George and Betty stand face to face in their suburban
	kitchen. He is black and white. She is in full color.

				BETTY
		I told you where I was.

				GEORGE
		All night?

				BETTY
		I got caught in the storm. You were
		gone all night too.

				GEORGE
			(the ultimate defense)
		I was in a bowling-alley.

	Betty turns--glances out the window.

				GEORGE (CONT)
			(sudden smile)
		Look. Let's just forget about it.
		Let's just go to the meeting and ...

				BETTY
		I told you, George. I'm not going.

				GEORGE
			(bigger smile)
		Sure you are.

				BETTY
		No I'm not.

	She turns to face him. George flinches slightly.

				BETTY (CONT)
		Look at me George. That meeting's not
		for me. Look at my face.

				GEORGE
		It's fine. You'll put on some make up
		and ...

				BETTY
		I don't want to put on some make up ...

	George's eyes widen. It's a watershed moment.

				GEORGE
			(protesting)
		It goes away ... It'll go away.

				BETTY
			(gently)
		I don't want it to go away.

	He suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his
	chest.

				GEORGE
			(the '50s patriarch)
		Okay--now you listen to me ...
			(beat)
		You're gonna come to this meeting and
		you're gonna put on this make up, and
		you're gonna come home at six o'clock
		every night and have dinner ready on
		this table.

				BETTY
			(softly)
		No I'm not sweetie.

	His expression leaves as quickly as it came. Betty moves
	closer to him.

				BETTY (CONT)
			(half whisper)
		... There's a meatloaf in the fridge.
		You just put it in the oven and turn
		this little knob up to three-fifty.
		If you put the pie in forty minutes
		later, it'll be hot in time for
		dessert.

	George's eyes widen.

				BETTY (CONT)
		I made a couple of lunches for you
		and put them in brown paper bags ...
			(much quieter)
		I'm gonna go now.

				GEORGE
		Where are you gonna go?

				BETTY
		I'm gonna go now.

	She turns and starts out the kitchen door when George calls
	after her.

				GEORGE
		Betty, don't go out there like that!
		They'll see you!
			(beat)
		They'll SEE you!

	And she closes the door behind her.

				GEORGE (CONT)
		Betty, come back here!

	EXT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

	Dozens of black and white citizens stream in through the
	front door.

	SHOT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET.

	Several "transformed" teenagers stare at the spectacle with
	their FLESH COLORED SKIN AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES. They seem to
	hang back in the shadows.

	INT. TOWN HALL.

	Big Bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that
	reads "PLEASANTVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE." As the only
	legally constituted body in Pleasantville, it is a natural
	place for a town meeting. There is nothing bright and cheery
	however. The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming
	shadows up the walls. The light at the podium bathes Big
	Bob's face in a blinding splash of light. The whole thing
	evokes some weird twisted image from German Expressionism--
	like they are about to go look for Frankenstein. It is grayer
	than gray.

	CLOSER. PODIUM.

	Big Bob stands at a lectern with a Rotary insignia on the
	front. He speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and
	women who hang on his every word. Bob holds a BRIGHT YELLOW
	GRAPEFRUIT.

				BOB
		This was found over in Dave Murphy's
		trash can. There were four of them
		like this ...

	There is a murmur from the crowd ...

	CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

	He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind
	Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a
	full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic
	and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a
	shiny new pin can give you.

	SHOT. BOB.

	He holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS.

				BOB
		Jane Davidson found these in her
		son's laundry basket.

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats.
	Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair.

				BOB (CONT)
		This is from Mary Petersen's front
		porch. She found one last week.
		There were two more this morning ...

	The MURMUR starts to grow ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

	David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside
	Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap
	their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The
	meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a
	moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a
	beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright
	RED bow.

				DAVID
			(softly)
		I got you something.

	Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the
	wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real
	umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled.

				MARGARET
		It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?

				DAVID
		It was a prop for the school play ...

	She looks down and giggles.

				MARGARET
		Can I open it?

				DAVID
		Sure ...

	Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She
	puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of
	pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points
	her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a
	summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the
	corner.

	WIDER.

	David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret
	looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and
	two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with
	BLACK AND WHITE faces ...

				DRIVER
		Hello Bud ...

				DAVID
			(clipped)
		Hello Whitey.

	They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and
	arrogant.

				WHITEY
			(more pointed)
		Hello Margaret.

				MARGARET
		Hello Whitey ...

				WHITEY
			(loud)
		Hey Bud, how come you're not at
		the town meeting right now?

				DAVID
			(curt)
		No reason.
			(pause/
			firing back)
		How come you're not?

				WHITEY
		Oh. We're s'posed to go out and
		let everybody know about it. See.

	He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of
	Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and
	leers ...

				WHITEY (CONT)
		No reason hunh ... See I thought
		maybe it was cause you were too
		busy entertaining your colored
		girlfriend.

	Margaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF
	LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around
	her and pulls her close.

				DAVID
		Why don't you guys just get the
		hell out of here.

				WHITEY
		Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that.

	He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns
	toward Margaret.

				WHITEY (CONT)
			(leering more)
		You know Margaret, you can come
		over and bake those Oatmeal cookies
		for me anytime you want to.

	They share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels
	out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David
	holds her tighter ...

				DAVID
		It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.

	She nods, groping for reassurance ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

	The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing.
	Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the
	audience.

				WOMAN
		Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.

				ED MCFADDEN
		It's always been blue!

				WOMAN
		Not that blue!

				MAN
		There's a big tree turning orange
		in Joe Baker's front yard!

	SHOT. GEORGE.

	He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on
	his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ...

				BOB
		People, people ... I think we all
		know what's going on here.

	SHOT. BOB.

	Bob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit.

				BOB
		Obviously certain "changes" have
		been happening. Up until now, things
		in Pleasantville have always been--
		well ... "Pleasant." And, recently,
		certain things have become ...
		"Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me
		the first thing we have to do is to
		separate out the things that are
		pleasant, from the things that are
		"Un-Pleasant."

	There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ...

				BOB (CONT)
		George, why don't you and Burt
		take the lead on this. Why don't
		you put together kind of an
		"Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ...

								CUT TO:

	INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

	Mr. Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and
	stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass. There is a
	knock at the door ...

	WIDER.

	Mr. Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it.
	Betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a
	"Lady Samsonite Weekender" bag. She stares up into his eyes.

								DISSOLVE TO:

	FULL SHOT. SHOP WINDOW. MORNING.

	Burt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every
	morning, only today there is a slight difference. He swings
	open the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a
	newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window:

	"NO COLOREDS"

	SERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS.

	As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more
	"NO COLOREDS" signs appear in the windows: next to the
	donuts ... by fishing poles ... beside the stationery
	supplies ... Everything else looks frighteningly the same...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

	Joey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning
	rounds. He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the
	bakery. Then he throws right toward the post office. Then he
	turns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams
	into a trash can ...

	WIDER. SODA SHOP.

	Where Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene,
	there is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A
	NUDE version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in
	curving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just
	stares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he
	possibly can ...

								CUT TO:

	MAIN STREET. LATER ...

	David is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and
	doesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr. Johnson's
	soda shop. After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the
	window ...

	CLOSER. DAVID.

	His eyes go wide. The murmur of the crowd grows louder as
	stray derisive comments rise above the noise. David glances
	from the nude in window to the growing angry mob ...

	MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David goes tearing through the business district looking for
	any sign of his "mother." He glances in the flower shop ...
	toward the green grocer ... David is just about to turn on
	Elm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the
	sky ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (OS)
		Bud ...

	David stops and looks to his right. There, in the window of
	the Philco TV store, are twenty screens of various sizes
	displaying the image of Dick Van Dyke.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		I want a word with you ...

				DAVID
			(scared)
		Oh--well ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(BOOMING)
		NOW!

	The sound reverberates like God Himself. David ducks inside
	the store, slamming the door behind him.

	INT. STORE.

	Fifty Dick Van Dyke's stare at him from every TV in the
	store. The effect is smothering.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(still pretty loud)
		What the hell do you think you're
		doing!

	David glances around, not sure where to look.

				DAVID
			(terrified)
		What do you mean?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		What do I MEAN!
			(beat)
		You think this is a toy? You think
		it's your own little goddamn
		coloring book ...

				DAVID
		Look--it just sort of "happened" ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		A deluge doesn't just "happen."
		Bolts of lightning don't just
		"happen" ...
			(louder)
		You burned down an ELM tree for
		Christ's sake ...

				DAVID
		I had nothing to do with that.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory.
		What episode does the orgy happen
		in, again?

				DAVID
		Look ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		It was a gift Bud. It was so
		special. You liked these things
		as much as I did, remember:
		Warm smells in the family kitchen?
		A smile from a stranger? You know
		how rare that is?

				DAVID
			(beat/
			quietly)
		... Only if they mean it.

	Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the
	face.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING
		TO PISS ME OFF!

				DAVID
			(finding courage)
		I didn't do anything wrong.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh no? Let me show you something!

	SHOT. TV SCREEN.

	All at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of
	the screen containing the image of David and Margaret at
	Lover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the
	BRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts
	it to his mouth and takes a bite.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		"YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE."

	The image of David biting the apple PLAYS BACKWARDS AND
	FORWARDS like some football instant replay ...

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS
		PARADISE!

	WIDER.

	David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on
	the TV screens.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(quickly)
		Where's the remote control I gave
		you?

				DAVID
		Why?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Because you're coming home. I'm
		gonna put this place back the way
		it was.

				DAVID
		No you're not.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		EXCUSE ME?

				DAVID
			(gathering strength)
		I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(nuts)
		JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!

	He lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the
	"barrier."

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		OW!

				DAVID
			(terrified)
		I'm going to leave now.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		You're not going anywhere. You're
		gonna get that remote and you're
		gonna come home and we're gonna
		make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!

	Dick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves
	the shop.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Don't make me get rough with you!
		I can get awfully fucking rough!

	ELM STREET. DAY.

	David sprints down the tree lined street toward his house.
	The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN
	even this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's
	hedge and goes tearing up his front walk.

	INT. FOYER.

	The door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David
	glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He
	crosses into the living room.

	INT. LIVING ROOM.

	David rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at
	it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.

	MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to
	stash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville
	Travel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various
	destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't
	see much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a
	drain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the
	street.

	WIDER.

	David turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main
	Street. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to
	his feet as the voices get louder.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a
	group of young men who circle around her, taunting and
	harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:
	BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd
	circles her like a pack of dogs.

	CLOSER. BETTY.

	The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the
	black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high
	with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one
	another "Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's
	under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her
	picture ..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she
	quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to
	the ground ...

	WIDER.

	David shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into
	the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the
	side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is
	as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)
	David steps in front of his "mother" with both fists
	clenched.

				DAVID
			(as scared as she is)
		Come on!

	He plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black
	and white thugs just stares at it.

				DAVID (CONT)
		COME ON!

	ANGLE. CROWD.

	They look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the
	side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running
	down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts
	backing away.

				DAVID
		Get out of here!

	They back away further and David takes a threatening step.
	The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother."

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER)

	David moves up to her gently.

				DAVID
		Are you alright?

	She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David
	reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go
	wide.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(off her look)
		What?

	CLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER.

	Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She
	opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected
	image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID.

	He holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The
	courage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look
	at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle
	arm around her shoulder.

				DAVID
			(quietly)
		Come on.

	He begins to lead her up toward the corner.

								CUT TO:

	FULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY.

	A larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude
	painting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are
	even louder. The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway.
	After a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ...

	WIDER.

	A big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the
	fever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an
	instant, Mr. Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed. The
	CHEERING grows louder ...

	Almost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together.
	The door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon
	all that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND
	BROKEN GLASS.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	It is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables
	ripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick
	in the front of the juke box ...

	EXT. MAIN ST. DAY.

	David and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being
	destroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection
	watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok.
	After a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET
	comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped
	open.

				DAVID
		Oh my God.

	He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David
	strokes her hair.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Are you alright? Are you okay?

	She nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two,
	then glances down to her side ...

	WIDER.

	She is clutching the umbrella in her left hand. The thing has
	been ripped to shreds. The spines are broken and the fabric
	is torn. Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of
	confusion and shame. David goes white with rage and looks
	toward the mob.

				BETTY
			(taking his arm)
		No. Let's get out of here.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. (LEADING TO LOVER'S LANE).

	They all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning
	road. It has turned completely PINK with the dogwood petals.
	David winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for
	refuge. He clutches the wheel tight.

				DAVID
		We should be okay up here.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

	The car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road. After a
	moment, Lover's Lane reveals itself. It is lush and green
	like before only this time, there is one major difference. A
	phalanx of BLACK AND WHITE THUGS have created a roadblock in
	the foreground.

	WIDER.

	David jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier. It is a
	weird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in
	front with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind--
	like some perfect dream you can never get to. The thugs have
	turned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs
	across the road. They hold axe-handles in their hands.

				DAVID
			(a whisper)
		We better go.

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	Darkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on. Some
	debris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of
	the mob still fill the air. David rolls back into town with
	the headlights off.

	CLOSER. CAR.

				MARGARET
		Where are they?

				DAVID
		I'm not sure.

	They head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at
	once, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car ...

	REVERSE ANGLE. THEIR POV.

	A BONFIRE has been lit in the middle of the street between the
	library and the barber shop. Twenty to thirty people are
	gathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright
	ORANGE FLAMES shoot into the air.

	ANGLE. CAR.

	David pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide ...

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	From closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning. Huge
	piles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,
	waiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory
	atmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with
	the glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker. David sees
	something and bolts from the car ...

				DAVID
		Oh my God.

	ANGLE. SIDE OF THE BONFIRE.

	Jennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff.
	He clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist
	trying to stop him from throwing it on the fire ...

				JENNIFER
		Don't! Just let go.

				BIFF
		It's better, Mary Sue.

				JENNIFER
		I said, NO!
			(yanking it)
		... I've read like one book in my
		whole life and I'll be damned if I
		let you throw it on that fire ...

	Jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then
	suddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony
	when Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other
	direction.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET.

	She sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop
	when a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to
	scream but David puts a hand to her mouth.

				DAVID
			(a whisper)
		It's okay. It's me.

								CUT TO:

	WIDE SHOT. SODA SHOP. OTHER SIDE OF MAIN STREET.

	The crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark
	wreckage of the soda shop. Several stools lie out in the
	street and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered
	around the sidewalk. It is eerily quiet.

	WIDER.

	David, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the
	street with the lights off. He unlatches the door handle and
	gets out slowly. The rest of them follow him into the empty
	street as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some
	platoon on patrol.

	REVERSE ANGLE.

	As they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view. Half
	a booth ... a soda spigot ... After a moment or two Jennifer
	looks up and gasps.

	CLOSER.

	Several teenagers step out of the shadows. They have scraped
	faces and ripped clothing--the signs. Most are dazed and ALL
	OF THEM ARE IN COLOR. After a second or two, more appear:
	Mary Jane ... Lisa Anne ... The boy who was reading Huck
	Finn...

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	The kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of
	course he doesn't. The sounds of the Mob still carry through
	the air from somewhere off in the distance.

				DAVID
		Let's go inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	The place is just sad. All the remnants of what they had are
	strewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over. The
	stools are ripped out of the floor. Betty looks over at the
	corner where he painted her ... The easel is smashed to bits.

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around
	her and draws her close. After a moment or two they HEAR a
	weird SCRAPING sound.

				DAVID
		Hello?

	The SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and
	after a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and
	dustpan.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Just thought I'd try to tidy it up
		a bit.

	Betty runs across and throws her arms around him. The
	teenagers watch as she holds him tight.

				MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
		It's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll
		be alright again ...

	Betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. No one says
	anything while they just embrace for a moment. Finally ...

				DAVID
		Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn
		these booths back up. "Mary Sue",
		why don't you help me slide this in
		front of the door. We'll be okay in
		here.

	They respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids
	start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage.
	Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as
	the kids try to put their shop back together.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT.

	Big Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The
	atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a
	lynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills.
	Bob points his finger.

				BOB
		This is not the answer people.

	The crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern.

				BOB (CONT)
		No matter how upset we may get, or
		how frustrated we may be, we're
		not gonna solve our problems out
		in the street. It's just the wrong
		way to do it. We have to have a
		"Code of Conduct" we can all agree
		to live by.

	His tone grows softer--more concerned ...

				BOB (CONT)
		Now, I asked George and Burt here
		to sketch out some ideas-and I
		think they've done a terrific job.
			(beat/
			scans the crowd)
		If we all agree on these then we
		can take a vote and I think we'll
		start to move in the right direction.

	ANGLE. CROWD.

	They murmur and nod ...

				BOB
			(reading from the
			CODE OF CONDUCT")
		"ONE: All public disruption and
		acts of vandalism are to cease
		immediately."

	EXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT.

	It is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in
	VOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb.

	SHOT. FIRETRUCK.

	The same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls
	several yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely
	contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and
	extinguish the raging bonfire ...

				BOB
		"TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville
		are to treat one another in a
		courteous and "pleasant" manner ..."

	SERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS.

	The CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in
	rapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop
	windows ...

	SODA SHOP.

	Debris is still strewn around the street. A dim light
	emanates from inside.

	INT. SODA SHOP.

	It looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to
	fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads
	the code of conduct out loud by flashlight.

				LISA ANNE
		"Courteous and Pleasant manner."
		That doesn't sound too bad.

	David just looks at her then continues.

				DAVID
			(reading from THE CODE)
		"THREE: The area commonly known as
		Lover's Lane as well as the
		Pleasantville Public Library shall
		be closed until further notice."

	This sends a murmur amongst the kids.

				DAVID (CONT)
		"FOUR: The only permissible
		recorded music shall be the
		following: Pat Boone, Johnny
		Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones,
		The marches of John Phillips
		Souza or the Star Spangled
		Banner. In no event shall any
		music be tolerated that is not of
		a temperate or "pleasant" nature."

				VARIOUS KIDS
			(overlapping)
		"Oh my gosh ... No ..."

	David holds up his hand.

				DAVID
		"FIVE: There shall be no public
		sale of umbrellas or preparation
		for inclement weather of any kind."

	Various glances dart back and forth between them. David
	continues.

				DAVID (CONT)
		"SIX: No bedframe or mattress may
		be sold measuring more than 38
		inches wide."
			(pause)
		"SEVEN: The only permissible exterior
		paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or
		GRAY, despite the recent availability
		of certain alternatives."

	David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly.
	Betty clutches his hand.

				DAVID (CONT)
		"EIGHT: All elementary and high
		school curriculums shall teach the
		"non-changist" view of history--
		emphasizing "continuity" over
		"alteration."
			(David pauses)
		Wow.

	David lowers the paper.

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	It is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a
	moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares
	down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of
	sadness.

	Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling
	with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was
	being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.

				BOY
		Hey. This thing works.

	He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop.
	RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive
	time.

				BUDDY HOLLY
		Well all the things that you say
		and do Make me want to be with
		you-oo-oo ...

				LISA ANNE
			(suddenly/
			in a panic)
		Turn that off!

	The boy looks back at her.

				LISA ANNE (CONT)
			(shrieking)
		You're not allowed to do that now!

	He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox
	winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it.
	David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear
	tone.

				DAVID
		Sure you are.

	He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids
	watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.

	WIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.

	Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly
	different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to
	an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious
	reputation.

				BUDDY HOLLY
		The little things that you say and do
		Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ...
		RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ...
		RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...

	Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an
	arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little
	safer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they
	don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel
	ashamed.

	Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE
	ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the
	helm of his ship ...

	EXT. STREET. LATER ...

	He steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David
	motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge.
	The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is
	silent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids.

				DAVID
			(whisper)
		Stick together till you get off
		Main Street.

	They nod and head off down the block. David just watches them
	silently from the wreckage of the soda shop ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT.

	The Fire Department is cleaning up the charred remains of the
	bonfire ...

	INT. SODA SHOP. LATER ...

	Betty is asleep in one of the booths. Jennifer sleeps beside
	her on the floor. David and Margaret sleep next to them in
	another booth with Margaret curled up against his chest.
	David opens his eyes.

	REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

	Mr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at
	the large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He
	just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it.
	There's a faraway look in his eye.

	SHOT. DAVID.

	He rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret.
	David crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.

				DAVID
		It's okay. We'll get you a new one.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(softly)
		I don't know what I'd do if I
		couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just
		don't know what I'd do ...

	CLOSE UP. DAVID.

	He just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He
	picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just
	looks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks
	for a second.

				DAVID
		Maybe I have an idea.

								CUT TO:
	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAWN.

	The same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down
	Main Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws
	right toward the post office, then left toward the hardware
	store, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.

	CLOSER.

	This time the boy slams into a lamp post. He tumbles off his
	bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief ...

	HIS POV. TOWN HALL.

	Two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of
	paint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST
	UTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR.
	Instead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life.
	The post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky
	shines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town
	could look like. David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to
	their own signatures. David opens his eyes and sees the
	paperboy ...

	ANGLE. PAPER BOY.

	He turns around and rides away as fast as he can.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. LATER ...

	A huge crowd has gathered. There is a loud buzz in the air.
	David and Mr. Johnson stand side by side in front of their
	work like they're presenting and guarding it at the same
	time.

	REVERSE ANGLE. CROWD.

	Most of the faces are black and white. A few near the back
	are in color. Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd,
	hurriedly buttoning his shirt. The buzz grows and the people
	part as he heads toward the front of the pack ...

	ANGLE. FRONT OF CROWD.

	When Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr. Johnson flinches
	slightly. David just looks him in the eye and tries to find
	as much courage as he can. "Big" Bob looks up at the color
	rendering of his town with absolute horror. His eye scans the
	green trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink
	clouds on the horizon.

				BOB
			(bellowing)
		Did you do this?

				DAVID
			(quietly but clearly)
		Yes I did.

	Bob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.

				BOB
		Do you know that it's illegal?

				DAVID
			(thinks)
		Yes I do.

	Bob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing
	but just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his
	hair, shaking his head.

				BOB
		BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

				DAVID
		Because anybody should be able to
		paint in whatever color they want.

	ANGLE. BACK OF CROWD.

	Betty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the
	spectacle. There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of
	love. Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother ...

	SHOT. BOB.

				BOB
		You're not allowed to do this! I
		could arrest you for this.

				DAVID
		Still doesn't make it right.

	There is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes
	widen. His face goes flushed (darker gray). A vein bulges in
	his neck. He turns to the police chief.

				BOB
		Dan! Arrest them!

				DAN (POLICE CHIEF)
			(quietly)
		Um ... I don't know how to do that,
		Bob.

				BOB
		What do you mean!?

				DAN
		Well, I never had to do it before.

				BOB
		You put handcuffs on them and you
		take them to the police station.

				DAN
			(thinks)
		Oh. guess I could do that, then.

				DAVID
			(suddenly stronger)
		C'mere, Dan. I'll help you.

	David walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out.
	A louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually
	helps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join
	them and the murmur starts to grow ...

								CUT TO:

	NIGHT TIME.

	A bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky ...

	EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

	A group of "colored" kids hangs out on Main Street near the
	police station. They gaze off into the distance at the barred
	window of a jail cell. It is elevated half a story above the
	street. Everything is black and white except for the warm
	YELLOW LIGHT, that glows through the bars. They know in a
	glance who's inside.

	INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.

	David sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has
	never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the
	sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling.

	INT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ...

	Mr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He
	clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in
	true "inmate" fashion.

	REVERSE ANGLE. WALL.

	Rather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr.
	Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall
	complete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at
	his work and smiles.

	SHOT. POLICE CHIEF.

	He approaches David's cell from the other direction and
	knocks gently on the bars. David turns around.

				DAN
		There's someone to see you Bud.

	DAVID.

	David sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could
	be. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding
	crosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE
	LOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles.

				DAVID
		I thought it might be you.

	REVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE.

	He stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's
	outfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND
	WHITE.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Hope you're proud of yourself.

				DAVID
		I am actually ... Glad to see you've
		finally shown your true colors.

	Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the
	cell behind him.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Okay, let's cut the shit and get
		right to it. Where's that remote
		control?

				DAVID
		Why?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Because you're coming home.

				DAVID
			(smiles)
		Why don't you just take me back
		without it?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh. You're a smart little bastard
		aren't you?
			(tightly)
		It's kind of like a restricted
		ticket. You gotta leave the same
		way you came.

	David just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back
	on the bunk ...

				DAVID
		So ... I guess as long as I'm
		here, all sorts of things could
		happen to this place. We could
		have pink lawns and blue trees ...

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Just gimme the damn remote!

				DAVID
		I'm sorry. I can't do that.

	Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the
	barred window.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		I don't know what went wrong.
		You answered every question. You
		knew every detail. The senior
		Prom ... McIntire's Department
		Store. We had all the same warm
		memories: Sock hops. The Church
		Social ...

				DAVID
		They weren't my memories.
			(beat)
		I borrowed them. It's no good when
		you borrow them.

	Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to
	tremble.

				DICK VAN DYKE
			(containing his rage)
		How long do you think you've been
		here?

				DAVID
			(warily)
		I don't know ... Three, four weeks.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Much less than that.
			(checks his watch)
		An hour and a half.

	David looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad
	nasty smile.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		See--and this is really great--
		the show was on for what--half an
		hour a week? So that means for
		every week that goes by in
		Pleasantville, only half an hour
		goes by in the real world.

	The smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him.

				DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
		Now Buddy, you're going on trial
		tomorrow. And if they find you
		guilty, you're gonna be stuck here
		forever. Well, not forever--lemme
		think ...
			(calculates)
		Five year sentence ... Carry the
		three ... That comes out to ...
		sixteen and a half centuries, and
		that's rounding down.

				DAVID
		I'm going on trial tomorrow?

				DICK VAN DYKE
		This is TV pal. They don't fool
		around.

	David is rocked but tries not to show it.

				DAVID
			(stoicly)
		There's worse places.

				DICK VAN DYKE
		Oh sure. For the first hundred
		years. Then it starts to get a
		little monotonous.
			(beat)
		Sleep well.

	He taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him
	out. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down
	the hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David
	looks around his cell, truly afraid.

	CLOSER.

	He stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the
	ceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it
	... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David
	crosses to the small window and looks out.

	HIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.

	Across the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall
	complete with the newly painted mural. The "Utopian" view of
	Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable
	exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to
	BLACK AND WHITE.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

	It is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the
	front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history.
	There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.

	INT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

	The place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce
	meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews
	and ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous
	configuration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped
	across the back wall.

	ANGLE. BENCH.

	At the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is
	a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the
	front. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings
	finally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange
	combination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind." Big Bob
	bangs the gavel ...

	CLOSER.

	The undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the
	pews are Black and White. There is a "colored" section in the
	back for standing room only.

	ANGLE. JURORS BOX.

	George is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his
	relationship to one of the defendants. He is dressed
	impeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel.
	After a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of
	the room ...

	ANGLE. BETTY.

	She stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces.
	Betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr.
	Johnson. All at once, a hush goes through the crowd.

	ANGLE. DOORWAY.

	It swings open and David and Mr. Johnson are led in wearing
	handcuffs. Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to
	a table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob.
	There is no lawyer present. There is also no prosecutor.

	ANGLE. DAVID.

	He glances around a little confused. (Weird courtroom.) Big
	Bob bangs the gavel.

				BOB
		Bud Parker and William Johnson,
		you have been charged with
		desecration of a public building
		and the intentional use of
		prohibited paint colors in
		violation of the Pleasantville
		Code of Conduct and laws of
		common decency. Do you admit that
		on the night of May 1, you did
		consciously and willfully apply
		the following FORBIDDEN colors to
		the Pleasantville Town Hall:
			(beat)
		Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,
		Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox
		Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson,
		Yellow, Olive and Magenta.

				DAVID
		Um ... Yes I do. Where's our
		lawyer?

				BOB
		We prefer to keep these
		proceedings as "pleasant" as
		possible. I don't think a lawyer
		will be necessary.

	There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the
	black and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then
	proceeds.

				BOB (CONT)
		Do you further admit that this
		was done surreptitiously and
		under the cover of darkness?

				DAVID
		Well--it was dark out ...

				BOB
		Good. Do you further admit that
		this unnatural depiction occurred
		in full public view where it was
		accessible to, and in plain sight
		of, minor children?

				DAVID
		It was accessible to everyone.

				BOB
		Very well. Let the record show
		that the defendants have answered
		in the affirmative to all the
		charges.

	He looks directly at them for the first time.

				BOB (CONT)
		Do you have anything to say in
		your defense?

	SHOT. DEFENSE TABLE.

	Mr. Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified.

				MR. JOHNSON
		I didn`t mean to hurt anybody.
		I just have to paint ... I
		need to.

	He gropes for something else to say, but what else is there?
	David glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat.
	David rises from his chair.

				DAVID
		I think I've got something to say.

				BOB
		Very well ...

	David looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he
	looks back at Big Bob.

				DAVID
		I think I know why you're doing
		this. I mean, I understand why
		you're doing this. I used to
		feel the same way. I used to
		want this place to stay just the
		way it was. I never wanted it to
		change ...

	There is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(he smiles slightly)
		But nothing stays the same. You
		get things, and you lose things,
		and that's the good part and the
		bad part--but you can't have a
		good part without a bad part.

	He turns and sees his mother in the balcony. They lock eyes
	for a moment. David smiles slightly and continues.

				DAVID (CONT)
		It's like the basketball team.

				BOB
			(leaning forward)
		The basketball team?

				DAVID
		Sure. Everybody's upset because
		they're not winning anymore--but
		just think how it would feel if
		all of a sudden they do win.

	There's a murmur in the gallery.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Wouldn't it feel better than when
		they used to win all the time?

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob looks concerned.

				DAVID (CONT)
		See, I know you want it to stay
		"Pleasant" but there are so many
		things that are so much better:
		like Silly ... or Sexy ... or
		Dangerous ... or Wild ... or
		Brief ...
			(beat)
		And every one of those things is
		in you all the time if you just
		have the guts to look for them.
			(pointing to the "colored" section)
		Look at those faces back there.
		They're no different than you are.
		They just happened to see
		something inside themselves that
		you don't want to ...

				BOB
		Okay--that's enough!

				DAVID
		I thought I was allowed to
		defend myself.

				BOB
		You're not allowed to lie.

				DAVID
		I'm not lying ... Here I'll show
		you.

	He turns suddenly toward the jury box.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Mr. Simpson ...

				MR. SIMPSON
		Yes.

				DAVID
		What color is that hedge of yours?

				MR. SIMPSON
		Green.

				DAVID
		No, not that hedge. The other one.

				MR. SIMPSON
		The other one?

				DAVID
		The one in your mind. The one
		that you see on a bright cold
		morning. The one that you see
		when you walk in front of your
		house and you just stand there
		and stare.

	Mr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy
	look in his eye.

				DAVID (CONT)
		What color is that hedge?

	CLOSE UP. MR. SIMPSON.

	SUDDENLY AND BEFORE OUR EYES, MR. SIMPSON TURNS TO LIVING
	COLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob bangs
	the gavel.

				BOB
		I said, that's enough!

				VARIOUS VOICES FROM
				THE AUDIENCE
		"No ... Let him finish ... Go on ..."

	Big Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David
	suddenly turns toward George.

				DAVID
		Alright. Dad ...

	DIFFERENT ANGLE.

	There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen
	while David confronts his "father." George straightens up.

				GEORGE
			(solemn)
		Yes Bud.

				DAVID
			(beat)
		Don't you miss her?

	CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

	He looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody
	listens. George just stares at him like he got shot.

				DAVID
		I mean, of course you do, but it
		isn't just the cooking or the
		cleaning that you miss--it's
		something else, isn't it ...

	George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as
	he glances toward the back of the room.

				DAVID (CONT)
			(softer whisper)
		Maybe you can't even describe it.
		Maybe you only know it when it's
		gone. Maybe it's like there's a
		whole piece of you that's missing
		too.
			(shrugs)
		You might even call it "love."

				BIG BOB
			(BANGING the gavel loudly)
		Okay, that's IT!!!

				DAVID
			(motioning toward the back)
		Now don't you think she looks just
		as pretty in color? Don't you
		think she looks just as pretty as
		she did the day you met her?

	Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls
	down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a
	long trail of COLOR behind it.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Don't you wish you could tell her
		that?

	He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him
	through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.

				BOB
			(POUNDING the gavel)
		YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!

				DAVID
		Why am I out of order?

				BOB
		BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO
		TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!

				DAVID
		Well I don't think it's a circus.
		And I don't think they do either.

	David motions behind him to the black and white section.
	There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.

				BOB
		THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.

				DAVID
		But see that's just the point. It
		can't stop at once. Because it's
		in you. And you can't stop
		something that's in you.

				BOB
			(tightly)
		It's not in ME.

				DAVID
		Oh sure it is.

				BOB
		No it isn't.

	He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans
	over the bench and gets right up in his face.

				DAVID
			(smug whisper)
		What do you want to do to me
		right now?

	Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves
	closer.

				DAVID (CONT)
		C'mon. Everyone's turning colors.
		Kids are making out in the street.
		No one's getting their dinner--
		hell, you could have a flood any
		minute ... Pretty soon you could
		have the women going off to work
		while the men stayed home and
		cooked ...

				BIG BOB
		That's not going to happen!

				DAVID
		But it could happen.

				BIG BOB
		No it couldn't!

	Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts
	around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of
	his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely
	RED IN THE FACE.

	WIDER.

	A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and
	just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big
	Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window.

	CLOSE UP. BIG BOB.

	He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down
	at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob
	freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and
	flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom.

	ANGLE. DOORWAY.

	As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town
	Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep
	green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators
	bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd
	moves outside.

	EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)

	All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars,
	Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally
	turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David
	walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his
	creation. The whole town is washed in joy.

	WIDER.

	Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet
	in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of
	conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like
	spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and
	looks at her brother making out.

				JENNIFER
		Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ...

	David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David
	throws his arms around his sister as more and more people
	stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...

								DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

	David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She
	clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.

				DAVID
		Are you sure?

				JENNIFER
		I told you. I'm like positive.

				DAVID
		This thing works. We could go
		home right now.

				JENNIFER
		I'm not ready yet. I gotta do
		this for a little while.

	WIDER.

	They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge).

	A large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first
	time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning.
	Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit
	of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the
	distance.

				JENNIFER
		Besides. You think there's like
		a chance I'm gonna get into
		college back there?

				DAVID
			(thinks ...)
		Honestly ... no.

	They both smile.

				DAVID (CONT)
		You got the admissions letter.

				JENNIFER
		Right here.

				DAVID
		And you're sure about this?

				JENNIFER
		I've done the slut thing, David.
		It's really kinda old.

	David nods.

				DAVID
		I'll come back and check on you
		in a month.

	Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a
	couple of seconds.

				JENNIFER
		You're like the coolest brother
		in the world.

	David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly
	hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge
	Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at
	the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at
	her brother, then turns toward the door ...

	EXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY.

	She clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of
	oatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's
	clothing. Their faces are inches apart.

				MARGARET
		You're gonna forget about me.

				DAVID
		No I won't. I swear.

	Margaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her
	arms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft
	kiss. The umbrella falls to the ground ...

				MARGARET
			(a whisper)
		I like calling you David.

				DAVID
		I like it too.

	INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM.

	David stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at
	his side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr.
	Johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Well how do you know it won't go
		back to the way it was?

				DAVID
		You're gonna keep painting aren't
		you?

	Mr. Johnson nods.

				DAVID (CONT)
		Well ...

	He nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other
	one last time.

				MR. JOHNSON
			(remembering something)
		Oh.
			(reaching into his pocket)
		I've got something for you.

	He pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it
	to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.

	INSERT. PAPER.

	It is a small painted replica of their mural in the same
	vibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like
	the one on the wall.

	SHOT. DAVID.

				DAVID
		It's beautiful.

				MR. JOHNSON
		Just a little--You know.

	David looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances
	toward the door.

	WIDER.

	Betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag. A sweater
	is draped over her arm.

				BETTY
			(extending the bag)
		I made you these for the trip.
		They're marshmallow rice squares.

				DAVID
		Thanks. I thought you weren't
		gonna ...

				BETTY
			(painful/
			quieter)
		I had to say goodbye.

	She looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him
	the bag.

				BETTY (CONT)
		There's a meatloaf sandwich in
		there too. Don't go skipping
		dinner just 'cause you're not
		here anymore.

				DAVID
		I won't.

				BETTY
			(voice quivering)
		And ... wear this on the trip in
		case it gets cold.

				DAVID
			(nodding)
		... It's a pretty short trip.

	She nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders
	anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then
	she throws her arms around his neck.

				BETTY
		I'm so proud of you, Bud.

				DAVID
		Thanks ... I love you.

				BETTY
		I love you too.

	She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty
	flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.

				BETTY (CONT)
		Well ...

	She steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the
	remote.

				DAVID
		You better stand back a little.

	Betty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room.
	David points the remote at the TV ...

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY.

	All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A
	WESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second
	or two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform
	synchronization.

	INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM.

	He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his
	new/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The
	black onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen
	TV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles.
	The place is inadvertantly in black and white.

	CLOSER.

	He reaches forward and turns on the TV (by hand) flipping
	around the dial. Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute ...
	Tony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial ...
	Court TV is doing an O.J. recap. David unfolds Mr. Johnson's
	sketch and glances down at it. He smiles to himself. A
	different kind of nostalgia ...

	(Opens when the camera is underwater.)

Voice
Who am I? I've been dreaming about this world which doesn't exist 
in my memory. 
	(Mew swims by)
Who are you? Wait! Am I apart of you...? Or not...?
	(Camera goes into a darker place with orange bubbles then 
it shows someone's eye open. Human figures are seen outside where 
he is.)
Where is this? Who am I? Who brought me here?
	
	(We now see who the voice belongs to, it's Mewtwo.)

Mewtwo
Who am I and why am I here? I just appeared here. I haven't even 
been born to this world yet. Who am I?
	(Mewtwo opens his eyes completely and shatters the glass 
and all the wires fall of him!)

Scientist
It has awakened!

Mewtwo
Did he do this? 

Scientist
Wonderful! Mewtwo has been completed.

   

Mewtwo
Mewtwo?

Scientist
That's you. We created you from a Mew the rarest pokémon in the 
world! Yes, that's the pokémon which is said to be the most rare 
of all pokémon. Mew.

Mewtwo
Mew? Is that my parent? My father? My mother?

Scientist
You can say that, but not really. You've been made stronger based 
on a Mew.

Mewtwo
Who is this? If neither my father nor mother. Then was it god? 
Did God create me?

Scientist
In the world the only ones that can create new life is man and 
god.

Mewtwo
Who did this? Humans made me?

Scientist
This is truly a victory for science.

Another scientist
With this we've proven our theory correct. We can continue the 
study.

Third scientist
This place will become the new Mecca.

Scientist
	(all shaking hands)
I'm going to contact the other offices.

Mewtwo
Who am I? Where is this place? What was I born for?
	(Mewtwo floats up and starts destroying the whole lab. Then 
tons of little metal hand like things come down to stop him but 
he just blows them up. Soon the whole lab is in flames.)

Scientist
To make the strongest pokémon ever.. that was our dream...
	(The whole lab blows up. Giovanni, the leader of Team 
Rocket comes down in a chopper and confronts Mewtwo.)

Mewtwo
Is this my power? I'm the strongest pokémon in the world. Mew. Am 
I stronger then you?

Giovanni
You surly are the strongest pokémon in the world. But there is 
another that would be the strongest.

Mewtwo
The humans?

Giovanni

	(nods)
If you and a human were to cooperate then the world would be 
ours.

  

Mewtwo
The world would be ours?

Giovanni
If your power is set free the world would be ruined. You must 
control your power.

Mewtwo
Control?

Giovanni
Are you okay with destroying the world as it is with that power?

Mewtwo
What should I do? 
	(Giovanni smiles. Mewtwo is at TRHQ getting loads of armor 
put on.)

Mewtwo
Control myself with the armor that protects me? What are you 
going to make me do?

Giovanni
It's simple. All you have to do are the things everyone else has 
been doing...

Mewtwo
and that is?

Giovanni
Fighting, destruction, and plunder. The stronger will win.

--------------------------------------------------------
Mewtwo is sent into an arena to fight pokémon first an Onix which 
Mewtwo throws into a wall with his mind. Then it shows Mewtwo out 
in a field with a lot of wild Tauros. He raises them up with his 
mind control and TR throws pokéballs out and catches them all. 
Then it shows Mewtwo in the gym again fighting Alakazam, Mewtwo 
does just what he did to Onix. Then came Electron and he used an 
electric attack and Mewtwo reflected it back at him. Next came 
Gary's Arcanine and Nidoking... he took care of them easily. Next 
scene, back in Giovanni's lab.
--------------------------------------------------------

Mewtwo
What am I fighting for? What am I living for?

Giovanni
You are a pokémon. Pokémon made by humans, what else are you 
worth?

Mewtwo
My worth? Who am I? What do I live for?
	(Mewtwo starts breaking free of the wires)

Giovanni
What are you doing?

Mewtwo
I was made by humans. But I, who was created by humans, am not 
even a pokémon.
	(Mewtwo blows up the place and flies off while all his 
armor slowly falls of into the sea. He lands on a rock.)
Who am I? Where is this place? Who asked to make me? Who wished 
to make me? I hate everything that made me! So this is neither an 
attack not a declaration of war but revenge on you who made me!

----------------------------------------------------
Introduction
----------------------------------------------------


	(Brock is cooking lunch for everyone.)

Narrator
Ash and the others are on a journey training to be pokémon 
masters. It's a beautiful day so they take a break in a field.

Ash
Is it ready yet?

Misty
Ash you can help too.

Ash
I can't I can't even move one millimeter because I'm so starved.

Brock
Stew well and raise slowly. You mustn't be in a rush with both 
soup or pokémon.
	(Pikachu and Togepy spot someone coming)

Pirate
Hey you! The boy over there! Are you Ash from Pallet Town?

Ash
That's right.

Pirate
Can I have a Pokémon battle with you?

Ash

	(runs over to him)
Okay! I must have a solid fight!

Misty
I thought you couldn't move one millimeter?

Ash
Just one or two pokémon fights before breakfast.

Brock
This is lunch, so that would be before lunch.

Pikachu
pika..chu...


	(Has the Japanese Pokémon intro music through this battle 
the whole time. Ash pulls out a pokéball and throws out 
Bulbasaur. Then the pirate throws out Donfan. Bulbasaur charges 
and Donfan rolls into a ball and hits Bulbasaur, then turns 
around and hits him again! Then he tries it again but Bulbasaur 
uses Solar Beam and Donfan faints. The Pirate then sends out 
Machamp. Ash sends out Squirtle. Machamp kicks Squirtle down and 
then goes to kick him again but Squirtle dodges it and bubbles 
him till Machamp faints. The pirate gets mad and throws 3 
pokéballs down. one is a Venomoth another is a Golem and the 
other is a Pinsir. Pikachu jumps off ashes shoulder and does 
Thundershock and all 3 faint.)

   

Pirate
Oh My God! 
	(this was possibly the funniest part of the entire movie :)

Ash
I did it!

Misty
It was just because your opponent was weak.

Brock
He didn't even raise them well


	(flash to Team Rocket who is on a cliff watching our 
heroes.)

James
Pikachu gets stronger and stronger.

Jessie
Beautiful

Meowth
We couldn't beat him even once. But the word surrender isn't in 
our dictionary.

Jessie
I will get that Pikachu.

James
But look at that. 
	(looks at them all eating)

Meowth
I'm so hungry.

Jessie
I got a frying pan...

Meowth
What good is such a thing without meat and vegetables? It's just 
an iron board.

---------------------------------------------
A Fearow with a camera flies over head then it shows inside some 
place where you can see Ash and Pikachu on the screens.
---------------------------------------------

     

Lady
Are you sending them an invitation?

Mewtwo
Certainly.
	(Dragonite flies out of the control center with a purse. It 
flies over the sees and then over Team Rocket and they fall then 
it flies over Ash and everyone's head knocking them all over then 
she lands.)

Ash
What are you? 
	(Dragonite hands Ash an invitation)
This? For me?
	(He hits a button and a hologram of the lady is displayed)

Lady
Please forgive me for the abrupt letter.

Brock
What a beautiful lady...

Lady
Since you are a promising pokémon trainer of the future, we'd 
like to invite you to a party of my master who is the strongest 
pokémon trainer in the world. The place is the New Island, 
Pokémon Castle. Please check the reply card for whether your 
coming or not. Please accept the invitation for the strongest 
trainer in the world.

Brock
Beautiful Lady...

Misty
What do we do?

Brock
Lets go for it. We should go for it.

Ash
I don't feel uncomfortable with being told I'm a promising future 
trainer.

Misty
Well then check yes on the card.


	(They check yes, and hand the invitation back to Dragonite. 
Dragonite takes the card and flies off but Jessie, James and 
Meowth take out a net in an attempt to steal this rare pokémon. 
Ash's invitation falls out of Dragonites purse.)

Jessie
Don't say Goodbye without saying hello.

Meowth
a post card?

---------------------------------------------
Scene change. We see Mewtwo waving his hand back and forth moving 
the clouds, causing a big storm to start. We then see mew 
sleeping in a bubble underwater as the bubble floats to the top 
and pops, Mew wakes up and flies off. Ash and everyone run out of 
the storm and into a ocean side house that has all the other 
trainers who were invited.
---------------------------------------------

A Trainer
Calm down Kingler! Cut it out!
	(Our heroes run inside wet.)

Ash
It was a beautiful day!

Brock
The weather along this beach can change easily.
	(we notice a big crowd of trainers by the door and Officer 
Jenny standing with a woman talking to them all)

Crowd
Huh? The ferry has been canceled?

Sweet
We can't go to the New Island?!

Crowd
Oh No! We were invited to go!

Officer Jenny
Be quiet everyone. Here is the Pier Master.

Boijer
I'm Boijer. If you want to know about the sea ask the seagulls on 
the pier. No need to bother. Just look at the flaw of the clouds. 
I've never seen such a hurricane in all my years.

Officer Jenny
Is it that terrible?

Boijer
I grew up on a port and I've never experienced such a storm. 
Besides the storm is above New Island offshore of this pier. I 
can't let you be placed in danger. That's my wish as the one who 
guards this pier.

Officer Jenny
As you heard the ferry has been cancelled.

Umio
Its okay with my pokémon. My pokémon are stronger in water. I can 
cross the sea.

Boijer
Wait. I'm the one who knows the sea and I say no!

Officer Jenny
She's right! Besides if the pokémon were to get hurt now they 
wouldn't be able to get treatment at a Pokémon Center.

Ash
What do you mean?

Officer Jenny
Nurse Joy at the Pokémon Center is missing. Pokémon can't receive 
treatment without Nurse Joy. The poster over there is the missing 
person report
	(Brock looks at it)

Brock
Beautiful... Who? I've seen her somewhere before...
	(Some of the trainers go outside in the storm wanting to 
cross the ocean. Soroa gets onto his Pidgeot and flies off. Umio 
gets on his Gyarados and swims across.)

Officer Jenny
Stop! Stop or I'll arrest you!
	(Sweet gets on her Dewgong and starts swimming away.)

Boijer
There's no use trying to stop them. After all they're pokémon 
trainers. If they were children who would stop after being told 
to, they wouldn't have gathered here. Let's just pray for there 
safety.
	(Ash, Brock, Misty and Pikachu run outside and see everyone 
leaving.)

Ash
Across the sea lives the strongest trainer in the world. I can't 
cop out now.

Misty
But we can't cross this sea using our pokémon.

Ash
Right.
	(A Small wooden ship pulls up with 2 people in it. Guess 
who?)

Jessie
Want a ride? Not saying that it's free but depending on the 
situation. I might allow you onboard. 
	(They get on and start going and Meowth is dressed like a 
girl in front of the boat, then a huge wave and Team Rocket's 
costumes fall off. then the waves start getting really rough.)

Ash
You guys! You guys again?!

Brock
You guys appear at the very worst times!

Ash
What do you want?

Jessie
If we're asked what we want...

James
The answer to that is..

Meowth
There's no time for saying that!
	(A huge wave flips the boat. Misty shoots out Staryu and 
swims to the surface.)

Brock
Ash! Misty!
	(Misty comes up and he grabs onto Staryu.)

Misty
Where is Ash and Pikachu?!
(A big wave comes again, and they go back under and see As h 
swimming up with Squirtle.)

  

Ash
Hold on tight everyone!
	(Squirtle and Staryu keep swimming under the waves until 
they see light. Then it shows Mew flying above the clouds. Ash 
and everyone get to the castle and climb out of the water, and 
the mysterious lady is standing there.

Lady
Welcome to the New Island. Please show me your invitation.

Ash
How's this?
	(He shows her).

B rock
That was you just as I thought!

Lady
Yes?

Brock
That picture of Nurse Joy I saw in the missing person report at 
the pier was you.

Misty
That reminds me, she looks like her.

Lady
I don't know what your talking about. I've been serving this 
castle ever since I was born. Come this way. The other guests are 
already waiting.

---------------------------------------------
They go inside and Team Rocket floats up from the water on top of 
Weezing. Then it shows Mew playing with the windmill on top of 
the castle. MEANWHILE Ash and everyone are inside the castle.
---------------------------------------------

Lady
Those are the trainers who have already arrived.

Ash
Only 3?

Lady
The trainers who couldn't cross that storm aren't worth inviting.

Brock
So then you tested us?

Lady
Please take out the pokémon from the pokéballs and be seated. You 
are the chosen trainers.

James

	(outside and the front door shuts)
Well then, let's sneak into this castle...

Jessie
The only way is to use the exit.

Meowth
Where's the exit?

Jessie
Over there...

Meowth
The s..s..sewer!? I'm not a brown rat!

Jessie
Don't complain!
	(All of a sudden Mew comes down from behind TR and looks at 
them. Jessie turns her head but Mew disappeared.)

James
What's wrong Jessie?

Jessie
Nothing lets go.

---------------------------------------------
Meanwhile...
---------------------------------------------

Sorao
You came too?

Ash
You?

Sorao
I flew here. My Pidgeot can cross such a hurricane in one flight. 
Everyone greet them! 
	(all his pokémon say their names Then they see a Gyarados.)

Umio
That's my Gyarados. I rode him across the sea. Those kind of 
waves are nothing for it. 

Ash
Gyarados is a brutal pokémon isn't it?

Umio
Yeah, but if you can handle it, no one is more reliable.

Sweet
My pokémon are just the same over there. 
	(points to her Blastoise, Wigglytuff, and more. Then all 
the lights turn off, there is a bright beam of light coming down 
the center of a huge spiral staircase.)

Lady
That you for waiting everyone. The strongest pokémon trainer is 
coming. 
	(All of a sudden Mewtwo starts floating down and all the 
pokémon get worried.)


Lady
Yes, this is the strongest pokémon trainer and strongest pokémon. 
Mr. Mewtwo.
	(The lights come back on and everyone can see him clearly.)

Ash
Mewtwo?

Umio
A Pokémon is a pokémon trainer? It can't be. 
	(It becomes apparent that MewTwo is telepathically 
controlling Joy...)

Mewtwo
I've decided my own rules.

Misty
That voice!

Brock
Telepathy!
	(Mewtwo raises Umio up in the air and throws him into a 
pool 
	(using his mind)

Umio
Darn it! Go Gyarados!
	(Gyarados attacks with Hyper Beam, it goes to Mewtwo and 
Mewtwo stops it and turns it around and it hits Gyarados causing 
it to faint.)

Mewtwo
That was easy. 
	(looks at Joy)
I no longer have any need for you anymore.
	(Joy faints into Brock's arms)

Brock
Nurse Joy.

Nurse Joy
Where is this place? Why am I here?

Mewtwo
To make you take care of me, I took you from the Pokémon Center. 
A doctor who is familiar with pokémon is convenient. You were 
quite useful. You don't remember anything though.

Brock
What did you say?

Mewtwo
Humans can be manipulated in any way with my power.

Misty
With what power?

Pikachu
PIKA!
	(Meanwhile TR are in the castle and they find a strange 
room and they enter it.)


Meowth
What is this place? 
	(They look and see a Charizard, Venusaur and a Blastoise in 
Big Glass Test Tubes sleeping.)

Meowth
Cute!

James
Is it really?

Jessie
These aren't like any treasures I've seen.
	(Jessie walks away and sits on some button and a computer 
turns on with a very fuzzy screen.)

Computer
...our study... to continue in our research ... we would have to 
collect samples from our test subjects...
	(All of a sudden something grabs Meowth and throws him in a 
machine)

Meowth
HELP! HELP!

Jessie
Meowth!
	(Both Jessie and James start pull to get Meowth out and 
they do get him out but not before the machine got 3 hairs from 
off of his tail.)

Meowth
OUCH! My hair!
	(on the computer screen a figure of a Meowth shows up and 
the computer starts saying some weird stuff then in an empty test 
tube next to Team Rocket, a Meowth falls down from a pipe into 
it)

All of TR
MEOWTH?!

Meowth
I am Meowth.

James
Then this is.... Meowth's copy? 
	(Mew appears behind Team Rocket again.)

Computer
But the copy we created is more than we've imaged. The pokémon 
which we found.... in the depths... it's name is Mew... We 
succeeded in finding fossilized eye lashes of a mew. From the 
gathered components we created Mewtwo with this machine. The goal 
was to make the strongest pokémon with our own hands. That was 
our dream. But soon Mewtwo displayed unmeasurable violence. Its 
all over. The research office will be destroyed. The only way 
left to abandon this place and escape. 
	(the computer shuts off)

Jessie
This is the research office?

James
I think so.

Meowth
Yeah

James
But there's nothing wrong with it.

Jessie
Or maybe something created it again.

James
But who?

Mewtwo
I thought of working with humans once. But I was disappointed. 
Humans are the worst creatures inferior to pokémon. If creatures 
that are weak and cruel like humans control this world, this 
planet will come to ruin. 

Brock
Are you saying like your gonna rule it?

Mewtwo

	(shakes his head)
Pokémon are no good either because this planet is ruled by humans 
our pokémon... pokémon who lived for humans.

Pikachu
Pika..pika pika!

Mewtwo
What did you say? You're not being controlled? You're with the 
humans because you want to be? To be with them by itself is 
wrong.
	(Mewtwo lifts Pikachu up with his mind and throws him but 
Ash jumps back and catches him!)

Pikachu
pika!

Ash
Pikachu!

Mewtwo
Weak pokémon rely on humans.

Misty
Ash! Are you ok?

Ash
Yeah. How dare you attack Pikachu?!

Soroa
We can get him no matter what kind of pokémon he is, as long as 
he's a pokémon, GO RYHORN!
	(Ryhorn charges at Mewtwo and is 1 inch from him and Mewtwo 
stops him and raises him into the air, and shoots Ryhorn across 
the room!)

 

Soroa
Ryhorn!

Mewtwo
It's no use. I was born as the strongest of any pokémon in the 
world.

Ash
You don't know that before we try.

Mewtwo
You wan to try?

Ash
We can ask for nothing better.

--------------------------------------------------------
Mewtwo eyes start glowing then it shows in the lab with Team 
Rocket in it Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise come out of there 
test tubes and walk out the door. then Mew flies out with them.
--------------------------------------------------------

James
Was that a..?

Jessie
Mew?



Mewtwo
Any human who are aiming to be pokémon trainers go first. 
Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur.
	(The 3 copies raise up from the ground.)These are the 
evolved forms of the copies I've made. 

Sweet
Copies?

Soroa
They are...?
	(Everything starts shaking and a huge door opens and inside 
is a pokémon battle field.)

Brock
A battle field? Is he going to have a pokémon battle?

Soroa
I've got Venusaur for that copy one!

Sweet
I've got Blastoise for that copy one!

Ash
I've got Charizard too. Charizard I chose you!
	(Charizard comes out and gives Mewtwo and evil look then 
shoots fire out at him but Mewtwo makes a force field around him 
so it doesn't even touch him.)
Charizard, that's a surprise attack. 
	(Mewtwo shoots up water and the fire goes out.)

Mewtwo
What a bad tempered Charizard. So who's first?
	(Soroa's Venusaur walks out.)


Soroa
I was careless before, but it won't go that way this time.


	(The copied Venusaur walks out.)

Soroa
Venusaur! Razorleaf!

Mewtwo
Vine Whip.
	(Copied Venusaur's vines chop up the razor leafs then his 
vines wrap around Venusaur and tosses him across the room!)

Soroa
Venusaur!

Sweet
I'm next! Go Blastoise!
	(Mewtwo points for copied Blastoise to go.)

Sweet
Blastoise, Hydro Pump!
	(Copied Blastoise spins right threw the water and hits 
Blastoise causes him to go crashing hard into the wall.)

Sweet
Blastoise!

 

Misty
Be careful Ash! His skills are strong!

Ash
I know.
	(Mewtwo signals Copied Charizard to go.)

Ash
Charizard! Lets fight with speed not power! Okay go!
	(Both Charizard fly up. Ashes Charizard keeps using Flame-
thrower but copied Charizard dodges them all and keeps hitting 
Charizard in the stomach.)

Misty
Where are the speed attacks?

Brock
The enemy is to fast!
	(Copied Charizard grabs Charizard and starts flying down to 
the ground!)

Ash
Charizard!

Mewtwo
Dive Bomb Slam!

Charizard hits into the ground then gets up.. roars loudly.. then 
faints.

Ash

	(Runs out to Charizard)
Hold on Charizard! Are you okay?

Mewtwo
Both speed and power are lacking.
	(Mewtwo then throws his hands up and 3 black pokéballs 
appear he shoots them all out and captures Sweet's Blastoise 
another gets Soroa's Venusaur and the other captures ashes 
Charizard! A small gold statue lifts up and the 3 balls shoot 
down into the hole.)

Ash
STOP!

Misty
Are you taking the other's pokémon?!

Mewtwo
Taking them? No. I'm going to make stronger copies than the 
pokémon you are so proud of.
	(Mewtwo raises his arms again and hundreds of Black 
pokéballs appear!)
It's suitable enough for me.

Brock
Copies?

Ash
Stop! That's a violation of the rules!

Mewtwo
Don't tell me what to do. 
	(Mewtwo looks at Ash and throws him into Brock)
I've decided my own rules.
	(Mewtwo drops his arms and all the black pokéballs start 
flying everywhere)

Brock
They're Coming!

Ash
Run everyone!

--------------------------------------------------------
The pokéballs are everywhere catching the trainers pokémon, the 
Gyarados was caught then the Golduck, then Seaking, then Scyther, 
then Hitmonlee, then Sandslash the trainers are trying to protect 
there pokémon but there is nothing they can do! then Dewgong was 
caught, then Rapidash, then Vileplume. Then Bulbasaur and 
Squirtle are fighting them off, then Wigglytuff was caught, then 
Pidgeot and when they get caught the pokéballs fly back into the 
whole under the statue lifted up in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------

Ash
I've got it! Take your own pokémon back to your own pokéballs! 
Return Squirtle and Bulbasaur! 
	(they both go back into their pokéballs)


  

Mewtwo
It's no use.
	(2 black pokéballs go to Ash, open, and capture the 
pokéballs Bulbasaur and Squirtle are in!)
Nothing is impossible with the black pokéballs I have made. 
	(Misty puts Togepy in her bag and shuts it tight while 
Brock holds Vulpix close.)

Nurse Joy
This place is no good. Let's run outside!
	(Nurse Joy, Psyduck, Misty and Brock start running but then 
a black ball catches Psyduck)

Misty
My Psyduck!
	(A black ball catches Vulpix.)

Brock
Vulpix!
	(Pikachu is being hunted down by tons of black pokéballs! 
Then Pikachu falls and is about to be caught! But Ash jumps in 
front of him and the pokéballs hit him.)

Ash
Run Pikachu! 
	(Pikachu is running and starts climbing the spiral stairs 
with ash running after him. Pikachu keeps using Thundershock to 
blow up all the pokéballs around him but more keep coming! Ash 
starts running up the stairs a little behind Pikachu)
Don't give up Pikachu! 
	(Pikachu gets tired and he accidentally falls of the 
stairs! Ash jumps after him and is about to grab him but then a 
black pokéballs snatches Pikachu! But Ash catches the pokéball 
and then falls into some water but when he does the pokéballs 
slips out of his hands and goes into the hole. Since it was the 
last pokémon the statue starts to drop but Ash just barely makes 
it and jumps down into the hole after the Pikachu in the ball! 
Team Rocket is still in the Lab, which is where all the copies 
are going. They are amazed at all the copies dropping into all 
the test tubes everywhere but then Ash falls down chasing after 
Pikachu!)

Jessie
Brat?

Ash
I'm sorry, I don't have time to deal with you today!
	(Ash jumps and grabs Pikachu's pokéball but right when he 
does about 25 little metal mini hand like things come down trying 
to keep Pikachu, Ash is fighting off the mini hands.)
Let it go! Darn it! Let him go! Let go of my Pikachu! Let go! 
	(All the hands break and the whole copy machine starts 
blowing up and Pikachu comes out of his ball.)
Pikachu!

Pikachu
Pika!

But then all the Copy pokémon start coming out of there tubes 
because the whole copy machine is all blown up. All the copies 
start walking out of the room.

Jessie
Oh no! There coming out!

Meowth
My copy to!

Ash
Those are all copies?

Jessie
Where are they all going?

All of a sudden there's an explosion and all the black pokéballs 
come out and all the original pokémon come out!

James
The real ones have come out to!

2 of the black balls open and 2 normal pokéballs come out, then 
those open and Squirtle and Bulbasaur come out! Ash and Pikachu 
runs over and starts laughing and hugging each other then ash 
stops and looks up and looks angry!

Meanwhile up stairs...

Mewtwo
Humans, I won't take your lives too. Leave here.

The doors open to the exit.

Mewtwo
That is if you an make it out in that storm.

Then there is an explosion and all the copied pokémon come 
walking out.

Mewtwo
What happened here?

From the smoke, Ash and all the original pokémon come walking 
out.

Ash
I can not forgive...! I will not forgive you!

Misty/Brock
Ash!

Misty

	(sees Psyduck)
Psyduck!

Brock

	(sees Vulpix)
Vulpix!

Mewtwo
Did you set them free?

Ash
I will protect my pokémon, my friends.
	(Ash charges at Mewtwo and goes to punch him but Mewtwo 
throws him down to the ground. Ash gets up and tries again and 
Mewtwo lifts him up.)

Misty
Ash!

Brock
Stop!
	(Mewtwo throws Ash into a huge statue but just as he's 
about to hit it -which we know would really hurt
a pink bubble stops him and Ash bounces a few times on that.)

Mewtwo
What?
	(Mew flies up to Ash and stares at him, Ash then looks at 
Mew and Mew pops the bubble and Ash falls -only like a foot then 
Mew starts giggling.)
You're... 
	(Mew makes another bubble and starts jumping up and own on 
it giggling and having a good time, then Mewtwo makes a black 
electric ball and shoots it up and it pops mew bubble. Mew turns 
around and looks at Mewtwo confused. Mewtwo makes another and 
blows up when it hits Mew. Mewtwo makes 3 more and throws them 
all up at Mew, Mew dodges them all and starts giggling again.)

Brock
That's...

Misty
Pokémon?

Mew flies down and looks at Mewtwo

Mewtwo
Mew. The pokémon that's supposed to be the rarest pokémon in the 
world.

Brock
Mew? 
	(Mew looks around at everyone... I love this guy!)

Mewtwo
I was made from you. But I am the stronger one...I am the true 
one.
	(Mew is still looking around acting like its paying no 
attention to Mewtwo.)

Brock
Mew and Mewtwo.

Sweet
Mewtwo was made from Mew.

Mewtwo

	(starts glowing)
I am the only one who will survive. 
	(Mewtwo starts chasing mew everywhere shooting tons of 
those black electric balls at him. But Mew keeps running away 
dodging everything.)

Mewtwo
Who don't you want to fight? The reason why you avoid fighting is 
because your afraid of me? 
	(Mewtwo makes another black electric ball and shoots it at 
Mew and knocks Mew right in the face and mew goes flying in the 
distance. Everyone is then shocked, but then the same type of 
ball only blue comes back and hits Mewtwo and he goes into a 
wall. Mew flies back down. and Mewtwo floats up from the fire and 
rubble. TR Enters the room.)

Mewtwo
Your attacks are ineffective against me. Now is the time to 
decide which one of us is the true one, you the copy... which is 
the stronger? We were made stronger than the real ones.

Mew
mew, mew..mew mew mew...mew, mew..mew mew mew

Meowth
I see.

Jessie
What is it saying?

Meowth
The real one is real. If they fight only using bodies without 
skills. The true ones will not be beaten by their copies

Mewtwo
The real one is real?.... Fine! 
	(Mewtwo shoots another black electric ball at Mew but Mew 
dodges it and just barely misses Ash! Ash then starts climbing 
down the statue.)
Lets decide which is the real one without skills. You're the 
stronger ones, GO! 
	(All the copies start attacking their originals. The copies 
are winning. Mewtwo makes a visible blue force field around 
himself. Mew does the same except its pink and they fly up high 
in the air and keep ramming into each other. Then Pikachu is 
looking around at the big copy war then he sees his copy standing 
there ready to fight him! Pikachu can't believe it.)


Nurse Joy
What is this fighting? Both the real ones and copies are alive 
now.

Sweet
Everyone is a living thing

Brock
Though they were created, there are living beings that live in 
this world.

Misty
The real ones and the copies... But both of them are the same 
living things. There's no such thing as a win and losing.

James
If we were asked that, I wouldn't know what to say

Jessie
I feel so sorry

James
They're bullying themselves.

Jessie
Its like seeing what we used to be.

James
Its like seeing what we are now.

Both
Feels Bad! 
	(Meowth's copy walks up to Meowth.)

Meowth
Its you! 
	(they take out there claws and are ready fight)
This is gonna hurt. But every pokémon is fighting each other, 
you're unfair.

Copy Meowth
Meow meow...

Meowth
What? I'm more unfair? It's because I'm not fighting with you? 
Your nails would hurt more wouldn't they?

Copy Meowth
meow meow meow

Meowth
You said tonight's moon would be round? You're right, it must be 
a full moon.

Copy Meowth
meow meow

Meowth
Talking about the moon at a time like this is tasteful. Its 
philosophical.
	(Meanwhile Mew and Mewtwo are still bouncing around 
fighting. And Ash finally makes it back to the ground.)

Ash

	(looks at everyone fighting and getting so tired)
That's Enough! Stop!

Brock
Ash!

Ash
I've got to stop them.

Brock
No. The battle will continue unless Mew and Mewtwo stop fighting.

Nurse Joy
Animals don't hand over there territory to the same type of 
animal.

Misty
oh no.

Nurse Joy
They will fight until they drive their opponents away. That is 
the way of living beings.

Brock
That may be for living beings but Mewtwo was made by humans.

Misty
But now he's a living being. 

Ash
Now they are all living beings. Mew and Mewtwo, Pikachu and that 
other Pikachu. 
	(Mew and Mewtwo's fight finally goes on ground and they 
both take off there force field. Mew and Mewtwo both shoots a 
beam out at each other and starts to run between them not seeing 
the 2 beams coming!)
Stop!

Brock
Ash! 
	(Both beams hit Ash and he falls to the ground and turns to 
stone.)

Mewtwo
It can't be. A human tried to stop our fight. 
	(Pikachu runs out to Ash and starts shaking Ash. Then he 
thunder shocks him many times and Ash still doesn't move. Pikachu 
begins to cry. Then all the other pokémon look at Pikachu -
including the copies
and they start crying. All there tears float over and land on ash 
then last, Pikachu's tears fall onto Ash and Ash regains his hold 
on life, and turns back to flesh from rock)

Ash
Pikachu!

Pikachu
Pika pi!!

Mewtwo
Actually, both you and I are pokémon that already exist.

Mew
mew.

Mewtwo
It might be better if no one knows about us, or any of this...

Mew
mew...
	(Mew and Mewtwo start flying away and then all the copies 
pokémon lift up into the air and fly with them!)

Ash
Why are you going everyone?

Mewtwo

	(flying away with all the copies)
We were born and alive. We will continue to live somewhere in 
this world. 
	(All of a sudden the whole castle fills up with bright 
light and everyone disappears......... Now we are back where all 
the trainers what to go on the ferry.)

Officer Jenny
The ferry has been canceled! There's a hurricane coming!

Nurse Joy

	(walks through the crowd)
Don't worry everyone. I'm going to open the Pokémon Center as a 
shelter. Follow me those who need it.

Brock
Nurse Joy, the officer, and Ms. Boijer. Even more beautiful than 
usual when they are wet by the rain.

Ash
But why are we here?

Misty
I don't know. We're here because we're here.

Ash
It doesn't matter. Well... Huh? 
	(Everyone runs outside)
It can't be...

Officer Jenny
The hurricane... it's as if it never existed.

Boijer
I can run the ferry for again tomorrow.

Ash

	(looks up and sees a mew in the sky)
Look.

Misty
What? I can't see anything.

Brock
Besides the clouds.

Ash
On the day I left to become a pokémon trainer, I saw a phantom 
pokémon... and now.. I've seen it again.

Brock
Phantom Pokémon.

Ash
Yes, someday I will 
	(Meanwhile, TR is still on the New Island except now the 
castle is gone.)

Jessie
Well if its this empty...

James
Clean and clear...

Meowth
And different than it usually is. 

Jessie/James/Meowth
FEELS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!
